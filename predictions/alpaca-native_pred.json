        "input": "PURPOSE: A prospective, single institution study was conducted to evaluate the role of positron emission tomography with fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) before and after definitive radiation therapy for patients with head-and-neck cancer. Correlation with CT or MRI imaging and pathologic findings at the time of planned neck dissection was made. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twelve patients with AJCC Stages III-IV cancer of the head and neck received CT or MRI and PET imaging before treatment with definitive radiation therapy. One month after completion of treatment, repeat CT or MRI and PET imaging was obtained. All images were reviewed independently by radiologists who were blind to the results of the other modality. Patients then underwent planned neck dissection. Pathologic correlation with posttreatment scans allowed calculation of the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and the positive predictive value for both CT/MRI and PET. RESULTS: Comparison of CT/MRI to PET obtained before definitive RT revealed both primary tumor and nodal disease were detected by both modalities in all cases where primary tumor was known. After RT, comparison of CT/MRI imaging to findings of neck dissection revealed a sensitivity of 90%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100%, and negative predictive value of 50%. Comparison of PET imaging with pathologic findings demonstrated sensitivity of 45%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100%, and a negative predictive value of 14%.",

This cohort study aims to determine if preoperative stenting adversely affects long-term survival by comparing a group of patients having preoperative stenting (group A) with a group of patients having elective surgery (group B) in a single centre. METHODS: The study is retrospective. Survival was calculated with Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared using the log-rank test. Other group characteristics were compared with Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: From November 1998 to November 2008, 15 patients had preoperative SEMS and were entered in group A. This represented 11.5 % of a total of 130 patients undergoing SEMS insertion in the same period. Group B included 88 consecutive patients undergoing elective left-sided colonic resection for Dukes' B and C cancer excluding mid and low rectal tumours between January 2003 and December 2007. The 30-day mortality rate for groups A and B was 6.7 % (one patient) and 5.7 % (five patients), respectively. The 5-year survival rate was 60 % and 58 %, respectively, with a p value of 0.96.",

METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of 7631 adolescents from 231 Australian schools. Measures included pubertal status, recent (30day) alcohol use, parent-adolescent emotional closeness, family conflict, parental permissiveness of alcohol use and peer alcohol use. The analysis was based on a two-level (individuals nested within schools) logistic regression model, with main effects entered first, and interaction terms added second. RESULTS: The interaction of family factors and pubertal stage did not improve the fit of the model, so a main effect model of family factors and pubertal stage was adopted. There were significant main effects for pubertal stage with boys in middle puberty at increased odds of alcohol use, and girls in advanced puberty at increased odds of alcohol use.",
        "output": "The results of the study showed that parent-adolescent emotional closeness, family conflict, and parental permissiveness all moderate the association between puberty and alcohol use in adolescents. Specifically, parent-adolescent emotional closeness was associated with a lower likelihood of alcohol use in early puberty, while family conflict and parental permissiveness were associated with a higher likelihood of alcohol use in late puberty. These findings suggest that parents may have a role in helping their children navigate the transition to adulthood, particularly during times of increased pubertal development."

METHOD: 120 patients (46 males, 74 females) who presented for possible admission for depression at a psychiatric facility were administered a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of disorders (DSM-IV) based questionnaire and underwent psychiatric evaluation. A question asking whether 'the lights in my surroundings seem dimmer than usual' was included in the 15-point question survey. Statistical analyses were performed to determine whether an affirmative response to this dimness question was correlated with the depth of depression (mild, moderate, severe) and also whether significant correlation was present between the percentage of patients answering yes to the dimness question versus the number of yes responses to the core symptoms of depression. RESULTS: Two thirds of the patients categorized as severely depressed responded that their ambient environment appeared dimmer than usual compared to 21% of moderately and 14% of mildly depressed patients. This difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). The degree of depression as determined by the number of core questions answered affirmatively and the presence of this 'dimness' symptom were highly correlated (P=0.002, R=0.87). LIMITATIONS: The specificity of the finding has not been tested in reference to non-affective psychiatric patient groups.",

The hypothesis that the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of different patients undergoing polysomnography may be seasonally affected was tested. METHODS: The retrospectively analyzed database included 7,523 patients of both sexes who underwent in-laboratory baseline polysomnography to investigate any complaint of disordered sleep, during 1 decade, between January 2000 and December 2009. Data on climate and air pollution were obtained from official organizations. AHI was the main outcome variable. Cosinor analysis, a statistical method for the investigation of time series, was used to detect seasonality. RESULTS: The cosinor analysis confirmed the existence of a circannual pattern of AHI, with acrophase in winter and nadir during the summer. The seasonality is significant even after adjusting for sex, age, BMI, neck circumference, and relative air humidity. Median (25-75 interquartile range) AHI in the 6 months with colder weather was 17.8 (6.5-40.6/h), and in the warmer weather was 15.0 (5.7-33.2/h).

The first measure, appropriate technical quality, was defined as use of either appropriate counseling or psychotropic medications during the prior year for a probable depressive or anxiety disorder. The second, active treatment, indicated whether the respondent had received treatment for a psychiatric disorder in the past year. Covariates included measures of physical and mental health and sociodemographic indicators. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Appropriate technical quality of care was significantly associated with higher levels of satisfaction. The strength of the association was moderate.",

METHODS: The estimation method used a mixed logit model applied to data from the third wave of the Indonesian family life survey (2000). The key variables of interest include medical fee and distance to different types of health care provider and individual characteristic variables. RESULTS: Urban dweller's decision to choose health care providers are sensitive to the monetary cost of medical care as measured by medical fee but they are not sensitive to distance. For those who reside in rural area, they are sensitive to the non-medical component cost of care as measured by travel distance but they are not sensitive to medical fee.",

In rural areas, the availability of health insurance may reduce the financial barrier of seeking care, as people are more sensitive to the non-medical cost of care (travel distance). In urban areas, health insurance may have a greater impact on health care utilization, as people are more sensitive to the medical fee charged by health care providers."

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Gait and cognitive disturbances are common in Parkinson's disease (PD). These deficits exacerbate fall risk and difficulties with mobility, especially during complex or dual-task walking. Traditional gait training generally fails to fully address these complex gait activities. Virtual reality (VR) incorporates principles of motor learning while delivering engaging and challenging training in complex environments. We hypothesized that VR may be applied to address the multifaceted deficits associated with fall risk in PD. METHODS: Twenty patients received 18 sessions (3 per week) of progressive intensive treadmill training with virtual obstacles (TT + VR). Outcome measures included gait under usual-walking and dual-task conditions and while negotiating physical obstacles. Cognitive function and functional performance were also assessed. RESULTS: Patients were 67.1 \u00b1 6.5 years and had a mean disease duration of 9.8 \u00b1 5.6 years. Posttraining, gait speed significantly improved during usual walking, during dual task, and while negotiating overground obstacles.

METHODS: Incidence was defined as first occurrence of a major coronary event, i.e. the sum of first CHD hospital admissions and out-of-hospital CHD deaths without a hospital admission for CHD in the preceding five years. Mortality was defined as the sum of deaths coded to CHD and deaths coded to related causes but with prior hospitalisation for CHD (in the preceding five years). Data were sourced from the New Zealand Health Information Service and record linkage was carried out using a unique national identifier, the National Health Index (NHI). Given estimates for incidence and mortality, multi-state lifetables were built and estimates for prevalence, survival, lifetable risk, and median age at onset extracted. RESULTS: Estimated prevalence of CHD increased exponentially from around 2% for males and 0.5% for females at age 40-44 to peak at around 18% and 12% respectively at age 85-89. Median age at onset of CHD was 67.5 years for males and 77.5 years for females. Median survival duration was 9.5 years for males and 6.2 years for females.

Median follow-up from ASCT was 37.2 months. One- and three-year overall survival (OS) rates were 90.3% and 74.5%, progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 85% and 59%, respectively. Three-year OS and PFS rates in the non-TBI group versus TBI group were similar: 80% versus 72.5% and 60% versus 57%, respectively. In univariate analysis, the use of TBI did not modify OS or PFS (P=0.93 and P=0.48, respectively). This remains true for patients who underwent ASCT up front. According to multivariate analysis, OS tended to be shorter for patients presenting with high Mantle Cell Lymphoma International Prognostic Index or low hemoglobin level.",
        "output": "No, ASCT with TBI is not necessarily superior to ASCT without TBI in mantle cell lymphoma patients. The results of this study suggest that the use of TBI in ASCT does not improve the outcome of mantle cell lymphoma patients."

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: Gaps in health insurance coverage compromise access to health care services, but it is unclear whether the length of time without coverage is an important factor. This article examines how coverage gaps of different lengths affect access to health care among low-income children. METHODS: We conducted a multivariable, cross-sectional analysis of statewide primary data from families in Oregon's food stamp population with children presumed eligible for publicly funded health insurance. The key independent variable was length of a child's insurance coverage gap; outcome variables were 6 measures of health care access. RESULTS: More than 25% of children reported a coverage gap during the 12-month study period. Children most likely to have a gap were older, Hispanic, lived in households earning between 133% and 185% of the federal poverty level, and/or had an employed parent. After adjusting for these characteristics, in comparison with continuously insured children, a child with a gap of any length had a higher likelihood of unmet medical, prescription, and dental needs; no usual source of care; no doctor visits in the past year; and delayed urgent care. When comparing coverage gaps, children without coverage for longer than 6 months had a higher likelihood of unmet needs compared with children with a gap shorter than 6 months. In some cases, children with gaps longer than 6 months were similar to, or worse off than, children who had never been insured.",
        "output": "Yes, the length of a child's coverage gap is an important factor in determining their access to health care. Children who have gaps in coverage of any length are more likely to have unmet medical, prescription, and dental needs, as well as no usual source of care, no doctor visits in the past year, and delayed urgent care. Children with gaps longer than 6 months are more likely to have worse outcomes than those with shorter gaps."

However, the co-existence of NF1 with the full spectrum of MEN 2A has rarely been reported. The aim of the study was to investigate the presence of secondary neoplasias in a patient with diagnosed NF1, and in particular the presence of hyperparathyroidism and the possible co-existence with another pheochromocytoma-related syndrome. METHODS: We report a case of a 70 years old female patient who had NF1. The patient was referred to our center and was diagnosed with an isolated pheochromocytoma of the right adrenal gland for which she underwent right adrenalectomy. We further investigated for the presence of another pheochromocytoma-related syndrome and in particular for the presence of hyperparathyroidism and medullary thyroid cancer. Molecular screening for germline mutations of the genes NF1, RET and VHL has also been performed. RESULTS: The patient was further diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism and medullary thyroid cancer, having the full spectrum of the clinical picture of the MEN2A syndrome. The genetic testing revealed the germline mutation for NF1 but not for the RET proto-oncogene which is generally found in MEN2A cases.",

The human HINT1 gene is located on chromosome 5q31.2, a region implicated in linkage studies of schizophrenia. HINT1 had been shown to have different expression in postmortem brains between schizophrenia patients and unaffected controls. It was also found to be associated with the dysregulation of postsynaptic dopamine transmission, thus suggesting a potential role in several neuropsychiatric diseases. METHODS: : In this work, we studied 8 SNPs around the HINT1 gene region using the Irish study of high density schizophrenia families (ISHDSF, 1350 subjects and 273 pedigrees) and the Irish case control study of schizophrenia (ICCSS, 655 affected subjects and 626 controls). The expression level of HINT1 was compared between the postmortem brain cDNAs from schizophrenic patients and unaffected controls provided by the Stanley Medical Research Institute. RESULTS: : We found nominally significant differences in allele frequencies in several SNPs for both ISHDSF and ICCSS samples in sex-stratified analyses. However, the sex effect differed between the two samples. In expression studies, no significant difference in expression was observed between patients and controls.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chest CT scans of 2633 participants (mean age 59.2 years; 50% female) of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) were visually evaluated for the presence of pulmonary cysts and their image characteristics. These findings were correlated with participant demographics and results of pulmonary function tests as well as the presence of emphysema independently detected on CT. The interval change was investigated by comparison with previous CT scans (median interval 6.1 years). RESULTS: Pulmonary cysts were seen in 7.6% (95% CI 6.6% to 8.7%; 200/2633). They were not observed in participants younger than 40 years old, and the prevalence increased with age. Multiple cysts (at least five) were seen in 0.9% of all participants. Participants with pulmonary cysts showed significantly lower body mass index (BMI) (p<0.001). Pulmonary cysts were most likely to appear solitary in the peripheral area of the lower lobes and remain unchanged or slightly increase in size over time. Pulmonary cysts showed no significant influence on pulmonary functions (p=0.07-0.6) except for diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) (p=0.03) and no association with cigarette smoking (p=0.1-0.9) or emphysema (p=0.7).",

METHODS: Both pediatric and adult patients were studied in two groups: those with a straight or nearly straight septum (n = 25 and 124, respectively) and those with deviation (n = 64 and 129, respectively). The cross-sectional area (CSA) of the IT bone and soft tissue were measured at anterior, middle, and posterior thirds of the IT in coronal CT sections. The ratio of CSA of the IT bone and soft tissue on two sides of the septum (interturbinate ratio [IR]) were calculated. IRs were then compared among straight septum and deviation groups for both the pediatric and the adult groups. RESULTS: IR of the bony concha CSA for the deviation group was significantly higher compared with the straight septum group in anterior, middle, and posterior segments in adults (p = 0.028, 0.018, and<0.001, respectively; independent samples t-test). The soft tissue component hypertrophy was prominent only in the middle segment (p = 0.15); however, there was no significant difference for pediatric patients.

However, cervical lengths have not been formally compared between women with prolapse and those with normal support. METHODS: Cervix and uterine corpus lengths were measured on magnetic resonance images in a case-control study of 51 women with prolapse and 46 women with normal support determined by the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) examination. Group matching ensured similar demographics in both groups. Ranges for normal cervical lengths were determined from the values in the control group in order to evaluate for cervical elongation amongst women with prolapse. RESULTS: The cervix is 36.4 % (8.6 mm) longer in women with prolapse than in women with normal pelvic support (p<0.001). Linear regression modeling suggests the feature most highly associated with cervical length is the degree of uterine descent (POP-Q point C). Approximately 40 % of women with prolapse have cervical elongation; 57 % of cervical elongation in prolapse can be explained by a logistic regression-based model including POP-Q point C, body mass index, and menopausal status.",

The antrum and frontal sinus were each punctured by two catheters and irrigated with air at constant flow. Nitric oxide output and its rate of accumulation in the absence of air flow were measured in each sinus and in the adjacent nasal cavity. RESULTS: Prior to ostial occlusion, NO output in the nose was 96 nL/min. It decreased by 12% after blockage of all of the ostia. In the isolated sinuses, it was 190 nL/min (antrum) and 68 nL/min (frontal).

The overlap of these symptoms often results in physicians ordering unnecessary LE Doppler ultrasounds in patients with LE cellulitis. This practice leads to subjecting patients to unwarranted procedures and results in increased healthcare costs. We aimed to determine the percentage of Doppler ultrasounds performed in patients admitted with LE cellulitis and the prevalence of DVT in that population. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of the patients admitted January 1, 2009 to June 30, 2013 who had a diagnosis of LE cellulitis. The number of Doppler ultrasounds performed and the presence of DVT was recorded. Patients were divided into groups of Doppler ultrasounds with no DVT and Doppler ultrasounds that were positive for DVT to compare the risk factors. RESULTS: There were 624 patients identified using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision code for LE cellulitis at the time of admission. Slightly more than half of the subjects were men (315/624) and the average age was 61.4 \u00b1 18.8 years (mean \u00b1 standard deviation). There were 417 (66.8%) patients who underwent Doppler ultrasound. Only 25 (5.9%) patients had DVT.

The imaging protocol consisted of: multislice turbo spin echo (TSE) T2w, sequential-slice fast imaging with steady precession (FISP), a time-reversed version of FISP (PSIF), and FISP with balanced gradients in all spatial directions (True-FISP) sequences. Vessel conspicuity was rated and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was calculated for each sequence and a differential receiver operating characteristic was performed. RESULTS: Liver findings were detected in 96% using the TSE sequence. PSIF, FISP, and True-FISP imaging showed lesions in 91%, 61%, and 65%, respectively. The TSE sequence offered the best CNR, followed by PSIF imaging. Differential receiver operating characteristic analysis also rated TSE and PSIF to be the superior sequences. Lesions in the head and neck were detected in all cases by TSE and FISP, in 92% using True-FISP, and in 84% using PSIF. True-FISP offered the best CNR, followed by TSE imaging.

Our aim was to evaluate the incidence of contamination of liquids during catheter-based neuroangiographic examinations, the spectrum of microorganisms, a comparison of two different trolley-settings, and a follow-up of all patients with regard to clinical and lab signs of infection. METHODS: A total of 170 patients underwent either diagnostic angiography (n\u2009=\u2009111) or arterial neuroendovascular procedures (n\u2009=\u200959). To study the impact of airborne contamination of sterile liquids, we randomly assigned equal numbers of procedures to two distinct setups. Group A with standard open-surface bowls and group B with repetitive coverage of liquids throughout the procedure. Patient preparation was performed with utmost care. After each procedure, samples of the liquids were sent for microbiological evaluation. Patients were followed for signs of infection (fever, white blood cell count, C-reactive-protein). RESULTS: Of all samples, 25.3\u2009% were contaminated. Contamination consisted of resident skin microbiota only and was more common with procedures (28.8\u2009%) than with diagnostic angiography (23.4\u2009%) and less common in uncovered (23.5\u2009%) than in covered bowls (27.1\u2009%).

The participants with peptic ulcer disease or non-ulcer dyspepsia non-responding to other medications who were also H pylori-positive patients either with positive rapid urease test (RUT) or positive histology were included. All groups were pretreated with omeprazole for 2 d and then treated with quadruple therapy regimen (omeprazole, bismuth, tetracycline and metronidazole); all drugs were given twice daily. Groups 1 and 2 were treated for 3 d, groups 3, 4 and 5 for 7 d, and group 6 for 14 d. Groups 1 to 4 received sugar in the form of 10% sucrose syrup. Levodopa was prescribed for groups 1 and 3. Patients in groups 2 and 4 were given placebo for levodopa and groups 5 and 6 received placebos for both sugar and levodopa. Upper endoscopy and biopsies were carried out before treatment and two months after treatment. Eradication of H pylori was assessed by RUT and histology 8 wk later.

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: Our hypothesis is that the adoption of Department of Health (DH) guidance has led to an improvement in outcome in gynaecological cancer survival. SETTING: In 1999 the DH in England introduced the Improving Outcomes in Gynaecological Cancer guidance, advising case management by multidisciplinary teams with surgical concentration in specialist hospitals. This guidance was rapidly adopted in the East of England, with a population of 2.5 million. POPULATION: The population of the Anglia Cancer Network was approximately 2.3 million. METHODS: From 1996 to 2003, details of 3406 cases of gynaecological cancer were identified in the Anglia region of England. Survival analysis was performed by Cox proportional hazards regression, relative to cases diagnosed in 1996. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Primary endpoint was survival. RESULTS: The survival rates for cases diagnosed between 1996 and 1999 were broadly the same across the time period, with a marked improvement taking place in 2000, and continuing to 2003 (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.64-0.79, comparing 2000-03 with 1996-99 diagnoses), for all gynaecological sites combined. Adjustment for treatments or method of case follow-up did not attenuate these improvements. There was a concurrent change towards major surgery being performed in specialist centres from 2000.",

These patients are at an increased risk of developing bladder malignancies. METHODS: A questionnaire was mailed to all SCI centers in these countries. The number of patients with SCI treated between 1995 and 1999, and the data of all patients with SCI with bladder cancer were recorded. RESULTS: The charts of 43,561 patients were reviewed. Of these, 48 patients (0.11%) developed bladder cancer. The data of 8 female and 29 male patients were fully available. The mean age was 53.3 years. Bladder management was reflex voiding in 18 patients, intermittent catheterization in 12 patients, and an indwelling catheter in 7 patients. Twelve patients were smokers. The mean time between SCI and the first bladder cancer diagnosis was 22.6 years. Thirty-two percent had superficial cancers, 8% had carcinoma in situ, and 60% presented with muscle-infiltrating tumors; 81% had urothelial cancer and 19% squamous cell cancer.

METHODS: A total of 57 consecutive patients who underwent video-assisted thoracic surgery for secondary spontaneous pneumothorax was retrospectively analyzed. Of these patients, 15 underwent surgery under epidural and/or local anesthesia (ELA) and 42 under general anesthesia. Using propensity score matching, we identified comparable patient groups: the ELA group and general anesthesia group (n\u00a0=\u00a08 each). We compared the duration of operating room stay, operating time, postoperative hematologic data on postoperative day 1, postoperative complications, duration of hospital stay, and the incidence of hospital death between the ELA and general anesthesia groups. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, the duration of operating room stay was significantly shorter in the ELA group (P\u00a0=\u00a0.006).

The aim of this study was the correlation of perioperative ischemic complications and vascular calcifications of patients undergoing TKA. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, all 825 patients who had undergone primary TKA in the period 2009-2011 with intraoperative use of a tourniquet were included. Patients with pathologic pulse status and history of vascular intervention were excluded. Vascular calcifications seen on the preoperative radiograph were classified as intimal-type and medial-type calcifications and were correlated to perioperative ischemic complications. RESULTS: Vascular calcifications were seen in 268 patients (medial type: n\u00a0= 54, intimal type: n\u00a0= 214). Major ischemic complications such as arterial thrombosis were seen in 2 patients, one of them with intimal-type calcifications and one without (complication rate 0.5% vs 0.2%, P\u00a0= .715). The rate of minor ischemic complications such as protracted wound healing was significantly elevated in patients with intimal-type calcifications (6.1%) when compared to patients with medial-type calcifications (1.9%) and those without (1.6%, P\u00a0= .003) even when multiple regression analysis was performed taking into account 2 potential influencing factors \"age\" and \"diabetes mellitus\" (P\u00a0= .008).",

The DNA was investigated for mutations in the HFE gene when one of these iron parameters was elevated. RESULTS: For 19 out of 88 patients with CFS an elevated TS was found. A new blood sample was obtained from 11 of these 19: six had increased TS and two had elevated serum ferritin values. These eight patients were neither C282Y homozygotes nor compound C282Y-H63D heterozygotes.

Respondents were classified based on whether they consistently chose either the low or high variance plan. Logistic regression models were estimated to examine the relationship between decision outcomes and task characteristics. RESULTS: The majority of respondents consistently chose either the low or high variance plan, consistent with expected utility theory. Half of respondents consistently chose the low variance plan. Respondents were less likely to make discrepant choices when information was presented in graphical format.",

        "input": "INTRODUCTION: The benefits of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) remain controversial. Patient selection is important to identify those who will benefit from PEG. This study aims to identify patient factors that may help in patient selection for PEG. METHODS: Patients who underwent PEG at the Gastroenterology Unit of Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore, from January 1998 to December 1999, were identified. Multiple logistic regression was used to predict patient's outcomes. RESULTS: There were 106 (61 male) patients with a mean follow-up period of 465 days (range 3-1,410 days). The mean patient age was 64.5 years (range 17-94 years). The 30-day, six-month, one-year and two-year mortality rates were 7.5 percent, 26.4 percent, 35.8 percent and 46.2 percent, respectively. Older age (p-value is 0.023), presence of bedsores (p-value is 0.042) and abnormal nutritional status based on body mass index less than 20 kg/square metres (p-value is 0.001) were predictive of mortality. 26 percent of patients were able to wean off PEG in an average period of 185 days (range 3-870 days). Patients were generally younger (p-value is 0.003) and had better renal function (p-value is 0.047).",

METHODS: During a tailored multidisciplinary treatment for fibromyalgia, validated self-report questionnaires were assessed at baseline and posttreatment on the outcome measures of pain, functional disability, fatigue, anxiety, and negative mood. In addition, the participants were asked to fill in a questionnaire at the end of the treatment assessing the patient's perception of improvement on core outcomes, as well as satisfaction and usefulness of the treatment. RESULTS: Moderate to relatively high correlations were found between the patient's perception of improvement and pre-post changes on the physical outcomes, in contrast to small or nonsignificant correlations for psychological outcomes. In addition, satisfaction and usefulness were significantly related to pre-post changes on physical outcomes, but no relationship was found with respect to psychological outcomes.",

        "input": "PURPOSE: To investigate in vitro if P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transport can differentiate between antibiotic drugs exhibiting increased active renal clearance (CL(r)) in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients (i.e., dicloxacillin, trimethoprim) and drugs that do not exhibit this phenomenon (i.e.. cefsulodin, sulfamethoxazole). METHODS: Transport studies were carried out in MDCK (wild type) and MDR1-MDCK (P-gp overexpressing) cells that were grown to confluence on Transwell inserts. [14C]-mannitol transport and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) were measured to validate the integrity of the cells. Drug concentrations were analyzed using HPLC. RESULTS: Dicloxacillin and trimethoprim are substrates of P-gp (B-->A/A-->B ratios in MDR1-MDCK cells are 32 and 50, respectively). P-gp inhibitors (i.e., GG918, cyclosporine, ketoconazole, vinblastine) decreased the B-->A transport of dicloxacillin and trimethoprim and increased the A-->B transport of trimethoprim while non-P-gp inhibitors (e.g., PAH) had no effect. In contrast, cefsulodin and sulfamethoxazole are not substrates of P-gp (B-->sA/A-->B values in MDCK and MDR1-MDCK cells are -1).",
        "output": "Yes, the enhanced renal clearance of antibiotics in cystic fibrosis patients can be explained by P-glycoprotein transport. P-glycoprotein is an ATP-binding cassette transporter that is expressed at high levels in the epithelial cells of the kidney and is responsible for the active transport of certain drugs out of the cells. Drugs that are substrates of P-glycoprotein, such as dicloxacillin and trimethoprim, are cleared more quickly from the kidneys of cystic fibrosis patients due to the increased expression and activity of the transporter. Conversely, drugs that are not substrates of P-glycoprotein, such as cefsulodin and sulfamethoxazole, are not cleared more quickly."

We aimed to describe current practices regarding third trimester ultrasound in our centre and to evaluate the feasibility of a randomized trial. METHODS: All women with a singleton pregnancy managed from the beginning of pregnancy in our maternity unit who delivered after 28 weeks (N = 335) were assessed prospectively over a 50-day period. Details of maternal characteristics, medical and obstetrical history, management of pregnancy and delivery, ultrasound practices, and results were recorded. One hundred women had a brief personal interview to define their expectations and experience of third trimester ultrasound. RESULTS: The women who were assessed had 2.9 +/- 1.2 ultrasound scans during their pregnancy. All had a second trimester ultrasound scan and 53.7% had a third trimester scan. There was no medical indication for the third trimester ultrasound scan in 12.8% of the women. Among women with a low-risk pregnancy, 40% had a third trimester ultrasound, and 21.6% of those were done without medical indication. Among women with a low-risk pregnancy who had a third trimester ultrasound, the interview disclosed that 80% found that the test was not stressful.

Presently, it is unknown whether GPs adhere to these guidelines and target antibiotic treatment more often at patients with risk-elevating conditions. OBJECTIVES: We assessed whether in elderly primary care patients with acute bronchitis or exacerbations of chronic pulmonary disease (COPD), antibiotics are more often prescribed to patients with risk-elevating co-morbid conditions. METHODS: Using the Utrecht GP research database, we analysed 2643 episodes in patients of 65 years of age or older with a GP-diagnosed acute bronchitis or exacerbation of COPD. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was applied to determine independent determinants of antibiotic use. RESULTS: Antibiotic prescribing rates were high in both acute bronchitis (84%) and in exacerbations of COPD (53%). In acute bronchitis, only age was an independent determinant of antibiotic use [odds ratio (OR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.003-1.048], whereas in exacerbations of COPD antibiotics were more often prescribed to male patients (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.5), patients with diabetes (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.4) and heart failure (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.7).",

EKD1 has an overlap with the locus of the \"Infantile Convulsion and Choreoathetosis (ICCA) syndrome\". The favorable natural history, the episodic nature of the symptoms and their sensitivity to anticonvulsant therapy suggest channelopathy as a mechanism of PKD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the clinical features, the family history, the treatment response, the evolution and the technical investigations in 19 affected individuals. RESULTS: All cases were idiopathic. Ten patients had a positive familial history. Three patients suffered from ICCA syndrome.

We hypothesized that PV firing (PV-F) should continue after circumferential PV isolation (CPVI) because the PV tissue responsible for PV-F remains intact. METHODS AND RESULTS: In Group-1 (n = 92), isoproterenol (ISP) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were co-administered to provoke PV-F before and after CPVI. The site of rapid focal discharge that initiated atrial fibrillation (AF) defined PV-F versus non-PV-F. Additional 17 patients with PV-F induced by ISP+ATP before CPVI were enrolled into Group-2 and various pacing maneuvers were used in conjunction to ISP+ATP to provoke PV-F after CPVI. In Group-1, AF was induced in 47/81 (58.0%) and 16/88 (18.2%) patients before and after CPVI, respectively (P<0.01). Before CPVI, 43/47 (91.5%) of the rapid firing originated from PV.

METHODS: Trauma patients were screened using a statewide registry during a 5-year period (January 2001 to December 2005). Burn patients, transfer patients, permanent tracheostomies, and patients who underwent multiple surgical airways were excluded from the study. Data were collected on patient demographics, Trauma and Injury Severity Score, days to tracheostomy, mortality, ICU LOS, total ventilator days, pneumonia, and hospital LOS. STATISTICAL ANALYSES: log-linear modeling, chi2, p<0.05. RESULTS: A total of 125,533 trauma patients were analyzed. Out of these, 82,148 patients met inclusion criteria and had complete data for analysis. There were 6,880 patients intubated at the scene, during transport, or at admission to the emergency department, with 685 receiving a temporary tracheostomy. There was a significantly higher mortality rate (48.9%) associated with patients with low Ps (<0.25) receiving early tracheostomy (ET),<4 days.

METHODS: Using voxel-based morphometry, we correlated contralesional gross manual dexterity assessed by the box and block test and whole-brain gray and white-matter volume changes on high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging in 37 7-year-old post-neonatal arterial ischemic stroke children. We also compared the volume of the identified structures with magnetic resonance imaging data of 10 typically developing age-matched children. RESULTS: Areas showing the highest positive correlation with the box and block test scores were ipsilesional mediodorsal thalamus, contralesional cerebellar lobule VIIa Crus I, and ipsilesional corticospinal tract at the level of superior corona radiata, the posterior limb of the internal capsule, and the cerebral peduncle and the ipsilesional body of corpus callosum. When compared with typically developing age-matched children, post-neonatal arterial ischemic stroke children with severe contralesional hand motor deficit exhibited significant volume reductions in these structures (except the cerebellum), whereas no differences were found with those with good manual dexterity.

        "input": "PURPOSE: Interaction and subgroup analyses remain controversial topics in epidemiology. A recent theoretical paper suggested that a combination of no overall treatment-outcome association and treatment effect limited to a single subgroup would imply a clinically implausible interaction, with opposite treatment effects in the two subgroups. However, this argument was based entirely on point estimates and ignored sampling error and statistical inference. METHODS: We simulated hypothetical studies in which treatment truly affected the outcome in only one subgroup, with no effect in the other subgroup. We generated 1000 random samples for three study designs (small clinical study, case-control, and large cohort), and different values of total sample size (N), relative size of the affected subgroup, and treatment effect. We estimated the frequency of significant results for tests of overall and subgroup-specific treatment effects, and treatment-by-subgroup interaction. RESULTS: Combination of statistically non-significant overall treatment effect and significant treatment-by-subgroup interaction occurred frequently, especially if the affected subgroup was proportionally smaller, even in studies with high power to detect the overall effect (e.g. in 37.1% of samples with N\u2009=\u200920\u2009000, with 600 outcomes, and an effect (odds ratio of 1.5) limited to 30% of subjects). Furthermore, in most samples with a significant interaction, subgroup analyses correctly indicated that the significant effect was limited to one subgroup.",
        "output": "The argument that a combination of no overall treatment effect and a significant treatment-by-subgroup interaction implies a clinically implausible interaction is not valid. This is because the argument is based on point estimates and ignores sampling error and statistical inference. In our simulations, we found that this argument was invalid even when the affected subgroup was proportionally smaller, and the overall effect was statistically significant. Furthermore, in most samples with a significant interaction, subgroup analyses correctly indicated that the significant effect was limited to one subgroup."

SETTING: Ten Canadian university based crash investigation centres. SUBJECTS: 470 children aged 4-14 years, with 168 selected for detailed analysis, and 1301 adults. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Use of seat belts by vehicle occupants; severity of injury adjusted for age and crash severity. RESULTS: Overall, 40% (189/470) of children were unbelted. Of the 335 children in cars driven by belted adults, 73 (22%) were unbelted. The odds of sustaining fatal or moderately severe injury (injury severity score>or =4) for children in the front passenger seat was more than nine times higher for unbelted children than for belted ones (odds ratio 9.8 (95% confidence interval 2.4 to 39.4)) and for those in the rear left seat was more than two times higher for unbelted than for belted children (2.6 (1.1 to 5.9)). The protection afforded by seat belts compared favourably with the results for adults in the same seat positions (odds ratios for unbelted v belted adults of 2.4 and 2.7 for front and rear seat passengers respectively).",

Despite that considerable amount of scoliosis patients have shown interest in obtaining scoliosis information through Internet, previous studies have demonstrated poor quality of online information. However, this conclusion may vary depending on region and culture. Since China has a restricted Internet access outside of its borders, the aim of this study is to evaluate the quality of scoliosis information available online using recognized scoring systems and to analyze the Internet as a source of health information in China. METHODS: A survey-based questionnaire was distributed to 280 respondents at outpatient clinics. Information on demographics and Internet use was collected. Binary logistic analysis was performed to identify possible predictors for the use of Internet. In addition, the top 60 scoliosis related websites assessed through 4 search engines were reviewed by a surgeon and the quality of online information was evaluated using DISCERN score and JAMA benchmark. RESULTS: Use of the Internet as a source for scoliosis related information was confirmed in 87.8% of the respondents. College education, Internet access at home and urban residence were identified as potential predictors for Internet use. However, the quality of online scoliosis related information was poor with an average DISCERN score of 27.9\u00b111.7 and may be misleading for scoliosis patients.",

Diabetes represents one of the risk factors that increase the chances of prosthetic infections because of related severe peripheral vascular disease. Vasodilatation can be a therapeutic option to overcome diabetic vascular damages and increase the local blood supply. In this study, the effect of a PGE\u2081 vasodilator on the incidence of surgical infections in diabetic mice was investigated. METHODOLOGY: A S. aureus implant-related infection was induced in femurs of diabetic mice, then differently treated with a third generation cephalosporin alone or associated with a PGE\u2081 vasodilator. Variations in mouse body weight were evaluated as index of animal welfare. The femurs were harvested after 28 days and underwent both qualitative and quantitative analysis as micro-CT, histological and microbiological analyses. RESULTS: The analysis performed in this study demonstrated the increased host response to implant-related infection in diabetic mice treated with the combination of a PGE\u2081 and antibiotic. In this group, restrained signs of infections were identified by micro-CT and histological analysis. On the other hand, the diabetic mice treated with the antibiotic alone showed a severe infection and inability to successfully respond to the standard antimicrobial treatment.",

To date, almost no studies have examined ADHD in unbiased community-based studies, ascertaining both the prevalence of the diagnosis within nonreferred populations and the extent to which various treatments (i.e., stimulant medication, mental health treatments, and educational interventions) are used. METHOD: As a part of the Methods for the Epidemiology of Child and Adolescent Mental Disorders (MECA) Study, the authors examined epidemiological survey data obtained from 1,285 children and their parents across 4 U.S. communities. Analyses examined the frequency of children's ADHD diagnosis, the extent to which medications were prescribed, as well as the provision of other services (e.g., psychosocial treatments, school-based educational interventions). RESULTS: Findings indicated that 5.1% of children met full DSM-III-RADHD criteria across the pooled sample. Only 12.5% of children meeting ADHD criteria had been treated with stimulants during the previous 12 months. Some children who had been prescribed stimulants did not meet full ADHD diagnostic criteria, but these children manifested high levels of ADHD symptoms, suggesting that the medication had been appropriately prescribed. Children with ADHD were generally more likely to receive mental health counseling and/or school-based interventions than medication.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Thrombocytopaenia is the most frequent malaria-associated haematologic alteration observed with all five Plasmodium parasites causing disease in humans. Although not included in the World Health Organization criteria for severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria, severe thrombocytopaenia has been increasingly mentioned as an indicator of P. vivax malaria severity. CASE: Here, it is described a case of imported P. vivax malaria in a 37-year old man from Pakistan who presented with severe thrombocytopaenia (5 \u00d7 10(9)/L). He was admitted to the intensive care unit and initially treated with a 1-day course of intravenous quinine followed by oral chloroquine and primaquine. The patient's platelet count increased as early as 4 hours after treatment inception and the clinical course was favourable and uneventful. DISCUSSION: This case report, along with a review of published cases focusing on the relationship between thrombocytopaenia and severe P. vivax malaria, suggests that the prognostic role of severe thrombocytopaenia is ambiguous in absence of severe haemorraghic complications and its use as diagnostic criterion of malaria severity may lead to overestimation of severe P. vivax malaria cases.",

RESULTS: The response rate was 82%. The prevalence of asthma was 5.6%. There was no difference neither between the two age groups nor between sexes. In contrast, there was a significant difference in prevalence according to whether the child lived in a town (7.3%) or in the countryside (4.6%) (p = 0.01). In the department of the Puy-de-D\u00f4me, this difference was even more distinct, with a prevalence of 10% in urban areas and 4.0% in the countryside (p = 0.001). Twelve percent of the children had experienced wheezing over the previous 12 months.

SUBJECTS: The authors studied 91,633 adult patients admitted to 116 acute care hospitals in Quebec, Canada, with a primary diagnosis of AMI between 1992 and 1999. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Hospital performance ranks, based on 30-day AMI mortality rates, were estimated with hierarchical models and compared using 3 different methods for handling transferred patients (exclude all transfers; include transfers and assign outcome to the referring hospital; include transfers and assign outcome to the receiving hospital). The explanatory variable of interest was the hospital to which the patient's outcome was attributed. RESULTS: Using the 3 methods, 4 hospitals were ranked \"best performers\" once, and 1 hospital ranked among the best in 2 of the 3 analyses performed. Nine hospitals were ranked \"worst performers\" at least once (4 of which ranked among the \"worst\" once only, 2 ranked among the \"worst\" twice, and 3 were consistently ranked \"worst performers\" in all analyses). There was significant variation in mortality rates among hospitals, and the difference in the rates between the highest and lowest ranking hospitals exceeded the clinically relevant benchmark of 1%.",
        "output": "The results of this study suggest that the exclusion of transferred patients from hospital performance rankings may lead to an overestimation of the true quality of care at some hospitals. This is particularly true for hospitals with a high number of transferred patients. Therefore, it is important to consider the impact of transferred patients when evaluating hospital performance."

The aims of this study were to determine whether h-indices were associated with greater National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding success among academic radiologists. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the Scopus database, h-indices were calculated for a random sample of academic radiologists with the rank of professor. Using the NIH tool Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools Expenditures and Reports, we determined the number, classification, and total years of NIH grant funding as principal investigator for each radiologist. Differences in h-index, sorted by funding status, were determined using Wilcoxon's tests. Associations between h-index and funding status were determined using logistic regression. Significant correlations between h-index and grant metrics were determined using Spearman's \u03c1. RESULTS: Among 210 professors of radiology, 48 (23%) secured at least one NIH grant. The mean h-index was significantly higher among individuals who secured at least one NIH grant (19.1) compared to those who did not (10.4) (P<.0001). Professors with h-indices<10 compared to those with h-indices>10 were significantly less likely to receive NIH funding (odds ratio, 0.07; P = .0321). However, h-indices>10 were not significantly predictive of greater funding. No significant relationships were observed between h-index and the number of grant awards, years of prior funding, the amounts of grant awards, or grant classification.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: Among 185 patients undergoing PVI, 52 reported no significant improvement in their clinical course. We analyzed PV conduction in 51 PVs (15 patients) at repeat PVI. All PVs were isolated with either RF (30 W, 50 degrees C, 60 seconds) or cryoablation (-80 degrees C for 5 minutes). At repeat study, 42 of the previously isolated 51 PVs had return of conduction. All patients had recurrent conduction in>or =2 PVs, with only 1 non-PV focus identified. The mean number of RF applications required to re-isolate the PVs was fewer at the repeat compared with the initial procedure (10+/-6 versus 4+/-2, P<0.005). Over a period of 15+/-6 months, all but 1 patient was clinically improved by the second procedure.",

We also investigated how losses from immunization by vaccination imposed by the resistant strain affect the spread of the disease. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We designed and analyzed a deterministic compartment model illustrating transmission of vaccine-sensitive and vaccine-resistant strains during a vaccination program. We investigated how the loss of protection effectiveness impacts the program. Results show that a vaccination to prevent the spread of disease can instead spread the disease when the resistant strain is less virulent than the sensitive strain. If the loss is high, the program does not prevent the spread of the resistant strain despite a large prevalence rate of the program. The epidemic's final size can be larger than that before the vaccination program. We propose how to use poor vaccines, which have a large loss, to maximize program effects and describe various program risks, which can be estimated using available epidemiological data.",

The frequency of exclusively proximal localization in first-, second- and third-generation metachronous adenomas was compared with that of synchronous adenomas. RESULTS: A total of 54.5% of patients with CRC had synchronous adenomas. After a median follow-up of 48 months, with 2.74+/-1.47 colonoscopies/case, 42.4% developed metachronous adenomas, 16.8% second-generation adenomas and 7.3% third-generation lesions. Proximal shift was found in metachronous adenomas in both sexes, independently of tumoral size and the number of initial lesions. The frequency of exclusively proximal localization in adenomas was 21.2% in synchronous lesions, 39.5% in first-generation metachronous adenomas (p=0.0001; OR=2.46 [1.50-3.95]), 42.6% in second-generation metachronous adenomas (p=0.0008; OR=2.77 [1.44-5.31]) and 39.3% in third-generation metachronous lesions (p=0.0003; OR=2.41 [0.97-5.93]).",
        "output": "Yes, metachronous colorectal adenomas show a proximal shift, with an increasing frequency of proximal localization in successive generations of metachronous adenomas."

This study identifies lessons learned from the Medicaid Extension Demonstration, which was authorized by Congress to experiment with innovative approaches to providing health care coverage for low-income children. The three programs compare and contrast a variety of features that may enhance or detract from access, including a traditional Medicaid expansion, a private indemnity model, and a comprehensive managed care delivery system. METHODOLOGY: Two waves of telephone surveys were conducted with a sample of parents of children participating in the Medicaid Extension Demonstration, and a comparison group of parents of children who were eligible but not participating. Descriptive and multivariate analyses were conducted to determine the impact of the demonstration on access to care. RESULTS: Compared with those who were uninsured, children in the managed care program were more likely to have a medical home and a physician visit and were less likely to have an emergency room visit, and had lower levels of unmet need.

The goals of the current study were to characterize further the relation of histologic-specific ovarian cancer risks to reproductive and lifestyle attributes. METHODS: The authors conducted a pooled analysis of 10 case-control studies of ovarian cancer in US White women, involving 1834 patients with invasive epithelial ovarian cancer (1067 serous, 254 mucinous, 373 endometrioid, and 140 clear cell) and 7484 control women. RESULTS: Risks of all four histological types were inversely associated with parity and oral contraceptive use, but the histologic types showed different associations with nonreproductive factors. Unique associations include an inverse relation of serous cancer risk to body mass index, a positive relation of mucinous cancer risk to cigarette smoking, and a weakly positive relation of endometrioid cancer risk to body mass index. Risk of all histologic types was unassociated with age at menarche, age at menopause, a history of infertility, noncontraceptive estrogen use, and alcohol consumption.",

METHODS: The APC flow was directly measured in 32 patients undergoing Fontan procedures from July 1997 to September 2000. The APC flow was measured in the operating room during total cardiopulmonary bypass, and was expressed as a percentage of total bypass pump flow. RESULTS: The APC flow ranged from 9% to 49% of total pump flow (median, 18%). Higher preoperative systemic oxygen saturation, pulmonary artery oxygen saturation, pulmonary to systemic flow ratio, and angiographic APC grade correlated with higher APC flow. There were no operative deaths; there was one Fontan takedown (APC flow = 14%). The APC flow had no significant effects on postoperative Fontan pressure, common atrial pressure, transpulmonary gradient, duration of effusions, or resource utilization after the Fontan procedures.",

METHODS: An Australian community sample comprising 406 postnatal women responded to the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS), the Maternal Attitudes Questionnaire (MAQ), the Vulnerable Personality Style Questionnaire (VPSQ) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). They also responded to several questions related to perinatal and postnatal experiences. RESULTS: Path analysis demonstrated that different mediational pathways operated for different risk factors. The relationship between having a difficult baby and postnatal depression was fully mediated by maternal-specific dysfunctional cognitions (MAQ scores), whereas the relationship between past history of depression and postnatal depression was partially mediated by general dysfunctional cognitions (DAS scores). Finally, the relationship between a vulnerable personality and depressive symptomatology was mediated by both DAS and MAQ scores. LIMITATIONS: The study employed a correlational design. Thus, all inferences regarding possible causal pathways are tentative. In addition, the generalisability of these findings to other populations needs to be demonstrated in future research.",

Therefore, correction of IR is a relevant therapeutic target.We performed the current trial to evaluate whether 12- month metformin therapy improves vascular stiffness in patients with NAFLD and to assess if this improvement is associated with change in glucose control, insulin resistance or circulating adiponectin. METHODS: In randomized, placebo controlled study, 63 patients with NAFLD were assigned to one of two groups: Group 1 received daily metformin; Group 2 received placebo. Central aortic augmentation index (AI) was performed using SphygmoCor (version 7.1, AtCor Medical, Sydney, Australia) at baseline, at 4-and 12-month treatment period. Metabolic parameters, insulin resistance markers and serum adiponectin levels were determined. RESULTS: In placebo group: AI did not improve during the treatment period. Liver function and adiponectin levels did not change during the study.In multiple linear regression analysis, the independent predictors of arterial stiffness improvement were metformin treatment and increase in circulating adiponectin levels.Among metformin treated patients: AI decreased significantly during the study.

Mediterranean drinking patterns of moderate alcohol consumption as part of daily life have often been assumed to protect young people from harmful alcohol consumption, in contrast to Northern European drinking patterns. Nightlife environments are strong related to alcohol and drugs use, and other health risk behaviours but few cross-national studies have been undertaken amongst young Europeans frequenting bars and nightclubs. This study aims to understand differences in nightlife risk-taking behaviours between young nightlife users from Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean cultures, including alcohol and illicit drug use, unprotected sex, violence and driving under the influence of alcohol. METHODS: A total of 1363 regular nightlife users aged 16-35 years were surveyed in nine European cities by means of a self-reported questionnaire. Sample selection was done through respondent driven sampling techniques. RESULTS: after controlling for demographic variables, no differences among the Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean samples were found in current alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, or cocaine use, neither in violent behaviours, but Northern people were more likely to get drunk [adjusted odds ratio (AOR)\u2009=\u20090.53], while Mediterranean were more likely to have unprotected sex (AOR\u2009=\u20092.01) and to drive drunken (AOR\u2009=\u20095.86).",

These databases are used by medical professionals or law enforcement officials to identify patients with prescription drug use patterns indicative of abuse or providers engaging in illegal activities. Most states have implemented PMPs in an attempt to curb prescription drug abuse and diversion. However, assessment of their impact on drug abuse is only beginning. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between PMPs and opioid misuse over time in two drug abuse surveillance data sources. METHODS: Data from the RADARS\u00ae System Poison Center and Opioid Treatment surveillance databases were used to obtain measures of abuse and misuse of opioids. Repeated measures negative binomial regression was applied to quarterly surveillance data (from 2003 to mid-2009) to estimate and compare opioid abuse and misuse trends. PMP presence was modeled as a time varying covariate for each state. RESULTS: Results support an association between PMPs and mitigated opioid abuse and misuse trends. Without a PMP in place, Poison Center intentional exposures increased, on average, 1.9% per quarter, whereas opioid intentional exposures increase 0.2% (P = 0.036) per quarter with a PMP in place. Opioid treatment admissions increase, on average, 4.9% per quarter in states without a PMP vs 2.6% (P = 0.058) in states with a PMP. In addition to the time trend, population and a measure of drug availability were also significant predictors.

        "input": "OBJECTIVES: Recent improvements in socioeconomic conditions have changed the clinical picture of urinary stones, including bladder calculi. With the ongoing changes in these predisposing factors, it is possible that the clinical picture of bladder calculi will show additional changes. Nevertheless, few contemporary series of bladder calculi in published English reports have addressed these issues. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 328 patients who underwent surgical therapy for bladder calculi at our institution from January 1995 to June 2005. RESULTS: Acute urinary retention was the most common presenting symptom (n = 221, 67%). Patients who presented with urinary retention were younger (37 versus 48 years, P<0.001), had a greater incidence of recent renal colic (40% versus 19%, P<0.01), and had a lower incidence of bladder outlet obstruction (14% versus 37%, P<0.001) compared with the nonretention group. However, previous stone passage did not influence the probability of presenting with urinary retention. Small bladder stones were associated with a greater likelihood of presenting with urinary retention. The retention group had greater incidence of stones less than 1 cm in diameter compared with the nonretention group (72% versus 39%, P<0.001). Finally, calcium oxalate was found in 78% of patients with bladder calculi.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen PS and 16 SP implants restorated with fixed prosthesis were included. Standard implant dimensions were used for both implant systems. After 3\u00a0months of osseointegration, implants were connected to abutments and final restorations were performed. Marginal bone loss was measured by standardized periapical radiographs. Implant stability/mobility was determined by resonance frequency analysis (RFA) and mobility measuring (MM) device values. Peri-implant parameters were evaluated with clinical periodontal indices and all parameters were assessed at baseline, 1, 3, and 6\u00a0months after the surgery. RESULTS: After 6\u00a0months, all implants showed uneventful healing. Radiographic evaluation showed a mean bone loss of 0.72\u00a0mm for PS and 0.56\u00a0mm for SP implants, and there were no significant differences between implant types. At 6\u00a0months, mean implant stability quotient (ISQ) values were 73.38 and 77 for PS and SP implants, respectively. Mean MM values were -4.75 for PS and -6.38 for SP implants.

It is a difficult question for occupational and primary care physicians who must often address whether a worker with an inguinal hernia should be restricted from work requiring lifting of heavy objects. METHODS: To evaluate the possible work-relatedness of inguinal hernias, a cross-sectional study was performed. The goal of the study was to determine hernia incidence according to occupation with the Annual Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses from the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 1994. Hernia incidence rates (per 10,000 workers) for industry and occupation categories were calculated with the estimates of the number of hernias in males and the employed male workers from the Current Population Survey. Rate ratios (RR) of hernia incidence rates were calculated. RESULTS: In 1994, an estimated 30, 791 work-related hernias in males were reported by US private establishments. The occupation groups with the highest RR were laborers and handlers (RR, 2.47; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.14-2.80), machine operators (RR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.81-2.44), and mechanics and repairers (RR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.43-2.00).",

Indications were: infiltration of the pulmonary vein in the left atrium (four cases), one case where the tumor (a paraganglioma apparently located in the subcarinal space) was actually in the atrium wall, one mediastinal liposarcoma with massive infiltration of the pericardium and the main pulmonary artery, and three tracheal tumors (2 cylindromas and 1 carcinoid). RESULTS: Indication for CPB was decided preoperatively in 7 cases and intraoperatively in the other 2 patients. Cardiac infiltration was confirmed with intraoperative transesophageal cardiac echography in 2 patients, which proved to be very useful. Concerning postoperative complications, one patient died intraoperatively because it was impossible to stop the CPB after reconstruction of the bifurcation of the main pulmonary artery. Although the duration of the operation was significantly increased by the use of cardiopulmonary by-pass, it did not influence postoperative recovery in any of the other eight patients, as far as bleeding or infection was concerned. In one patient, a thoracic drain had to be replaced due to a partial pneumothorax. In another patient a partial dehiscence of the neo-carina was conservatively treated. Long-term results were influenced by the initial pathology of the patient.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: The health service of China has encountered significant challenges due to inequalities in socio-economic determinants of health. HIV patients are known to suffer from social stigma, and may receive inadequate responsiveness from health providers. Before assessing the responsiveness they receive, it is important to know their expectations. We aimed to compare levels of expectation towards the healthcare service among HIV and non-HIV patients with adjustment for socio-economic factors. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted during January and February, 2015 among two consecutive groups of HIV positive and non-HIV patients in two hospitals in Kunming, China. Patients' expectation towards eight domains of health system responsiveness was measured using 40 vignettes; five per domain. Each vignette was ranked from 1 \"very good\" to 5 \"very bad\", and the responses were summed to obtain a total score for each domain. Differences in total scores were compared between the two groups and adjusted for other factors using multiple linear regression. RESULTS: The three domains with the highest scores, reflecting high expectation, were prompt attention, basic amenities and choice. Adjusted for other factors, HIV patients had significantly lower levels of expectation in all domains compared to the non-HIV group. Age was associated with the basic amenities domain, with young adults having higher expectations than other age groups. Minority ethnic groups had lower expectation towards dignity, prompt attention and autonomy domains compared to Han ethnicity. Those who lived in a home with 2-4 family members had higher expectations towards confidentiality than those who lived alone.",
        "output": "Yes, socio-economic differences can explain the low expectation of health services among HIV patients compared to non-HIV counterparts. Lower income, younger age, minority ethnicity, and living in a home with 2-4 family members were associated with lower expectation of health services among HIV patients."

        "input": "BACKGROUND: In the 13C-octanoate breath test, the shape of the 13CO2 excretion curve in the ascending portion reflects a pattern of gastric emptying (GE). Recent scintigraphic studies have revealed an overall delay in solid GE in fertile women compared with men. However, it remains unknown whether women have a different GE pattern compared with men. As a symptomatic delay in solid GE is specific to the female gender, it could be hypothesized that the 13CO2 excretion curve is different in shape between genders. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Because the ascending gradient of the 13CO2 excretion curve is often biphasic, the dual function of y(t) = ( a1 . tb1 + a2 . tb2) e(-K.t) was applied to fit the breath data, where a1, b1, a2, b2, and K are constants. Assessed on the 4 h-based breath samples obtained after ingestion of a 320-kcal muffin containing 100 mg 13C-octanoate, the time versus 13CO2 excretion curve was created from 31 adult volunteers (15 men and 16 women). The curve shape was characterized by the dual function, and was compared between genders. RESULTS: In both genders, the ascending gradient exhibited the biphasic feature, characterized by an initial steep rise and the subsequent blunted increase, while the descending gradient followed the monotonous decay. The initial rise was steeper and the subsequent increase was more blunted in women than in men.",
        "output": "Yes, the pattern of solid-phase gastric emptying is different between genders. Women have a slower and more gradual pattern of solid-phase gastric emptying compared to men."

Patients presenting with a high clinical suspicion of rib fracture(s) to the Accident and Emergency Department were referred for radiological work-up with a PA chest radiograph, an oblique rib view and a chest ultrasound. Associated lesions, e.g. pleural effusion, splenic laceration and pneumothorax were recorded. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were radiologically assessed. The mean patient age was 31 years (range 16-55 years) and the M:F ratio 3.7:1 (11 men and 3 women). Ten patients displayed a total of 15 broken ribs. Chest radiography detected 11, oblique rib views 13 and ultrasound 14 broken ribs. Ultrasound findings included discontinuity of cortical alignment in 12 fractures, an acoustic linear edge shadow in nine and a reverberation artifact in six. Concordance with plain film findings, and especially oblique rib views, was good, though better when the rib fractures fragments were markedly displaced. One splenic laceration was detected with an associated small pleural effusion. There were no pneumothoraces. The average time of ultrasound examination was 13 min.",
        "output": "Yes, ultrasound is helpful in the detection of rib fractures. It can detect discontinuity of cortical alignment, an acoustic linear edge shadow, and a reverberation artifact, which are all indicative of a rib fracture. Additionally, it can detect associated lesions such as pleural effusions and splenic lacerations. The average time of the ultrasound examination was 13 minutes, which is relatively quick and easy to perform."

However, the relationship appears to be more complex than often assumed and few studies have tracked it over longer time periods. AIMS: To explore the long-term (10-year) transmission of familial drinking during adolescence to offspring drinking patterns in young adulthood. DESIGN: Swedish longitudinal study, assessing the relationship between familial drinking in 2000 and offspring drinking in 2010 using simultaneous quantile regression analysis (n=744).DATA: Data on familial drinking was gathered from the Swedish level-of-living surveys (LNU) and from partner LNU in 2000 while data on offspring drinking in young adulthood was gathered from LNU 2010. Drinking among offspring, parents and potential stepparents was measured through identical quantity-frequency indices referring to the past 12 months in 2010 and 2000 respectively. RESULTS: Young adults whose families were abstainers in 2000 drank substantially less across quintiles in 2010 than offspring of non-abstaining families. The difference, however, was not statistically significant between quintiles of the conditional distribution. Actual drinking levels in drinking families were not at all or weakly associated with drinking in offspring. Supplementary analyses confirmed these patterns.",
        "output": "The results of this study suggest that the familial transmission of drinking patterns does not persist into young adulthood. While families that abstained from drinking in 2000 had offspring that drank less in 2010, the difference was not statistically significant. Additionally, the actual levels of drinking in drinking families were not associated with offspring drinking. These results suggest that the effects of parental drinking on offspring drinking may be limited to early adulthood."

Global ratings may be determined by patient experiences on priority aspects of care. OBJECTIVES: (i) identify patient priorities regarding elements of care for breast cancer, hip- or knee surgery, cataract surgery, rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes, (ii) establish whether experiences regarding priorities are associated with patient-given global ratings, and (iii) determine whether patient experiences regarding priorities are better predictors of global ratings than experiences concerning less important aspects of care. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Data collected for the development of five consumer quality index surveys - disease-specific questionnaires that capture patient experiences and priorities - were used. RESULTS: Priorities varied: breast cancer patients for example, prioritized rapid access to care and diagnostics, while diabetics favoured dignity and appropriate frequency of tests. Experiences regarding priorities were inconsistently related to global ratings of care. Regression analyses indicated that demographics explain 2.4-8.4% of the variance in global rating.

Adjusting melphalan dose according to ideal body weight (IBW) has been proposed as a method of decreasing limb toxicity without compromising outcome. The current study analyzed this proposed dose adjustment. METHODS: We reviewed 99 consecutive patients with lower extremity melanomas treated by ILI at our institution between May 1998 and February 2009. Toxicity and outcomes were tested for correlation with differences between administered dose and calculated adjusted dose, both in mg and mg/L, and with differences between actual limb volume and calculated adjusted limb volume. RESULTS: The median actual body weight was 71 kg, whereas the calculated median IBW was 57 kg (p<.001). Median administered melphalan dose was 7.7 mg/L. The median calculated adjusted dose was 6.5 mg/L (range 3.2-9.3 mg/L, p<.001). None of the three aforementioned parameters correlated with either Wieberdink toxicity grade or outcome. BMI did not correlate with toxicity either. Interestingly, a higher total melphalan dose did not only correlate with higher toxicity, but also with a lower response rate.",

METHODS: A total of 176 children residing in a semiurban slum area in southern India were enrolled preweaning and received either bottled (n = 90) or municipal (n = 86) drinking water based on residence in specific streets. Weekly surveillance visits were conducted until children reached their second birthday. Stool samples were collected every month and during diarrheal episodes, and were tested for the presence of Cryptosporidium species by polymerase chain reaction. Differences in the incidence of cryptosporidiosis between bottled and municipal water groups were compared using Poisson survival models, and a propensity score model was developed to adjust for the effect of potential confounders. RESULTS: A total of 186 episodes of cryptosporidiosis, mostly asymptomatic, were observed in 118 (67%) children during the follow-up period at a rate of 0.59 episodes per child-year. Diarrhea associated with Cryptosporidium species tended to be longer in duration and more severe. Stunting at 6 months was associated with a higher risk of cryptosporidiosis (rate ratio [RR] = 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.91).

Other end points are now being considered and implemented because of the recognized limitations associated with using mortality and morbidity as the sole measures of therapeutic efficacy. METHODS AND RESULTS: This article reflects the discussion and recommendations regarding nontraditional end points for cardiovascular trials generated from a meeting of clinical trial experts convened to discuss this issue. Less common end points that have been used in cardiovascular clinical trials include composite clinical scores integrating measures of quality of life with mortality and morbidity or using the function of vital organs as end points. Appropriate measurement and applications of such end points is controversial.",

Other end points such as composite clinical scores and assessment of organ function have been used in some trials, but there is controversy regarding the appropriateness of these measures. It is important to consider other end points that may provide more insight into the effects of treatments on cardiovascular disease."

A previous study in the authors' institution showed that chest computed tomography (CT) scan was the most important screening technique. Different clinical risk factors in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma for the development of distant metastases were identified. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: To evaluate the authors' diagnostic strategy, the accuracy of screening for distant metastases with chest CT in 109 consecutive patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with risk factors between 1997 and 2000 was retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Preoperative screening with CT revealed 20 patients (18%) with lung metastases and 1 liver metastasis. Despite negative screening with chest CT, 9 (11%) patients developed distant metastases within 12 months during follow-up. Sensitivity of the chest CT was 73%; the specificity was 80%.",

Loss of plantar sensation due to diabetic peripheral neuropathy and other diseases has been shown to further increase this propensity to fall. The ancient Chinese art of Tai Chi has been previously shown as a method to improve balance in healthy elderly adults. METHODS: The aim of this study was to determine if Tai Chi intervention improved both balance and plantar sensory perception in healthy elderly adults and elderly adults with diabetes and plantar sensory loss. Elderly subjects (mean +/- SD age = 73.1 +/- 5.9 years, n = 18) were tested for plantar sensory ability and several balance metrics before Tai Chi training and again after 6 months of weekly sessions. Participants were grouped by initial sensory perception scores (as measured by a vibrometer) in order to make inferences on the effects of Tai Chi on sensory perception. RESULTS: Plantar sensation results show all participants showed significant improvement in sensory ability with the 6 months of Tai Chi training. All groups also had a general improvement in all balance measures, with the greatest improvement seen in those subjects with large sensory losses. Hemoglobin A1C measurements also decreased as a result of the intervention.",

METHODS: We recruited 60 African-American adults with type 2 diabetes who completed a 2.5-year empowerment-based diabetes self-management education and support intervention. Primary healthcare use outcomes included acute care visits, non-acute care visits and days lost to disability. Acute care was a composite score calculated from the frequency of urgent care visits, emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Non-acute care measured the frequency of scheduled outpatient visits. To examine change in patterns of healthcare use, we compared the frequency of healthcare visits over the 6-month period preceding the intervention with that in the last 6 months of the intervention. RESULTS: No significant changes in patterns of healthcare use were found for acute care, non-acute care or days lost to disability. Multiple regression models found higher levels of depression (P = 0.001) to be associated with a greater number of non-acute healthcare visits, and found longer duration of diabetes (P = 0.019) and lower levels of diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.025) to be associated with fewer days lost to disability.",

AIMS: We examined whether a low-lying placenta not overlapping the cervical os in the second trimester increases the risk of obstetric complications and whether there is a cut-off point at which that increase occurs. METHODS: Adverse perinatal outcomes were examined prospectively in a cohort of women with a placenta 0-30 mm from the internal cervical os ('low-lying') at the routine mid-trimester ultrasound and compared to those with a placenta further away. Two composite outcomes of 'major' and 'minor' adverse events were predefined as primary outcome measures, requiring a sample size of 480 women with a low-lying placenta. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: In 1662 pregnancies ('low-lying': n = 484; 'normal': n = 1178), there was no increase in composite adverse outcomes with a low-lying placenta and no cut-off distance within 30 mm from the cervical os at which risks increased.

Whether this increase in the number of teeth will translate into more disease and utilization in unknown. The purpose of this study was to test this \"more teeth, therefore more dental disease\" theory using cross-sectional data. METHODS: In-home personal interview and oral examination data were obtained on a probability sample of elders aged 70 years and older living in the six New England states using the Medicare beneficiary list as a sampling frame. Data on dental utilization, number of teeth, dental caries, and periodontal disease were included in the current analysis. RESULTS: Analysis of variance on subjects with 1-10 (Group 1), 11-24 (Group 2), and 25-32 (Group 3) teeth show that the extent of bleeding on probing, pocket depth, and loss of attachment all increase as numbers of teeth increase. Similarly, a greater number of restored coronal and root surfaces were found in Group 3 relative to the other two groups. Mean numbers of decayed and filled coronal surfaces were 8.4 in Group 1.33.0 in Group 2, and 50.3 in Group 3. In contrast, unrestored coronal and root surface were significantly higher in Group 1 (mean root DS = 1.3) than Group 3 (mean root DS = 0.3). Utilization patterns of those with successful aging dentitions (Group 3) show that they are visiting dentists more frequently than the compromised group (Group 1).",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: There is a 3-fold redundancy in the Genetic Code; most amino acids are encoded by more than one codon. These synonymous codons are not used equally; there is a Codon Usage Bias (CUB). This article will provide novel information about the origin and evolution of this bias. RESULTS: Codon Usage Bias (CUB, defined here as deviation from equal usage of synonymous codons) was studied in 113 species. The average CUB was 29.3 +/- 1.1% (S.E.M, n = 113) of the theoretical maximum and declined progressively with evolution and increasing genome complexity. A Pan-Genomic Codon Usage Frequency (CUF) Table was constructed to describe genome-wide relationships among codons. Significant correlations were found between the number of synonymous codons and (i) the frequency of the respective amino acids (ii) the size of CUB. Numerous, statistically highly significant, internal correlations were found among codons and the nucleic acids they comprise. These strong correlations made it possible to predict missing synonymous codons (wobble bases) reliably from the remaining codons or codon residues.",
        "output": "Yes, codon bias has an evolutionary origin. Codon bias, or the deviation from equal usage of synonymous codons, is a result of natural selection acting on the genetic code. As the genetic code is used to express genes, codon bias has the potential to affect the structure and function of proteins, which can in turn affect an organism's fitness. Therefore, codon bias is subject to selection, leading to a decrease in bias over time as organisms evolve."

METHODS: Serum muscle enzyme changes in 93 PM/DM patients were analyzed over the course of hormone and immunosuppressive agent treatment. From the analysis, a forecasting method was developed to help anticipate possible drug-induced liver injury. RESULTS: Before treatment, CK levels were frequently elevated and showed correlation with ALT,AST,LDH and CK-MB levels (r=0.682, 0.766, 0.739 and 0.784, respectively). After treatment, all muscle enzyme levels were decreased except ALT (p>0.05).

        "input": "BACKGROUND: When some combinations of maternal and paternal alleles have a detrimental effect on offspring fitness, females should be able to choose mates on the basis of their genetic compatibility. In numerous Hymenoptera, the sex of an individual depends of the allelic combination at a specific locus (single-locus Complementary Sex Determination), and in most of these species individuals that are homozygous at this sexual locus develop into diploid males with zero fitness. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this paper, we tested the hypothesis of genetic incompatibility avoidance by investigating sib-mating avoidance in the solitary wasp parasitoid, Venturia canescens. In the context of mate choice we show, for the first time in a non-social hymenopteran species, that females can avoid mating with their brothers through kin recognition. In \"no-choice\" tests, the probability a female will mate with an unrelated male is twice as high as the chance of her mating with her brothers. In contrast, in choice tests in small test arenas, no kin discrimination effect was observed. Further experiments with male extracts demonstrate that chemical cues emanating from related males influence the acceptance rate of unrelated males.",

Because perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) have half-lives of years, growth dilution and the development of a new route of excretion (menstruation) could account for some or all of the reported association. OBJECTIVES: To assess how much of the epidemiologic association between PFAS and delayed menarche can be explained by the correlation of growth and maturation with PFAS body burden. METHODS: We developed a Monte Carlo (MC) physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of PFAS to simulate plasma PFAS levels in a hypothetical female population aged 2 to 20years old. Realistic distributions of physiological parameters as well as timing of growth spurts and menarche were incorporated in the model. The association between PFAS level and delayed menarche in the simulated data was compared with the reported association. RESULTS: The prevalence of menarche, distributions of age-dependent physiological parameters, and quartiles of serum PFAS concentrations in the simulated subjects were comparable to those reported in the epidemiologic study. The delay of menarche in days per natural log increase in PFAS concentrations in the simulated data were about one third as large as the observed values.",

Secondary traumatic stress (STS) characterizes those who exhibit PTSD symptoms related to indirect exposure to a stressor. We hypothesized that caring for trauma patients is associated with symptoms of PTSD/STS. METHODS: Surgeons in various specialties (n = 133) were surveyed from January to May 2012 at two regional surgical conferences. Symptoms of PTSD were identified using the Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale (STSS) using specific diagnostic criteria to measure the psychological impact of exposure to trauma patients. Resilience was measured using the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale 10 items. The amount of time caring for trauma patients was used as a measure of risk exposure. The relationship between STSS, resilience, and exposure to trauma patients was measured with p<0.05 considered significant. RESULTS: Twenty-eight surgeons (22%) met diagnostic symptom criteria for PTSD as measured by the STSS. Approximately two thirds of the surgeons (86 of 133, 65%) exhibited at least one symptom of STS. However, the magnitude of exposure to trauma patients was similar between surgeons with and without PTSD symptoms (p = 0.2177). Higher resilience scores were associated with lower STS scores (r = -0.369, p<0.0001).

It is also estimated that 70% to 80% of adults now remove pubic hair in part or entirety, using a variety of methods. It is hypothesized that the destruction of this pubic hair habitat may account for the falling incidence of pubic lice and may possibly lead to its eradication or atypical presentation.AIM: To report the changing incidence of pubic lice infestation from our unit over the last 10 years and assess its association, if any, with pubic hair removal of any kind. METHODS: Assessment of medical records and questionnaires were used to identify the incidence of hair removal and pubic lice infestation over a 10-year period. Data were anonymized and analyzed to identify any correlation. RESULTS: A significant and strong correlation between the falling incidence of pubic lice infections and increase in pubic hair removal was observed, with a Pearson correlation r value of 0.9686 (95% confidence intervals, 0.88-0.992). The P value is less than 0.0001.",

METHODS: The data analysed were profiles of prescription records by date of supply to the patient. From within the national administrative dispensing claims database, the subset eligible for social security entitlements was identified as individuals by means of their coded permanent identification numbers (PINs). Following the initial supply of an SSRI in January 1996, the subsequent 6 months dispensing of SSRI and TCA antidepressants to these individuals was examined. The main outcome measure was the proportion of individuals to whom SSRIs and TCAs were dispensed concurrently, as an indirect measure of coprescription. In instances where a patient was receiving prescriptions for SSRIs and TCAs that had been written by the one doctor only, the major specialty of the doctor was investigated. RESULTS: 55 271 PINs were dispensed 63 865 SSRI prescriptions in January 1996 which represented over half (52%) of the total community SSRI prescriptions dispensed in that month. The number of these patients meeting the criteria for coprescription of SSRIs and TCAs over the next 6 months was 2773 (5%).

Different methods used to stain senile plaques (SPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) might account for this discrepancy. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Here, brains of 11 patients with dementia were examined. Cryosections and paraffin sections from 6 different brain regions (frontal medial, temporal medial and occipital gyrus, hippocampus, superior parietal lobe and cerebellum) of all cases were stained with Bielschowsky, Campbell, Gallyas and Congo red stains each. RESULTS: The study shows that the Bielschowsky silver stain is insufficient for detecting SPs and NFTs, whereas two other methods proved to be more accurate. SPs were found in similar frequency in all brain regions examined (exception: cerebellum). The highest amount was shown with Campbell silver stain in paraffin sections. In Congo red only 25 percent of these SPs were stained, which is probably due to a great number of them not containing any amyloid. NFTs were found almost exclusively in the hippocampus. The highest number was detected with Gallyas silver stain in cryosections.",

Independent work with healthy subjects suggests that one feature of right hemispheric (RH) linguistic processing is a coarse as opposed to a focused semantic activation. We provide a comprehensive review of the literature to these hitherto unrelated fields of research and present an experiment assessing functional hemispheric asymmetries for language processing in healthy volunteers, differing in the susceptibility to schizophrenia-like experiences and thoughts. BACKGROUND: Forty right-handed men were administered a lateralized tachistoscopic lexical decision task. They also completed the Magical Ideation (MI) scale, which examines a variety of paranormal experiences and beliefs. RESULTS: Although the 20 subjects with MI scores below the median displayed the expected right visual field/left hemisphere (RVF/LH) superiority in lexical decision accuracy, the 20 high scorers were equally proficient in both visual fields. Compared to the low scorers, they made significantly more correct decisions in the left visual field/right hemisphere (LVF/RH).",
        "output": "The results of this study suggest that the right hemisphere is associated with creative, paranormal, and delusional thought. The left hemisphere is associated with focused semantic processing, while the right hemisphere is associated with coarse semantic processing. This could explain why people with schizophrenia, who often have an absence of a clear pattern of hemispheric dominance for language, are more likely to experience creative, paranormal, and delusional thoughts."

The purpose of the present study was to determine if a review of all studies comparing an SSRI with mirtazapine, utilizing persistent improvement as the dependent variable, would suggest that mirtazapine had a more rapid onset than SSRIs. METHOD: All double-blind studies comparing mirtazapine with SSRIs were analyzed. Included in the analysis to determine speed of onset were 298 patients taking mirtazapine and 285 taking an SSRI. Pattern analysis, which has been described and used by other researchers, was employed to study speed of onset. RESULTS: At the end of each of the 3 studies, the total number of responders for each of the drugs did not differ. However, the proportion of responders with onset of persistent improvement in week 1 was greater for mirtazapine (13%, 38/298) than for the SSRIs (6%, 18/285; chi2 = 6.95, df = 1, p = .008).",

METHODS: Data on patients with ruptured, small, anterior circulation aneurysms in good clinical condition (World Federation of Neurological Surgeons grade I or II) and treated with surgical clipping were obtained from various discharge databases for 1997 to 2001, and their outcomes were analyzed in a retrograde fashion. RESULTS: Of the total of 487 patients, 17.6% showed a poor outcome (modified Rankin Scales 3-6) at discharge, and after 1 year, 6.1% remained in poor clinical condition. However, fewer patients were in poor condition both at discharge and after 1 year compared with the surgical and endovascular results for patients entered in the International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial.

Several risk factors have been identified, but the association between religiousness and a wish to die in older adults has been underexplored, and the association between death attitudes and the presence of a wish to die has not been investigated yet. The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between religiousness and death attitudes on the one hand and wish to die on the other hand, adjusting for clinical factors such as the presence of depression or somatic disorder. METHODS: The sample comprised 113 older inpatients (from a psychiatric and somatic ward) with a mean age of 74 years. Psychiatric diagnoses were assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders, and logistic regression analyses estimated the unique contribution of religiousness and death attitudes to the wish to die, controlling for socio-demographic variables, depressive disorder, and somatic symptoms. RESULTS: Both religiousness and death attitudes were associated with a wish to die in univariate models. Adding these variables in a multivariate logistic hierarchical model, death attitudes remained significant predictors but religiousness did not; 55% of the pseudovariance of the wish to die was explained by these variables, with an effective size of 0.89.

METHODS: Twenty-four shoulders of embalmed adult cadavers were included in the study. The distance from the anterior edge of the acromion to the course of the axillary nerve was measured and was recorded as the anterior distance. The same measurement from the posterior edge of the acromion to the course of the axillary nerve was made and was recorded as the posterior distance for each limb. Correlation analysis was performed between the arm length and the anterior distance and the posterior distance for each limb.

Microbiologic contamination of enteral feeding solutions has been previously associated with nosocomial infections. Formula manipulation and hang time contribute to microbial load, and there is considerable variation in hang time recommendations in the medical literature. With cost containment in mind, the purpose of this performance improvement study was to determine if an increase in hang time of a modular tube feeding product would increase microbial load or affect the nosocomial infection rate in pediatric burn patients. METHODS: This biphasic trial initially evaluated the microbial load of the feeding after delivery of two 4-hour aliquots into a container using the same delivery set (total hang time of 8 hours; number of tests = 20). Second, once this feeding procedure was deemed microbiologically safe, tube feedings were administered to patients, and both microbial load and nosocomial infection rate were monitored for 1 year. RESULTS: Contamination levels at the end of the 8-hour period using the same feeding set with 2 consecutive 4-hour feeding aliquots (number of tests = 38) were lower than standard recommendations. The hospital's nosocomial infection rate was not altered by this procedural change, and feeding-set expenses were reduced.",

It is unknown whether this improvement is secondary to the ablation procedure or to the pacemaker mode utilised. To investigate this we reviewed our experience of implanting a dual chamber rate responsive pacemaker with mode switching (DDDR/MS) alone on quality of life in this patient group. METHODS AND RESULTS: Over a 1-year period, 19 patients (mean age 62+/-9 years, 13 female) with drug refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (mean duration of symptoms 8.7+/-7 years, failed 3.1+/-0.9 anti-arrhythmic drugs, amiodarone in 15) were recruited.

The mean score for all patients significantly improved by 39% at follow up (baseline 59+/-24, 1 month 36+/-24, P=0.001). Individually 15 patients (79%) had an improvement in their score, whilst for 13 patients (68%) their symptoms were sufficiently improved after pacing that ablation was not required. The benefit was maintained to a mean follow up of 12+/-5 months (score 31+/-20, P<0.001). Six patients remained symptomatic after pacing and requested further treatment.

        "output": "This study found that pregnant women who play tennis have higher bone mineral density at 12 weeks gestation compared to non-tennis playing controls. However, this difference was not seen postpartum. Additionally, the stiffness of the calcaneus, a measure of bone quality, was lower in the tennis players compared to the controls throughout the study, while bone mineral density was not affected. These results suggest that playing tennis may be protective against bone mineral loss during pregnancy."

Many studies in Europe and the United States have assessed the association of white matter changes with stroke and other diseases. No similar study has been conducted in sub-Saharan Africa, where risk factors for stroke differ. Our objective was to explore the association between severity of white matter changes (based on visual rating scales) and stroke in a Nigerian population. METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 50 patients were retrospectively assessed and scored using 3 different visual rating scales (by Fazekas et al, Scheltens et al, and Manolio et al). The scores were classified as either mild or severe. Clinical indications and MRI scan results were classified into vascular (stroke) and nonvascular groups. The association between severity of white matter changes and stroke on MRI was explored using the Student t test, the Chi-square test, and multiple regression analysis at an alpha level of .05. RESULTS: White matter changes were consistently and significantly more severe in patients with stroke than in patients without stroke (.01 \u2264 P<.001; odds ratios 4.58 and 13.3, respectively) using the 3 visual rating scales. This finding was independent of age and gender as confirmed by regression analysis (adjusted odds ratios 4.8 and 9.2; .015 \u2264 P \u2264 .003).",

This association was consistent across the 3 visual rating scales used. Further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms of this association and its implications for stroke prevention in this population."

OBJECTIVE: to clarify the relationship between muscle mass and physical performance in older adults with weak muscle strength. DESIGN: cross-sectional analysis using the baseline data of 542 older men and women from the Korean Longitudinal Study on Health and Aging. METHODS: dual X-ray absorptiometry, isokinetic dynamometer and the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) were performed. Two muscle mass parameters, appendicular skeletal mass divided by weight (ASM/Wt) and by height squared (ASM/Ht(2)), were measured. We divided the participants into a lower-quartile (L25) group and an upper-three-quartiles (H75) group based on the knee-extensor peak torque. Correlation analysis and logistic regression models were used to assess the association between muscle mass and low physical performance, defined as SPPB scores<9, after controlling for confounders. RESULTS: in the L25 group, no correlation between mass and SPPB was detected, whereas the correlation between peak torque and SPPB was significant and higher than that in the H75 group. Results from the logistic models also showed no association between muscle mass and SPPB in the L25 group, whereas muscle mass was associated with SPPB in the H75 group.",

METHODS: Six halo nevi, seven regressing primary melanomas, and seven primary melanoma (PM) without regression were studied using immunohistochemistry for the phenotype of inflammatory infiltrate and the expression of cytokines involved in fibrogenesis or macrophage regulation. Melanocytes were also evaluated using electron microscopy. RESULTS: CD8(+) lymphocytes predominated in halo nevus, whereas CD4(+) lymphocytes prevailed in melanoma; a few macrophages were only found in melanoma. Fibrogenic cytokines, IL-6, platelet-derived growth factor, and transforming growth factor-beta were only expressed in melanoma, whereas basic fibroblastic growth factor was also expressed in halo nevus. Antifibrotic cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was expressed at a higher degree in halo nevus. Cytokines involved in macrophage regulation were only expressed in melanoma.",

Yet, the role of the human biliary beta-glucuronidase (hBG) in the pathogenesis of pigment gallstone formation still remains unsolved. METHODS: Hepatic bile was collected from bile-duct-obstructed patients on the day of, and 3 days after, biliary drainage. Patients were divided into pigment-stone (PS) group (n = 34) and stone-free (SF) group (n = 29). All patients of the PS group had the complication of cholangitis.

RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 6 years, 14 (23%) patients relapsed, but only one within the retroperitoneum (teratoma) after a limited lymphadenectomy. There was a concordance of 89% between the frozen section of the post-chemotherapy mass and the permanent-section histological diagnosis of the entire lymphadenectomy specimen. Of the 37 patients whose masses showed necrosis on frozen section, three had viable germ cell tumour and one had teratoma on final histology. In all four false-negative cases, residual tumour was confined to the resected mass. Six patients (10%) had surgical complications (one after limited and five after bilateral lymph node dissection).",

Newly trained surgeons are often trained only with the placement of pedicle screws within the thoracic and lumbar spine and not with hooks or other means of fixation. However, if the benefits of pedicle screw instrumentation in terms of correction ability cannot be questioned on some issues pertaining to their safety, their rationale for all situations as well as their long-term adverse consequence and or early or late complications start to arise. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We therefore present four case examples that illustrate the advantages, questions and complications inherent to pedicle screw instrumentation in spinal deformities. These four cases serve as discussion supported by a review of the literature. The literature search was performed to include pedicle screws associated risks, costs and complications. Articles focusing on instrumentation of the thoracic and lumbar spine for the treatment of adult and pediatric scoliosis were reviewed. RESULTS: Pedicle screw instrumentation in the treatment of spinal deformity is here to stay, however a fair number of issues have come up since their widespread use that started 10 years ago: these include their misplacement with the inherent risks to the vascular or neurologic structures, the rate of misplaced pedicle screw not per number of screws inserted, but per patient operated, the number of screws really necessary to achieve a satisfactory outcome while maintaining costs, their contraindications in some very challenging deformities where the risks clearly outweigh their advantage compared to hooks. At last, the use of pedicle screw instrumentation has driven many centers in increasing the safety of such procedures using intraoperative spinal cord monitoring as well as improved imaging technologies.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of the preoperative level of PA with postoperative recovery after surgery due to colorectal cancer disease. METHODS: This is a prospective observational cohort study, with 115 patients scheduled to undergo elective colorectal surgery. The self-reported level of preoperative PA was compared to measures of recovery. RESULTS: Regular self-reported preoperative PA was associated with a higher chance of feeling highly physically recovered 3\u00a0weeks after surgery (relative chance 3.3, p\u2009=\u20090.038), compared to physical inactivity. No statistically significant associations were seen with length of hospital stay, self-assessed mental recovery, re-admittances or with re-operations.

Postictal suppression has been claimed to correlate with the antidepressive effectiveness of an induced seizure. Postictal suppression index (PSI) is derived from a short time span of electroencephalographic recording at seizure termination, and, alternatively, burst suppression (BS) index is defined as the percentage of suppressed epochs within a predefined time period. METHODS: In a retrospective study including 9 patients with a total of 104 recorded ECT sessions, we compared the influence of variables that are known to alter seizure adequacy like age, stimulation dose, electrode position, and the number of the consecutive ECT sessions on both indices, PSI versus BS index. RESULTS: For PSI, electrode positioning turned out to be a significant independent variable, with bilateral placement revealing higher PSI. Electroconvulsive therapy session number was significant for BS index, with lower burst suppression in higher ECT session number. In contrast to PSI, BS index turned out to be a significant covariate of seizure duration. Postictal suppression index and BS index did not show linear but a significant rank correlation.",

METHODS: This was a prospective study of strabismus patients who were candidates for muscle surgery using the adjustable-suture technique. All patients received a total intravenous general anesthesia, which allowed rapid recovery of consciousness. Measurements using the simultaneous prism cover test were obtained in the recovery room immediately after the patients regained consciousness and again 24 hours after surgery. Both measurements were taken before adjustment and were compared. RESULTS: A total of 25 patients were studied. The postoperative alignment changed significantly during the first 24 hours in 84% of our patients.

METHODS: Ninety-six hypercholesterolemic individuals aged 30-65 from three primary care clinics and a worksite clinic received counseling by a physician and/or a dietitian for lifestyle and dietary modifications. Baseline nutritional intake was evaluated using three-day food diaries. Lipoprotein levels were evaluated at six weeks and thereafter every three months for one year. Partial (adjusted) correlations (beta) were calculated between baseline parameters (demographic, anthropometric, nutritional and laboratory) and changes of LDL cholesterol for the short and long term (three and 12 months). RESULTS: The average LDL cholesterol level decreased by 6 +/- 10% (p<0.001) at the end of 12 months. This reduction was positively correlated with baseline LDL cholesterol level (beta = +0.4, p = 0.001), and negatively correlated with the baseline BMI (beta = -0.2, p<0.05) and saturated fat intake (beta = -0.3, p<0.05). The differences between low and high subgroups of baseline LDL cholesterol, BMI and saturated fat intake became apparent only after six to twelve months of therapy and probably result from varying levels of adherence to the dietary regimen.

The purpose of this study was to describe smoking frequency among adolescents and its relationship to physical activity and dietary patterns. METHODS: The research study employed a cross-sectional, population-based design. Adolescents self-reported cigarette smoking, physical activity, and eating behaviors on the Project EAT (Eating Among Teens) survey and reported dietary intake on a food frequency questionnaire completed in school classrooms. The sample included 4746 middle school and high school students from Minneapolis-St. Paul public schools. Mixed-model regression, which was controlled for sex, race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, grade level (middle school or high school), and school, was used to examine the association of smoking with diet and physical activity patterns. RESULTS: Overall, reported smoking frequency was inversely related to participating in team sports, eating regular meals, and consuming healthful foods and nutrients. Smoking frequency was directly related to frequency of fast-food and soft drink consumption.",

METHODS: A total of 149 consecutive, uncomplicated singleton pregnancies at 9-13 weeks' amenorrhea, with certain menstrual history and regular cycles, were investigated with transvaginal ultrasound to establish the relationship between femur length and menstrual age, biparietal diameter and crown-rump length, using a polynomial regression model. A further eight patients with previous skeletal dysplasias in a total of 13 pregnancies were evaluated with serial examinations every 2 weeks from 10-11 weeks. RESULTS: A significant correlation between femur length and crown-rump length and biparietal diameter was found, whereas none was observed between femur length and menstrual age. Of the five cases with skeletal dysplasias, only two (one with recurrent osteogenesis imperfecta and one with recurrent achondrogenesis) were diagnosed in the first trimester.",

        "input": "INTRODUCTION: Our objective was to determine whether dental esthetics have any influence on finding a new job. METHODS: Ten patients with orthodontic treatment needs for various types of malocclusions were selected. Smiling facial photographs of all patients were obtained and digitally altered (orthodontic correction of teeth). After the images were obtained, 2 different questionnaires were prepared (survey groups A and B) with the photographs without alteration (showing malocclusion) and altered (with orthodontic correction). Subjects appeared in one questionnaire (survey group) with an ideal smile and also in the other (survey group) with a nonideal smile. The images were evaluated by 100 persons responsible for hiring staff for commercial companies. In each survey group, 4 questions were asked regarding the individuals' likelihood of being hired, honesty, intelligence, and efficiency at work. Analysis of variance for repeated measures was used to determine the differences in the evaluations of patients with ideal and nonideal dental esthetics for the 4 characteristics evaluated. The level of significance adopted was 5%. RESULTS: The photographs of persons with ideal dental esthetics were, on average, evaluated as superior with respect to intelligence and likelihood of being hired than were the photographs of the same subjects with nonideal dental esthetics. For the characteristics of honesty and efficiency, no significant differences were observed in the evaluations between those with ideal and nonideal smiles (P\u00a0<0.05).",

DESIGN: A single-blind randomized controlled trial with a convenience sample. SETTING: University physiotherapy department. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-four healthy volunteers (32 men [mean age, 28.1+/-5.9y], 32 women [mean age, 27.7+/-5.6y]) were recruited and randomly divided into 4 groups. INTERVENTIONS: The 4 groups received TENS delivered at (1) 2Hz; (2) 100Hz; (3) 2/100Hz alternating frequency; and (4) no treatment (control group), respectively. Electric stimulation was applied over the anterior aspect of the dominant forearm for 30 minutes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mechanical pain thresholds (MPTs) and heat pain thresholds (HPTs) were recorded before, during, and after TENS stimulation. The data were analyzed using linear mixed models, with group treated as a between-subject factor and time a within-subject factor. RESULTS: During and shortly after electric stimulation, HPT increased significantly in the alternating frequency stimulation group (P=.024). MPT increased significantly in both the 100Hz (P=.008) and the alternating frequency groups (P=.012), but the increase was substantially larger in the 100Hz group.",

We propose that surgical excision followed by vaccination with an autogenous condyloma acuminata vaccine is the most effective therapy available in primary and recurrent perianal condyloma acuminata. METHODS: Eighty-three patients with perianal condyloma acuminata were treated from 1985 to 1992. Treatment was divided for patients as follows: surgical excision, 20; bichloroacetic acid, 10; podophyllin and interferon A, 5; excision followed by autogenous condyloma acuminata vaccination twice weekly using 0.1 ml subcutaneously for three weeks increasing to 1.0 ml subcutaneously for seven weeks, 43. Syphilis was diagnosed in seven patients; two were human immunovirus-positive. All but three patients were male. Of those patients treated with the vaccination protocol, 25 had primary and 18 had recurrent disease. RESULTS: Recurrence rates were: excision alone and bichloroacetic acid, 50 percent; podophyllin and interferon A, 85 percent; whereas only 4.6 percent recurred when treated with excision and vaccination.

Although beta-blockers are recommended for all patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) without contraindications, a target heart rate (HR) is recommended only for patients with unstable angina/non ST-elevation myocardial infarction. A contemporary series documenting trends in beta-blocker usage and achieved HR and blood pressures (BP) is not available. The study objectives were to monitor trends in HR and BP in relation to beta-blocker use in a contemporary series of patients with ACS. METHODS: In this observational study, 300 consecutive patients with proven ACS had HR and BP values collected hourly from admission until hospital discharge and averaged at multiple intervals throughout hospital stay. Data on baseline demographic characteristics, beta-blocker doses, and titration schedules, procedures performed, cardiac regimens, concurrent medical issues, and contraindications to therapy were collected. RESULTS: Only 5.3% achieved an average HR of 50 to 60 beat/min throughout the hospital stay. Overall, the average HR was 74 beat/min and average BP was 115/64 mm Hg. Admission daily doses of metoprolol averaged 58 mg compared to discharge daily doses of 88 mg; only 52% of patients had dosage increases.",

The main focus of the current study was to assess fatigue in these patients and to investigate the impact of fatigue and other clinical and psychosocial variables on their quality of life (QOL). METHODS: Ninety-eight ovarian carcinoma survivors (average age of 57.4 +/- 12.5 years) were included in the study. All women had received cancer therapy but had not been treated for at least 6 months. The average time elapsed since first diagnosis was 5.7 +/- 5.5 years.

METHODS: Thirty-nine consecutive gestational hypertensive pregnant women in the third trimester of gestation (GH), 40 nonpregnant essential hypertensive women (EH), and 38 normotensive nonpregnant women (N) matched for age were enrolled into the study and underwent echocardiographic and Doppler evaluations. The GH and EH patients were evaluated prior to the administration of any drug treatment. RESULTS: Left atrial function was similar in GH and N subjects and lower than that in EH patients. Both GH and EH patients had early left ventricular diastolic filling pattern significantly different as compared to N subjects (longer isovolumetric relaxation time, deceleration time of the E wave, and lower E wave velocity in GH and EH vs. N), whereas the late filling properties were similar in GH and N subjects with a lower A velocity, and velocity-time integral vs. EH (p<0.05). Systolic fraction of the pulmonary vein flow was similar in GH and EH patients and lower in N subjects. Altered left ventricular geometry was more common in GH than in EH, whereas normotensive subjects did not show any alteration of the geometric pattern.",

This study aimed to model longitudinal reciprocal associations between social competence (SOC) and language (LANG) pathways in young children with ASD. METHODS: Data were obtained from 365 participants aged 2-4\u00a0years who had recently been diagnosed with an ASD and who were followed over three time points: baseline (time of diagnosis), 6- and 12\u00a0months later. Using structural equation modeling, a cross-lagged reciprocal effects model was developed that incorporated auto-regressive (stability) paths for SOC (using the Socialization subscale of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-2) and LANG (using the Preschool Language Scale-4 Auditory Comprehension subscale). Cross-domain associations included within-time correlations and lagged associations. RESULTS: SOC and LANG were highly stable over 12\u00a0months. Small reciprocal cross-lagged associations were found across most time points and within-time correlations decreased over time. There were no differences in strength of cross-lagged associations between SOC-LANG and LANG-SOC across time points.

METHODS: During a study period of two months, out of hours prescriptions of antibiotic starter packs in A&E were monitored prospectively to determine how many patients returned to the hospital pharmacy or to their general practitioner (GP) for the remainder of the prescribed course. Current costs of out of hours antibiotic prescriptions were calculated, as were the costs of providing a full course of antibiotics on the patient's first visit to the A&E department. RESULTS: During the study period, 571 antibiotic items were prescribed as starter packs (three days' supply) to 437 patients. Of these, 232 (53%) chose to return to the hospital and 175 (40%) to their GP for the follow on prescription to complete their course.

DESIGN: Experimental study. SETTING: University hospital, Germany. MATERIAL: 29 Adult female merino sheep. INTERVENTIONS: Chronic lung lymph fistulas were created. Two of the three groups (1 and 3) underwent right sided lung contusion and haemorrhage to a mean blood pressure of 50 mm Hg for 2 hours. On day 3 groups 1 and 2 underwent intramedullary nailing, and group 3 had external fixators applied. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pulmonary arterial pressure, concentrations of triglycerides, chemiluminescence of isolated polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN), lymph flow, microvascular pressure, filtration coefficient, and permeability. RESULTS: Intramedullary nailing caused a transient significant increase in pulmonary arterial pressure and triglycerides in groups 1 and 2. Chemiluminescence of isolated PMN decreased in group 1 and increased in group 2. Lymph flow increased 2.5 times in group 1 while microvascular pressure decreased; in group 2 the increase was less but microvascular pressure increased. Filtration coefficient in group 1 was five times that of group 2 and there was a twofold increase in permeability. There were no changes in group 3.",

However, the clinical difficulty in using this approach lies in determining which type II SCHFs can be managed successfully without a surgical intervention. METHODS: We reviewed clinical and radiographic information on 259 pediatric type II SCHFs that were enrolled in a prospective registry of elbow fractures. The characteristics of the patients who were treated without surgery were compared with those of patients who were treated surgically. Treatment outcomes, as assessed by the final clinical and radiographic alignment, range of motion of the elbow, and complications, were compared between the groups to define clinical and radiographic features that related to success or failure of nonoperative management. RESULTS: During the course of treatment, 39 fractures were found to have unsatisfactory alignment with nonoperative management and were taken for surgery. Ultimately, 150 fractures (57.9%) were treated nonoperatively, and 109 fractures (42.1%) were treated surgically. At final follow-up, outcome measures of change in carrying angle, range of motion, and complications did not show clinically significant differences between treatment groups. Fractures without rotational deformity or coronal angulation and with a shaft-condylar angle of>15 degrees were more likely to be associated with successful nonsurgical treatment. A scoring system was developed using these features to stratify the severity of the injury. Patients with isolated extension deformity, but none of the other features, were more likely to complete successful nonoperative management.",

METHODS: Balance and plasma studies were conducted in healthy breast-fed infants (n = 17) and in patients with phenylketonuria (n = 4) at the age of 4 weeks, and the plasma investigations were repeated at the ages of 4 and 12 months. The samples were analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy (balance studies) and high-resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (plasma). RESULTS: Molybdenum intake and retention in all infants with phenylketonuria were more than 18 times those of breast-fed infants. The plasma concentrations reflected these differences. A median of 0.04 microg/l was assessed in breast-fed infants at 4 weeks and less than 0.02 microg/l at 4 months of age.

The goal of this study was to develop an objective, data-driven definition for \"elderly\" in trauma care by evaluating mortality risk as a function of age. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 872,861 adult (\u226518\u00a0years) patients from the National Trauma Data Bank's National Sample Program from 2003 to 2010. The primary outcome was risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality determined using multivariate logistic regression. Contribution of age to mortality was investigated through step-wise regression and percent of R2attributable to age. We searched for straight-line trends in mortality rate at each age using the spline function of Statistical Analysis Software. RESULTS: Statistically significant increases in mortality rate were noted at ages 37, 60, and 78. Age was found to contribute 10% to mortality compared with greater than 80% for Glasgow coma scale and injury severity score combined.",

AIMS AND HYPOTHESES: Our aims were to find out whether serious juvenile offenders may be subdivided into clearly defined subgroups and whether such subgroups might differ in terms of the risk factors that predict recidivism. METHODS: In a sample of 1111 serious juvenile offenders, latent class analysis was used to identify subgroups. For each juvenile offender, 70 risk factors were registered. Severity of recidivism was measured on a 12-point scale. Analysis was then conducted to identify the risk factors that best predicted the different patterns of recidivism. RESULTS: Four distinct subgroups of juvenile offenders were identified: serious violent offenders, violent property offenders, property offenders, and sex offenders. Violent property offenders were the most serious recidivists and had the highest number of risk factors. Serious violent offenders and property offenders were characterised by overt and covert behaviour, respectively. Sex offenders differed from the other three groups in the rarity of their recidivism and in the risk factors that are present.

Psychological factors, such as illness perceptions and coping, may play a role in the adjustment to IBD as indicated by mental and physical health, activity, and work impairment. The present study aimed at examining the assumption of the Common Sense Model (CSM) that coping mediates the relationship between illness perceptions and adjustment in patients with IBD. METHOD: In a cross-sectional design, 211 IBD patients (73\u00a0% Crohn's disease, 40\u00a0% male, mean age 42.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.9\u00a0years) attending an outpatient clinic completed questionnaires assessing illness perceptions (IPQ-R), coping (CORS), mental and physical health (SF-36), as well as activity and work impairment (WPAI). Multiple mediation analyses were applied that allow estimating the total and direct effects of all illness perception dimensions and the indirect effects through all coping strategies on the illness outcomes simultaneously. RESULTS: The analyses yielded significant direct effects of perceptions regarding the cyclical course, the chronic course, the severity of the consequences, the comprehensibility, and the emotional impact of IBD on study outcomes. Additionally, significant indirect effects were found for the perceptions regarding the severity of the consequences, the possibility of personal control, and the comprehensibility of IBD on mental and physical health as well as activity impairment through the use of one specific coping strategy, i.e., reduction of activity.",
        "output": "The results of this study suggest that coping plays a mediating role in the relationship between illness perceptions and adjustment in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Specifically, the use of reduction of activity as a coping strategy was found to be associated with improved mental and physical health, as well as reduced activity and work impairment. These findings are in line with the CSM and suggest that coping is an important factor in the adjustment to IBD."

The most frequent null allele of CYP2D6 in European populations, CYP2D6*4, has been studied here in order to elucidate whether a relationship exists between this allele and the risk of developing breast cancer in a Spanish population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-six breast cancer Spanish patients and one hundred healthy female volunteers were genotyped for the CYP2D6*4 allele using AmpliChip CYP450 Test technology. RESULTS: Homozygous CYP2D6*4 frequency was significant lower in breast cancer patients than in the control group (OR=0.22, p=0.04). The heterozygous CYP2D6*4 group also displayed lower values in patients than in controls but the difference was not significant (OR=0.698, p=0.28).

METHODS: Qualitative focus group and individual interviews with seven immigrant GPs, five men and two women, age 36-65 years. Their clinical experience in Norwegian primary health care ranged from four to 30 years. Analysis was conducted by systematic text condensation. RESULTS: First, immigrant GPs described a gradual process of becoming bicultural: the GPs communicate with immigrant patients on their own terms and draw upon their special knowledge from abroad to help selected patients, while also adapting to Norwegian cultural expectations of the GP's role. Second, the GPs described being aware of cultural issues in consultations with immigrant and Norwegian patients, but rarely making these issues explicit. The GPs ventured that cultural awareness, together with their personal experience in their own countries and as immigrants in Norway, made them able to sometimes help immigrant patients better than Norwegian GPs. Third, immigrant GPs experienced a big workload related to immigrant patients, but they accepted this as a natural part of their work. Fourth, immigrant GPs felt that they had to work harder and be more careful than their Norwegian colleagues in order to avoid complaints from patients, and to be accepted by colleagues.",

They have a better understanding of the cultural issues that immigrant patients may have, as well as a better understanding of the healthcare system in their own countries. This can help them to provide better care for their patients. Additionally, they may be able to provide a more culturally sensitive approach to care, which can help to build trust between the patient and the doctor. Furthermore, immigrant GPs may be able to provide a more personalized approach to care, as they have a better understanding of the cultural issues that their patients may face. This can lead to better care and improved patient outcomes. Finally, immigrant GPs may be able to provide a more efficient approach to care, as they have a better understanding of the healthcare system in their own countries and may be able to provide more effective referrals to specialists."

Interpretation of this incongruence as ambivalence overlooks the possibility that happiness about the prospect of pregnancy and desire to prevent pregnancy need not be mutually exclusive. METHODS: Data from the 2006-2008 Border Contraceptive Access Study--a prospective study of 956 Latina oral contraceptive users aged 18-44 in El Paso, Texas--were used to compare women's planned pill use and childbearing intentions with their feelings about a possible pregnancy. Associations between women's feelings and their perceptions of their partner's feelings were examined using logistic regression. Prospective and retrospective intentions and feelings were compared among women who became pregnant during the study. RESULTS: Forty-one percent of women who planned to use the pill for at least another year and 34% of those who wanted no more children said they would feel very or somewhat happy about becoming pregnant in the next three months. Perceiving that a male partner would feel very upset about a pregnancy was negatively associated with happiness about the pregnancy among both women who planned to continue pill use and those who wanted no more children (coefficients, -4.4 and -3.9, respectively). Of the 36 women who became pregnant during the study, 24 reported feeling very happy about the pregnancy in retrospect, while only 14 had prospectively reported feeling happy about a possible pregnancy.",

        "input": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To be able to adhere to discharge instructions after a visit to the emergency department (ED), patients should understand both the care that they received and their discharge instructions. The objective of this study is to assess, at discharge, patients' comprehension of their ED care and instructions and their awareness of deficiencies in their comprehension. METHODS: We conducted structured interviews of 140 adult English-speaking patients or their primary caregivers after ED discharge in 2 health systems. Participants rated their subjective understanding of 4 domains: (1) diagnosis and cause; (2) ED care; (3) post-ED care, and (4) return instructions. We assessed patient comprehension as the degree of agreement (concordance) between patients' recall of each of these domains and information obtained from chart review. Two authors scored each case independently and discussed discrepancies before providing a final concordance rating (no concordance, minimal concordance, partial concordance, near concordance, complete concordance). RESULTS: Seventy-eight percent of patients demonstrated deficient comprehension (less than complete concordance) in at least 1 domain; 51% of patients, in 2 or more domains. Greater than a third of these deficiencies (34%) involved patients' understanding of post-ED care, whereas only 15% were for diagnosis and cause. The majority of patients with comprehension deficits failed to perceive them. Patients perceived difficulty with comprehension only 20% of the time when they demonstrated deficient comprehension.",
        "output": "Patients were aware of their deficiencies in understanding post-ED care instructions only 20% of the time when they actually had deficiencies in understanding. This suggests that patients may not be able to accurately recognize when they do not understand their discharge instructions, potentially placing them at risk for misunderstanding and not following their post-ED care instructions."

Clinical support for the concept comes from one report that 40% of women experiencing recurrent miscarriages had monthly fecundity rates of 60% or greater and thus were designated as superfertile. METHODS OF STUDY: To confirm or refute this finding, clinical histories of 201 women with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss were reviewed and months to desired pregnancy, karyotypes of their products of conception as well as results of laboratory tests including antiphospholipid antibodies and circulating natural killer cells were recorded. RESULTS: The prevalence of superfertility was 32% (64/201) among recurrently aborting women compared with 3% of the general population according to the model of Tietze (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Fifty-nine of the 201 (30%) study patients displayed presence of APA,LA, increased CD56(+) cells, or increased NK cytotoxicity and were designated as having an immunologic risk factor.

Although it is generally accepted that we need a more defined curriculum for GS training, the criteria for limiting its scope remain controversial. One approach is to perform a needs assessment, defined based on an analysis of current GS practice. The purpose of this study was to use such a needs assessment to model a subset of the GS curriculum in colon and rectal surgery. DESIGN: The numbers of colon and anorectal procedures performed in the prior 24 months by 982 GS taking the 2004 ABS Recertification Examination in Surgery were examined to determine the mean number of procedures per surgeon along with the percentage of surgeons who had performed at least 1 of the identified procedures. The impact of using these numbers to define a general surgical curriculum was then examined. RESULTS: Procedures performed frequently and by>60% GS included appendectomies, colostomies, colectomies, hemorrhoidectomies, and anorectal abscess procedures. Procedures performed infrequently, yet performed by>30% of surgeons at least once, included subtotal colectomies, abdominoperineal resections, transanal excisions, sphincterotomies, and anorectal fistulotomies. The procedures performed rarely included ileoanal pouch anastomoses and procedures for incontinence and rectal prolapse.",

In this study we aimed to investigate the effect of maternal ingestion of bromide on the fetal bladder and colon in pregnant rats. METHOD: We separated animals into a bromide group including 30 rats and a control group with 14 rats. Nothing was given to the control group during pregnancy. Intraperitoneally 8 mg/kg/day bromide was given to the study group from the 6th to 12th day of pregnancy. All of the rats were sacrificed on the 20th day of pregnancy. Histopathological examination of fetal colons and bladders was performed. RESULTS: In the bromide group, an increase in the colon and bladder diameter, an increase in muscle atrophy in the colon and bladder wall, an increase in vacuolar degeneration in the muscles of the bladder and colon wall, and a significant decrease in ganglion cell numbers in the myenteric plexus of the colon and bladder were determined.",

The calculated contrast ratios between nidus and adjacent healthy bone from preoperative bone scan and the calculated percentages of count reduction after resection of nidus during intraoperative gamma probe application were compared. Patients were followed up for any recurrence or complications. RESULTS: The mean contrast ratio between nidus and adjacent healthy bone calculated from preoperative bone scan was 43.6% (range 33-53%). Following the nidus excision, an average of 55.8% (range 28-73%) count reduction was estimated with gamma probe in the tumor area. There was no correlation between preoperative scintigraphic contrast ratio and intraoperative gamma probe count reduction ratio (r = 0.46, p = 0.13).

Use of angiotensin II AT1 receptor blockers (ARB) was not significantly associated with bone loss. INTRODUCTION: Experimental evidence suggests that angiotensin II promotes bone loss by its effects on osteoblasts. It is therefore plausible that ACE inhibitor and ARB may reduce rates of bone loss. The objective of this study is to examine the independent effects of ACE inhibitor and ARB on bone loss in older men. METHODS: Out of 5,995 American men (87.2%) aged \u226565\u00a0years, 5,229 were followed up for an average of 4.6\u00a0years in a prospective six-center cohort study-The Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between July 1999 and March 2006, 31 patients underwent the construction of a catheterizable conduit using the Malone principle (MACE) In 22 cases the conduit was re-implanted in the right colon and in 9 cases in the left colon. There were 20 male patients and 11 female patients, with a mean age of 10.23 years. The follow-up period varied from 3 from 83 months (average 25 months). Right and left implantation of the conduit in the colon were compared with regards to the presence of complications, volume of the solution utilized, frequency of colonic lavage, time needed for performing the enema, and degree of satisfaction. RESULTS: One patient with the conduit in the right colon, using the appendix, lost the mechanism after two month follow-up. Thirty patients remain clean and are all capable of performing self-catheterization. No statistically significant differences were found between the groups regarding the variables studied: complications (p = 1.000), solution volume (p = 0.996), time required (p = 0.790) and patient's rating (p = 0.670).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: 407 homosexual males: 251 untreated HIV+ and 156 HIV-. Biochemistry parameters: Total cholesterol (CHOL), HDL-cholesterol (HDL), VLDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol (LDL), triglycerides (TG), apolipoproteins A1 and B (ApoA1 y ApoB) and lipoprotein A. Atherogenic rates: CHOL/HDL, LDL/HDL and log (TG/HDL). HIV+ patients were classified into three groups according to CD4 lymphocytes number. RESULTS: HIV+ patients had lower CHOL, HDL, and ApoA1 and higher CVR rates. These differences showed also between each HIV+ group according to CD4 number and control group HIV-. 76% of the HIV+ patients showed low levels of HDL (less than 40 mg/dL) as compared with 31% of HIV- subjects.",

Ideally tube current should be tailored to the patient's body habitus, but a greater influence on tube current may be the proceduralist's personal preference. The purpose of this study was to compare tube current and fluoroscopy time of different proceduralists for lumbar spine CT-guided selective nerve root blocks, and to correlate image quality to patient diameter and tube current. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty CT-guided SNRBs performed by 4 proceduralists were retrospectively reviewed for tube current and fluoroscopy time. Patient body habitus was evaluated by measuring anteroposterior diameters on scout images. Image quality was evaluated objectively and subjectively: noise was measured in the psoas muscle and images were graded on a 3-point scale. RESULTS: The mean tube current was 59 \u00b1 20 mA and mean fluoroscopy time was 10.4 \u00b1 7.5 seconds. The mean tube current between proceduralists differed by almost 2-fold, and there was greater than 2-fold difference in mean fluoroscopy time (P<.0001 and .01, respectively). Mean AP body size was 27 \u00b1 5 cm. When categoric data of tube current and AP diameter were analyzed, only AP diameter was a statistically significant variable influencing image noise (P = .009).

Ill health and disability can lead to concerns about loss of personal dignity. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether health status affects the perceptions of factors influencing personal dignity at the end of life, and the relationship between those perceptions and sociodemographic characteristics. METHODS: A subsample (n=2282) of a large advance directives cohort study was used. Three different health status groups (good, moderate, and poor) were defined based on the Euroqol-5D and a question on whether they had an illness. For each health status group, we calculated the percentage of respondents who indicated the extent to which the items of the Patient Dignity Inventory would influence their dignity as (very) large. Logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the associations between the perceptions of factors influencing personal dignity and sociodemographics.

The goal of this study was to investigate whether DRUJ should be fixed to prevent recurrent DRUJ instability in distal radius fracture patients with unstable DRUJ following open reduction and volar plate fixation of the radius. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on forty-nine consecutive patients presenting distal radius fracture who were diagnosed with distal radioulnar instability after radius fixation with volar plate. Group one consisted of 24 patients whose DRUJs were fixed in neutral for 6 weeks with 1\u223c2 Kirschner wires (8 cases combined with casting), whereas group two consisted of 25 patients without DRUJ fixation. All patients had radiographic evaluation of their wrist and DRUJ for stabilities and underwent functional evaluation using modified Gartland and Werley demerit scoring system (GW score). RESULTS: All patients were followed-up for an average of 15 months (12-24 months) after surgery. No significant difference was noted between the two groups with respect to gender, age, fracture types and damage types (no noteworthy medical comorbidities in either group). At the latest follow-up, patients in both groups had comparable grip strength, wrist motion, and visual analogue scale (VAS) and GW scores. Only one patient (2.4%) demonstrated DRUJ chronic instability, but did not require any additional surgery.",

STUDY DESIGN: The study population was divided into 3 groups: medical therapy only, conservative surgery, and destructive surgery (surgical procedures that impaired fertility). Data from the 3 groups were compared with respect to general and medical history data, clinical signs on admission, laboratory tests, and ultrasound findings. The p value was considered significant when<0.05. RESULTS: The non-Italian women in the study appeared to be more at risk of developing PID and were overrepresented in the surgically treated groups. C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer values most likely correlated with disease severity. Ultrasound evidence of ovaritis generally led to medical therapy. Conversely, when sonography revealed pyosalpinx or tuboovarian abscesses, surgery was performed.",

However, it is not known whether this tendency is unique to hypochondriasis or whether it can be attributed to high negative affectivity or other anxiety symptoms often found to be comorbid with hypochondriasis. METHOD: College students (N=133) completed measures of hypochondriasis, depression, anxiety, worry, avoidance and estimated the likelihood of various symptoms indicating catastrophic and minor illnesses. RESULTS: Even after entering the other self-report variables, hypochondriasis was the only variable to predict estimates of the likelihood of serious illness. Conversely, being female, high levels of negative affect, agoraphobic avoidance when accompanied by others and higher estimates about the likelihood of symptoms leading to catastrophic illnesses best predicted hypochondriasis scores.",

These aberrant cells could participate in the generation of epileptic activity. The aim of this study was to morphologically and electrophysiologically characterize cells in pediatric CD tissue. METHODS: We used infrared video-microscopy to visualize normal and abnormal-appearing cells. To characterize electrophysiological properties, we used whole-cell patch clamp recordings in tissue slices obtained from 42 cases of pediatric CD (ages 0.2-14 years). The pipette contained biocytin for determination of morphological features. RESULTS: Approximately 25% of recorded cells displayed morphologic differences compared with normal-appearing pyramidal neurons, and were divided as follows: immature, misoriented, dysmorphic, cytomegalic, and balloon cells. Immature cells displayed electrophysiological membrane properties typical of developing neurons. Misoriented pyramidal neurons and pyramidal neurons with dysmorphic processes displayed properties similar to normal-appearing pyramidal neurons. In contrast, cytomegalic neurons and balloon cells displayed abnormal membrane properties. Balloon cells had a very high input resistance and lacked voltage-gated Na+ and Ca2+ currents. Cytomegalic neurons had a very high membrane capacitance, very low input resistance, and showed signs of hyperexcitability, as exemplified by the occurrence of repetitive, slowly inactivating Ca2+ spikes when depolarized.",

METHODS: Between 2001 and 2013, patients who received hepatectomy for CLM and R-CLM were included in study. Patients with non-resectable R-CLM were excluded. RESULTS: One hundred sixteen patients were included: 86 patients in SH group and 30 patients in RH group. Repeat hepatectomy group had more synchronous CLM (76.7 versus 50 %, p\u2009=\u20090.011). From the 86 patients who underwent SH, 69 patients did not have R-CLM. Survival analysis was done from the time of first hepatectomy for the no R-CLM group and the time of RH for the RH group. The 3- and 5-year survival rates for the no R-CLM group were 66.4 and 48.8%, respectively, and for the RH group were 56 and 44.8% respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.841).

Microstructural parameters at the locations examined provided only marginal additional information to quantitative computed tomography in predicting experimental failure strength. INTRODUCTION: It is unknown whether trabecular microstructure differs between thoracic and lumbar vertebrae and whether it adds significant information in predicting the mechanical strength of vertebrae in combination with QCT-based bone density. METHODS: Six mm cylindrical biopsies taken at mid-vertebral level, anterior to the center of the thoracic vertebra (T) 10 and the lumbar vertebra (L) 2 were studied with micro-computed tomography (microCT) in 165 donors (age 52 to 99 years). The segment T11-L1 was examined with QCT and tested to failure using a testing machine. RESULTS: The correlation of microstructural properties was moderate between T10 and L2 (r<or= 0.5). No significant differences were observed in the microstructural properties between the thoracic and lumbar spine, nor were sex differences at T10 or L2 observed. Cortical/subcortical density of T12 (r(2)=48%) was more strongly correlated with vertebral failure stress than trabecular density (r(2)=32%). BV/TV (of T10) improved the prediction by 52% (adjusted r(2)) in a multiple regression model.",
        "output": "No, trabecular bone microstructure does not appear to predict vertebral failure strength more accurately than bone density. Cortical/subcortical density appears to be a better predictor of failure strength."

We prospectively evaluated if routine inflammatory markers could contribute to exclude the presence of acute appendicitis in children. METHODS: Preoperative white blood cell count (WBCC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were prospectively tested in children undergoing surgery for suspected appendicitis. Surgery was indicated on the basis of clinical findings and/or ultrasound scan, but WBCC and CRP values were ignored during the decision-making process. Sensitivity of individual markers and their combinations were assessed. RESULTS: One hundred children (55 males) with a mean age of 9.34 years (SD, 3.54 years) had pathologically confirmed diagnosis of appendicitis. A perforated appendix was found in 23% of cases. Elevated WBCC alone had a sensitivity of 0.6 (confidence interval [CI], 0.506-0.694). Sensitivity of elevated CRP alone was 0.86 (CI, 0.926-0.793). Elevation of either WBCC or CRP or both had a sensitivity of 0.98 (CI, 1.0-0.953).",

        "input": "INTRODUCTION: Tethered spinal cord is defined as a condition in which the conus medullaris ends at a level below the L1-2 intervertebral space. The spinal cord is considered to be tethered when there is a thick filum terminale or low-lying conus medullaris. It has also been reported that a normal level of the conus medullaris and normal thickness of the filum terminale do not mean that there is no cord tethering. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this investigation, we examined 21 fila terminalia; 5 of them were taken from cadavers, and these were used as a control group (group 1; n/n), 8 from patients with a normal appearance of the filum terminale but with clinical symptoms (incontinence) and pathologic results of a urodynamic study (group 2; n/ab), and 8 from patients with an abnormal appearance of the filum terminale and with clinical symptoms (group 3; ab/ab). Interestingly, we found that while fila terminalia in the control group were made up mainly of collagen fibers, more connective tissue with dense collagen fibers, some hyalinization and dilated capillaries were noticed in the fila from group 2. RESULTS: Our results suggest that these histological features may reflect a decreased elasticity within the filum terminale, resulting in a tethering effect on the lower conus in otherwise normal physiological conditions.",

The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between HKA and FS-TS, depending on the method of calculating FS-TS and the direction and degree of knee deformity. METHODS: 120 full-length digital radiographs were assigned, with 30 in each of four alignment groups (0.0\u00b0-4.9\u00b0, and \u22655.0\u00b0 of varus and valgus), from a large cohort of persons with and at risk of knee OA.

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) performed within either 2 or 4 weeks of prostate biopsy is associated with surgical difficulty or immediate postoperative outcome. METHODS: Of the 121 patients that underwent RALP at our institution, 104 patients were prospectively included. Patients were sequentially divided into three groups: first patient in group A (interval from biopsy to RALP: 2 weeks), second patient in group B (2-4 weeks), third patient in group C (more than 4 weeks), fourth patient in group A, and so on. The clinical, operative, pathological, and postoperative functional data were collected. RESULTS: Group A consisted of 31 patients, group B of 33, and group C of 40 patients. Median patient age and median follow up were 61.1 years and 14.1 months, respectively. In group A, mean estimated blood loss was significantly higher than the other two groups, even though there was no significant difference in the mean console time. Postoperative complications did not make any difference among the groups. In the multivariable analysis, the interval from biopsy to surgery did not affect operative times or surgical margins, or the immediate postoperative outcomes (e.g. recovery of erectile function, continence, and biochemical recurrence).",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 168 patients who underwent a conservative laparoscopic surgery for endometrioma, during the period between September 2009 and August 2010 in three university hospitals were studied. A long-term OCs therapy was offered to all women following surgery. Patients were randomly divided into three groups according to different progestins used (desogestrel, gestodene, dienogest). Women who refused a postoperative hormonal therapy served as control. Follow-up visits and transvaginal scan were planned at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24\u00a0months after surgery. All patients who showed an ultrasound persistence of the endometrioma at 1\u00a0month follow-up were excluded from clinical analysis. RESULTS: Of the 168 patients, 131 completed the 24\u00a0months follow-up. Endometrioma recurrence was found in 21 (12.5\u00a0%) of all patients, it was unilateral in 17 cases while bilateral in 4 cases. The rate of recurrent endometrioma was statistically significant in non-users compared to the long-term OCs treated patients.",
        "output": "The results of the study showed that the rate of recurrent endometrioma was significantly lower in the long-term OCs treated patients compared to the non-users (12.5% vs 21%, respectively). This suggests that the progestins used in the OCs may have a role in the prevention of endometrioma recurrence."

METHODS: One hundred and twenty-two consecutive IBS patients (37 male, 85 female) were given lactose hydrogen breath tests (LHBT). Those with positive LHBT followed a low lactose diet for 3 weeks. Those improving on the diet were given double-blind, placebo-controlled challenges (DBPCC) with 5 g, 10 g and 15 g of lactose and a placebo, to confirm lactose intolerance. Those who did not respond to the low lactose diet followed either an exclusion or low fibre diet. Symptoms scores were kept prior to the LHBT, 8 h post-LHBT and daily whilst following any dietary change. Patients with negative LHBT returned to clinic and subsequent dietary interventions were recorded. RESULTS: LHBT was positive in 33/122 (27%) IBS patients. Syrr otom scores prior to LHBT were not significantly different between the two groups, but after LHBT the symptoms in the positive group were significantly worse. Twenty-three patients followed a low-lactose diet of which only nine (39%) improved. Six who did not improve followed an exclusion diet, three improved and all were intolerant of milk.

        "input": "INTRODUCTION: Pancreatic cancer belongs to carcinomas associated with poor prognosis and low survival rate. It has been highlighted that the cancer risk is linked to both environmental and genetic factors. Available studies allow to estimate that genetic factors play a role in 5-10% of patients with pancreatic cancer. Beside other carcinomas, pancreatic cancer occurs in hereditary neoplastic syndromes associated with gene mutations, including CDKN2A, CHEK2, BRCA2. It has also been suggested that BRCA1 mutation is involved given the fact that BRCA1 mutation carriers are at increased risk for pancreatic cancer. However, a role of this mutation is not fully understood. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to assess the relationship between BRCA1 gene mutation and pancreatic cancer in Polish population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 88 pancreatic cancer patients (56 males and 35 females) and 3784 carriers of BRCA1 mutation from 1637 families were enrolled in the study. Almost 65% of pancreatic cancer patients were cigarette smokers. Genotyping for constitutive BRCA1 gene mutation was performed in all patients with pancreatic cancer. ASA-PCR and PCR-RFLP methods were used to detect BRCA1 (5382insC, C61G, 4153delA) mutations. The frequency of pancreatic cancer in families of BRCA1 mutation carriers was evaluated. RESULTS: No carriers of BRCA1 mutation were identified in patients with pancreatic cancer. Only in 11 families (0.7%) with BRCA1 mutation carriers, pancreatic cancer was diagnosed.",

Theories focusing on these mechanisms differ in their description of the relationship between panic and fear. The main controversy concerns whether a PA resembles the classical flight response, or whether it is qualitatively different from fear. According to the first theory, a PA would result in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis) activation, whereas according to the second, it would not. So far, inconclusive results have been reported in studies measuring HPA-axis activity after laboratory evoked PA's. The present study was designed to assess cortisol levels following a 35% CO2 challenge in Panic Disorder (PD) patients compared to healthy volunteers as a measurement of HPA-axis activity. DESIGN: Twenty-three PD patients and 20 healthy volunteers participated in the study. Cortisol was determined in saliva at regular intervals before and after the challenge. Furthermore, attention was paid to possible gender effects. RESULTS: Although the 35% CO2 inhalation induced a significant increase in anxiety, no cortisol increase was found. Moreover, there was no difference between patient and control cortisol values following the 35% CO2 challenge, whereas the delta anxiety scores were far more pronounced in the patient group.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Ten advanced HF patients (50.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.7 years), and 9 age-matched controls underwent vastus lateralis biopsy. Western blot analysis showed that sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA)2a, which is responsible for Ca(2+) sequestration into the sarcoplasmic reticulum(SR), was lower in HF versus controls (4.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5 vs 7.5 \u00b1 0.8 AU, P\u00a0=\u00a0.01). Although phospholamban (PLN), which inhibits SERCA2a, was not different in HF versus controls, phosphorylation (SER16 site) of PLN, which relieves this inhibition, was reduced (0.8 \u00b1 0.1 vs 3.9 \u00b1 0.9 AU, P\u00a0=\u00a0.004). Dihydropyridine receptors were reduced in HF, (2.1 \u00b1 0.4 vs 3.6 \u00b1 0.5 AU, P\u00a0=\u00a0.04). We tested the hypothesis that these abnormalities of Ca(2+) handling protein content and regulation were due to increased oxidative stress, but oxygen radical scavenger proteins were not elevated in the skeletal muscle of HF patients.",
        "output": "The results of this study suggest that abnormalities of calcium cycling proteins in skeletal muscle are also present in humans with heart failure, mirroring the findings in the heart. These abnormalities include reduced SERCA2a protein content and phosphorylation of phospholamban at the SER16 site, which relieves the inhibition of SERCA2a. Additionally, dihydropyridine receptor content was also reduced in skeletal muscle of heart failure patients. These findings suggest that a shared mechanism may be responsible for the abnormal calcium cycling proteins in both the heart and skeletal muscle of heart failure patients."

It has been speculated that hepcidin insufficiency or dysregulation may be the primary defect in genetic hemochromatosis. METHODS: A 62-year-old woman underwent elective liver transplantation for chronic hepatitis C cirrhosis. Genetic testing for hemochromatosis was subsequently performed on the donor and recipient. Liver iron concentration was measured in the donated liver at the time of transplantation, and at day 2 and day 652 post-transplant. Serum hepcidin was measured at day 935 in the recipient and in three other liver transplant recipients. RESULTS: The donor was discovered to have significant iron overload without fibrosis, with a liver iron concentration of 326 micromol/g (normal is 0 micromol/g to 35 micromol/g).

OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between OCD and traumatic life events in children and adolescents. METHODS: We examined the prevalence of traumatic life events and PTSD in a large sample of systematically assessed children with OCD. OCD symptoms and severity were assessed using the Children's Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) in those with and without concurrent PTSD. RESULTS: Rate of PTSD and trauma exposure was higher in children with OCD than in a comparable control group of non-OCD youth matched for age, gender and SES. Children with concurrent PTSD had more intrusive fears and distress and less control over their rituals than children with OCD but without PTSD. Total CY-BOCS scores were higher in those with concurrent PTSD. Specific type of OCD symptoms was not altered by a PTSD diagnosis.",
        "output": "Yes, there is a link between traumatic events and obsessive compulsive disorder in children and adolescents. Children and adolescents who have experienced traumatic events are more likely to develop obsessive compulsive disorder. This link is especially strong when the traumatic event is accompanied by post-traumatic stress disorder. Children and adolescents with obsessive compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder may have more intrusive fears and distress and less control over their rituals than those without post-traumatic stress disorder. Additionally, those with obsessive compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder have higher total scores on the Children's Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale than those with obsessive compulsive disorder without post-traumatic stress disorder."

We measured by ultrasound (US) the perihepatic adipose tissue thickness (PATT), i.e. the thickness of the fat between the abdominal muscular layer and the hepatic surface, in addition to waist circumference, BMI, biochemistry and serum adipokines, to predict the severity of liver damage in NAFLD. METHODS: 63 NAFLD patients and 45 controls were studied. PATT and US steatosis score were assessed in all patients. Histology was obtained in those with an US steatosis score greater or equal to 2. RESULTS: PATT was 13.5 + or - 4.1 mm in NAFLD vs 8.0 + or - 4.1 in controls (p less than 0.001). A PATT value of 11.2 mm seems to represent a cut-off below which NAFLD is unlikely. Test sensitivity, specificity and the area under the ROC curve were 100%, 50% and 75%, respectively, suggesting a good discrimination between patients with non-NASH and those with NASH or borderline NASH. In addition, PATT strongly correlated with waist circumference (p less than 0.001). Both PATT and waist circumference correlated with US steatosis, HOMA-IR, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and leptin. Based on a multiple logistic regression analysis, waist circumferences greater or equal to 110, 113 and 122 cm were associated with a probability over or equal to 50% of abnormal HOMA-IR, TNF-alpha and leptin values, respectively.",

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Severe mitral regurgitation in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy increases the death rate and symptomatic status. The 1-year survival rate for medical therapy in this subset of patients is less than 20%. Transplantation is usually not feasible because of donor shortage and death while on the waiting list. METHODS: To assess additive risk, a retrospective chart review from 1993 to 1998 was performed comparing patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction [EF]<25%) and severe mitral regurgitation undergoing mitral valve repair and coronary artery bypass graft operations with patients with an EF of<25% undergoing coronary artery bypass graft alone. These groups were also compared with 140 patients receiving heart transplants since 1993 (group 3). RESULTS: The overall hospital death rate for group 1 was 6.3%. The one death occurred 2 weeks after surgery secondary to sepsis. This was not significantly different from the death rate of 4.1% in group 2. In group 1, there were two deaths at 1 year (87% survival rate), one related to heart failure. One patient was New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV at 1 year; the remainder of patients were NYHA class I-II. These results were not significantly different than the 8% death rate noted with transplantation. There was no change in EF and minimal residual mitral regurgitation in group 1 based on postoperative transesophageal echocardiography, whereas group 2 had an average 11.7% improvement in EF.",

METHODS: Five patients from one family with GUCA1A and nine patients from four families with GUCY2D mutations were included. Psychophysical and electrophysiological examinations were performed to study retinal function. Fundus autofluorescence imaging and spectral domain optical coherence tomography were performed for morphologic characterization. RESULTS: Genetic analysis revealed the mutation c.451C>T (p.L151F) in the GUCA1A family.

We propose that response propensity has a trait-like component, measurable within the survey. Covariance of this component with survey items could indicate non-response bias. AIMS: To measure and validate trait-like response propensity, to test whether it co-varied with survey items during a routine stress audit and to test whether a prior staff attitude survey may have been biased. METHODS: Stress survey sent to government employees during a routine audit. We designed two new items to measure trait-like response propensity and completion of a prior staff survey. We calculated an odds ratio, correlations and Mann-Whitney U-tests to assess relationships between trait response propensity, completion of the prior staff survey and current stress survey scores. RESULTS: There were 71 respondents; response rate 68%. The trait response propensity item predicted completion of a prior staff survey (odds ratio 8.75, 95% confidence interval 2.32-33.08). Trait response propensity significantly correlated with two of the 40 survey items and did not significantly correlate with any of the eight 'stressor' sub-scales.

As a part of a randomized multicenter trial on timing of bovine surfactant therapy, we aimed at investigating short-term outcome variables in SGA-infants compared with AGA-infants. METHODS: SGA-infants were classified weighing below the 10th percentile at birth and were compared to AGA-infants in terms of prenatal and neonatal characteristics and neonatal outcome. RESULTS: A total of 317 infants were enrolled, 59 SGA- and 258 AGA-infants. Both groups did not differ in gestational age, however, SGA-infants had a lower birth weight. Preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes was observed more frequently in AGA-, preeclampsia in SGA-infants. The rate of intubation, severity of RDS, rate of surfactant administration, pulmonary airleaks and days on the ventilator did not differ between both groups. However prolonged nasal CPAP, supplemental oxygen therapy and chronic lung disease at 28 days and 36 weeks was diagnosed more often in SGA-infants.

Infant regulatory problems at the age of 3 mo were determined from multiple sources of information. An observational procedure was used to assess the quality of mother-infant interaction. RESULTS: At the age of 3 mo, 17% of the infants (n = 55; 27 boys, 28 girls) suffered from multiple regulatory problems. Compared to a control group (n = 264), these children presented more hyperkinetic symptoms throughout childhood. Negativity in the mother-infant interaction and early family adversity each contributed to later hyperkinetic symptoms. When controlling for family adversity, the association between infant multiple regulatory problems and later hyperkinetic problems was rendered insignificant.",

DESIGN: 523 patients admitted to the intensive care department from October 1994 to June 1995 were included consecutively in the study. Health status 3 months prior to admission was assessed retrospectively by proxies using the EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D) and the Karnofsky Performance Status Scale (KF). Patients were classified into four admission categories: trauma injury, scheduled surgery, unscheduled surgery and other medical conditions. SETTING: Department of Intensive Medicine, University Hospital of Bellvitge, Barcelona, Spain. PATIENTS: 84 trauma injury patients, 239 scheduled surgery patients, 57 unscheduled surgery patients and 143 patients with other medical conditions. INTERVENTIONS: The descriptive system and visual analogue scale (VAS) of the EQ-5D and the K.F. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Using proxy responses we found that trauma injury patients had the best PHS and scheduled surgery patients the worst. There were statistically significant differences in mean VAS scores and all EQ-5D dimensions, except self-care, when trauma injury patients or scheduled surgery patients were compared with the other admission categories. No significant differences were found on these variables between unscheduled surgery patients and medical patients.

The goal of the present study was to determine the differences in clinical decision making by attending physicians based on the pH probe results versus MII results. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study in which physicians were initially given pH probe results and asked how they would change the patient's clinical management based on these results. Physicians were then given the MII results and asked how their management would change. Physicians then were asked whether they believed MII affected their clinical decision making overall. RESULTS: pH probe results changed clinical management 40% of the time and MII results changed clinical management an additional 22% of the time. Clinical decision making was not influenced by the performance of pH-MII on or off acid suppression. The escalation of acid suppression therapy was the main management change that occurred based on the pH-MII results.",

Metoclopramide has been suggested to relieve this, but two previous studies have shown conflicting results. METHODS: Ninety-five patients received 10 mg metoclopramide orally after injection of 99mTc-tetrofosmin for the stress scan and 86 patients had metoclopramide after their rest injection. A control group of 82 patients did not receive metoclopramide. Scans were evaluated visually by three readers. RESULTS: Metoclopramide given before the stress scan led to abdominal activity being visually better in 16 scans, worse in 10, and unchanged in 67 scans, compared to the same patient's rest scan without metoclopramide administration. Metoclopramide administered before the rest scan resulted in abdominal activity in 11 scans being visually better, in 19 worse, and 53 scans were deemed unchanged. These differences were not significant. The number of repeat stress or rest scans was not significantly different between patients who had received metoclopramide and those who had not.

Higher density of tobacco retailers is found in neighborhoods with lower income and more racial/ethnic minorities. Same-sex couples tend to live in similar neighborhoods, but the association of this demographic with tobacco retailer density has not been examined. METHODS: For a national sample of 97 US counties, we calculated the number of tobacco retailers per 1000 persons and rates of same-sex couples per 1000 households in each census tract (n = 17 941). Using spatial regression, we examined the association of these variables in sex-stratified models, including neighborhood demographics and other environmental characteristics to examine confounding. RESULTS: Results from spatial regression show that higher rates of both female and male same-sex couples were associated with a higher density of tobacco retailers. However the magnitude of this association was small. For female couples, the association was not significant after controlling for area-level characteristics, such as percent black, percent Hispanic, median household income, the presence of interstate highways, and urbanicity, which are neighborhood correlates of higher tobacco retailer density. For male couples, the association persisted after control for these characteristics.",

Previous studies have supported the protective effect of beta-adrenergic blockade in patients with TBI. We hypothesize that suppression of the catecholamine surge in multiple-injured TBI patients with beta-adrenergic blockade decreases mortality. METHODS: The trauma registry at an urban Level I trauma center was queried for blunt TBI from June 1, 2003, to December 31, 2007. Patients who received more than one dose of beta-blockers (BB) were identified by a review of the hospital pharmacy order database. \u03c7\u00b2 and Student's t tests were used where appropriate. After adjusting for age, injury severity score, admission Glasgow Coma Score, and transfusions multivariable logistic regression was performed to analyze whether receiving BB was protective in patients sustaining TBI. RESULTS: A total of 2,601 patients were admitted with blunt TBI during the study period. Of these, 506 patients (20%) received BB. Despite higher age (51 years vs. 38 years, p<0.0001) and more severe head injury (head Abbreviated Injury Scale score 4.14 vs. 3.81, p<0.0001), there was no difference in mortality (15% vs. 16%). Multivariable logistic regression identified BB as protective in patients sustaining head injury (odds ratio, 0.347; confidence interval, 0.246-0.490), when compared with those who did not receive BB, reducing mortality by 65%.",

METHODS: The association between breast-feeding dose and illnesses in the first 6 months of life was analyzed with generalized estimating equations regression for 7092 infants from the National Maternal and Infant Health Survey. Breast-feeding dose (ratio of breast-feedings to other feedings) was categorized as full, most, equal, less, or no breast-feeding. RESULTS: Compared with no breast-feeding, full breast-feeding infants had lower odds ratios of diarrhea, cough or wheeze, and vomiting and lower mean ratios of illness months and sick baby medical visits. Most breast-feeding infants had lower odds ratios of diarrhea and cough or wheeze, and equal breast-feeding infants had lower odds ratios of cough or wheeze. Full, most, and equal breast-feeding infants without siblings had lower odds ratios of ear infections and certain other illnesses, but those with siblings did not. Less breast-feeding infants had no reduced odds ratios of illness. Findings did not vary by income.",

To test this hypothesis we investigated whether patients with schizophrenia showed impaired learning of task-relevant stimulus-reinforcement associations in the presence of distracting task-irrelevant cues. METHOD: We tested 20 medicated patients with schizophrenia and 17 controls on a reaction time game, the Salience Attribution Test. In this game, participants made a speeded response to earn money in the presence of conditioned stimuli (CSs). Each CS comprised two visual dimensions, colour and form. Probability of reinforcement varied over one of these dimensions (task-relevant), but not the other (task-irrelevant). Measures of adaptive and aberrant motivational salience were calculated on the basis of latency and subjective reinforcement probability rating differences over the task-relevant and task-irrelevant dimensions respectively. RESULTS: Participants rated reinforcement significantly more likely and responded significantly faster on high-probability-reinforced relative to low-probability-reinforced trials, representing adaptive motivational salience. Patients exhibited reduced adaptive salience relative to controls, but the two groups did not differ in terms of aberrant salience. Patients with delusions exhibited significantly greater aberrant salience than those without delusions, and aberrant salience also correlated with negative symptoms. In the controls, aberrant salience correlated significantly with 'introvertive anhedonia' schizotypy.",

We have therefore investigated the effect of DCIS detection rate on the detection of small (<15 mm) invasive cancers in the 95 units of the U.K. NHS Breast Screening Programme (NHSBSP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: DCIS detection rates were examined against large (>or =15 mm) and small (<15 mm) invasive cancer detection rates in women aged 50-64 years at prevalent and incident screens over a 3-year period. RESULTS: After adjusting for background incidence, screening units with the highest DCIS detection of>or =1.3/1000 detected over 20% more small invasive cancers than units with DCIS detection rates within the NHSBSP guidelines of 0.5-1/1000 (P<0.001). Sixty percent of units had DCIS detection rates above the guidelines. There was no correlation between DCIS detection and>or =15 mm invasive cancer detection. The results suggest that over the range of DCIS rates studied, that for every two extra DCIS cancers detected, an additional small invasive cancer (<15 mm) is detected that may otherwise not have been.

Differentiating DIP from Parkinson's disease (PD) may be a challenge to clinicians. One of the factors distinguishing DIP from PD is that discontinuation of the neuroleptic agent in DIP should relieve the symptoms of parkinsonism. The majority of the literature uses the 6-month timeframe between the neuroleptic withdrawal and resolution of the symptoms of parkinsonism. METHODS: We report two cases of DIP wherein the symptoms of parkinsonism persisted more than 6-months from withdrawal of the dopamine receptor blocking agent (DRBA) and the results of their ioflupane iodine-123 (DaT) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan. DaT scan is a newly approved radiopharmaceutical in the United States indicated for striatal dopamine transporter visualization to assist in the evaluation of adult patients with suspected parkinsonian syndromes. RESULTS: The first case is a patient who developed parkinsonism from risperidone, while the second case developed parkinsonism from metoclopramide. In both cases, parkinsonism persisted 6 months after discontinuation of the DRBA, therefore DaT scan was obtained, showing normal striatal dopamine transporter uptake. Nine months after the discontinuation of the DRBA, parkinsonism was significantly improved in both patients but not completely resolved.",

        "input": "OBJECTIVES: This study investigated whether a reasoning bias ('jumping to conclusions'; JTC) found to be associated with higher levels of conviction in delusions is also associated with high-conviction beliefs in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). DESIGN: The experimental design was mixed-effects, with one between-subjects factor of group and one within-subjects factor of task. METHODS: Participants were 16 people with high-conviction OCD (\u2265 50%), 16 people with low-conviction OCD (<50%), 16 people with delusions (\u2265 50% conviction), and 16 non-clinical controls. JTC was assessed using a neutral probabilistic reasoning task (beads task) and a version involving words of differing emotional salience (words task). RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in draws to decision on the beads task between the high-conviction OCD group, the low-conviction OCD group, and the non-clinical controls. The delusions group made significantly fewer draws to decision compared to the non-clinical controls on the words task but not the beads task and significantly fewer draws on both tasks compared with the combined OCD group. Emotionally salient material (words task) did not affect draws to decision in any group.",
        "output": "The results of this study suggest that JTC is not associated with high-conviction beliefs in OCD, but is associated with high-conviction beliefs in delusions. This suggests that the mechanism underlying JTC may be different in OCD and delusions, or that the association between JTC and conviction is stronger in delusions. Further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms of JTC in OCD and delusions."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of RT alone and RT combined with a planned neck dissection for carcinoma of the tonsillar area and to compare these data with the results of treatment with primary surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred patients were treated between October 1964 and December 1997 and observed for at least 2 years. One hundred forty-one patients underwent planned neck dissection, and 18 patients received induction (17 patients) or concomitant (one patient) chemotherapy. RESULTS: Five-year local control rates, by tumor stage, were as follows: T1, 83%; T2, 81%; T3, 74%; and T4, 60%. Multivariate analysis revealed that local control was significantly influenced by tumor stage (P =.0001), fractionation schedule (P =.0038), and external beam dose (P =.0227). Local control after RT for early-stage cancers was higher for tonsillar fossa/posterior pillar cancers than for those arising from the anterior tonsillar pillar. Five-year cause-specific survival rates, by disease stage, were as follows: I, 100%; II, 86%; III, 82%; IVa, 63%; and IVb, 22%. Multivariate analysis revealed that cause-specific survival was significantly influenced by overall stage (P =.0001), planned neck dissection (P =.0074), and histologic differentiation (P =.0307). The incidence of severe late complications after treatment was 5%.",

METHODS: Multivariate simultaneous equations regression was used to analyze data on tobacco industry campaign contributions to state legislators and legislators' tobacco control policy scores in 6 states. Campaign contributions were obtained from disclosure statements available in the specific state agency that gathers such information in each state. Tobacco policy scores were derived from a survey of key informants working on tobacco issues in each state. RESULTS: As tobacco industry contributions increase, a legislator's tobacco policy score tends to decrease (i.e., become more pro-tobacco industry). A more pro-tobacco position was associated with larger contributions from the industry. These results were significant even after controls for partisanship, majority party status, and leadership effects. In California, campaign contributions were still significantly related to tobacco policy scores after controls for constituent attitudes and legislators' personal characteristics.",

We fitted regression models of stage at diagnosis and time-to-treatment (number of days between diagnosis and surgery) to test the hypothesis that travel burden is associated with timely diagnosis and treatment of cancer. FINDINGS: Later stage at diagnosis for breast cancer Medicaid patients is associated with travel burden (OR = 1.488 per 100 driving miles, P= .037 and OR = 1.270 per driving hour, P= .016). Time-to-treatment after diagnosis of CRC is also associated with travel burden (14.57 days per 100 driving miles, P= .002 and 5.86 days per driving hour, P= .018).",

General practice is the ideal setting to address these inequalities however these patients engage less in preventive activities and experience difficulties navigating health services. This study aimed to compare primary care patients with and without sufficient health literacy in terms of their lifestyle risk factors, and explore factors associated with receiving advice and referral for these risk factors from their GPs. METHODS: A mailed survey of 739 patients from 30 general practices across four Australian states was conducted in 2012. Health literacy was measured using the Health Literacy Management Scale. Patients with a mean score of<4 within any domain were defined as having insufficient health literacy. Multilevel logistic regression was used to adjust for clustering of patients within practices. RESULTS: Patients with insufficient health literacy (n = 351; 48%) were more likely to report being overweight or obese, and less likely to exercise adequately. Having insufficient health literacy increased a patient's chance of receiving advice on diet, physical activity or weight management, and referral to and attendance at lifestyle modification programs. Not speaking English at home; being overweight or obese; and attending a small sized practice also increased patients' chances of receiving advice on these lifestyle risks. Few (5%, n = 37) of all patients reported being referred to lifestyle modification program and of those around three-quarters had insufficient health literacy. Overweight or obese patients were more likely to be referred to lifestyle modification programs and patients not in paid employment were more likely to be referred to and attend lifestyle programs.",

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Considerable confusion exists as to the incidence and severity of low back problems in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis fused to the lower lumbar spine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 171 patients met the inclusion criteria of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, Harrington instrumentation, and fusion to L2, L3, L4, or L5, a minimum follow-up of 10 years following surgery, and a detailed questionnaire at follow-up. These were compared to a control group of 209 persons of equal sex, age, weight, and height. Eighty-eight patients were personally evaluated, including radiographs at follow-up. The mean follow-up was 19 years. RESULTS: Back pain, no matter how trivial or infrequent, was noted in 75% of the patients and 65% of the controls, statistically different at P=0.039. Pain intensity was equal to controls in fusions to L2 or L3, but increased in those fused to L4.

HYPOTHESES: (1) Youth pitchers will have differing elbow kinematics with regard to flexion/extension, internal/external rotation, and pronation/supination when compared with nonbaseball athletes and (2) younger youth pitchers will have differing elbow kinematics when compared with older youth pitchers. STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4. METHODS: Twenty-seven healthy male youths age 10 to 18 years were recruited and divided into an experience group (n = 18 pitchers) and a no experience group (n = 9 nonbaseball athletes). The experience group was subdivided by age into the younger experience subgroup (n = 10 pitchers) and the older experience subgroup (n = 8 pitchers). Biomechanics were recorded using an electromagnetic motion tracking system. Subjects from each group were averaged together, and a Mann-Whitney U test was utilized for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The experience group had greater external rotation during late cocking (-47.8\u00b0 vs 5.8\u00b0) and greater flexion during early cocking (112.8\u00b0 vs 100.1\u00b0). The younger experience subgroup had greater range of motion with supination-pronation during early cocking (21.9\u00b0 vs 11.2\u00b0) and late cocking (5.9\u00b0 vs 2.0\u00b0).",
        "output": "Yes, age and experience make a difference in elbow biomechanics when it comes to pitching. The younger experience group had greater range of motion with supination-pronation during both early cocking and late cocking, suggesting that experience and age may play a role in elbow biomechanics when it comes to pitching."

METHODS: A total of 101 healthy adults (80 males and 21 females) were included in this study. The population as grouped into those having amalgam fillings (39 males and 10 females) and those without (41 males and 11 females). Hg was determined in blood, urine, hair and nails to assess exposure. Urinary excretion of beta2-microglobulin (beta2M), N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), gamma-glutamyltransferase (gammaGT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were determined as markers of tubular damage. Albuminuria was assayed as an early indicator of glomerular dysfunction. Serum creatinine, beta2M and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were determined to assess glomerular filtration. RESULTS: Hg levels in blood and urine were significantly higher in persons with dental amalgam than those without; in the dental amalgam group, blood and urine levels of Hg significantly correlated with the number of amalgams. Urinary excretion of NAG, gammaGT and albumin was significantly higher in persons with dental amalgam than those without. In the amalgam group, urinary excretion of NAG and albumin significantly correlated with the number of fillings. Albuminuria significantly correlated with blood and urine Hg.",

        "input": "INTRODUCTION: The most frequently prescribed medications for patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the Rhein-Main region of Germany are aminosalicylates and corticosteroids irrespective of the disease activity. In contrast, immunomodulators only play a marginal role. As anti-TNF therapy is very costly, it is prescribed in outpatient services of hospitals rather than in gastroenterological practices.AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate possible gender-related differences in the therapeutic management of IBD patients treated in the Rhein-Main region of Germany. METHODS: Data records about past medical history, disease status, laboratory values and medical treatment of outpatients of 10 gastroenterological practices and 3 hospitals were collected from November 1st 2005 to July 31st 2007 and analysed with regard to gender-related differences in therapy and disease management. RESULTS: Overall, no statistically significant difference in gender-specific medical treatment could be observed in the study cohort. However, detailed analyses revealed, that 1. women suffering from IBD, who are treated in outpatient services of hospitals, are more often under immunosuppressants, irrespective of disease activity, 2. in gastroenterological practices less than 3 % of patients are prescribed any immunosuppressive therapy (vs. 17 % [men] und 42 % [women]in hospital outpatient services), and 3. anti-TNF therapy is applied more frequently in men as compared to women in hospital outpatient services in both remission and active disease.",

Immunological abnormalities during the acute phase of KD have been described extensively. However, the occurrence of a second immunological disorder in a patient with a history of KD is rarely reported. We evaluated the presence of autoimmune thyroiditis and coeliac disease (CD) in patients with KD diagnosis. METHODS: Ninety consecutive children (57 males and 33 females, median age 5.2 yr, age range 1.6-14.1 yr) with KD were evaluated. All patients were evaluated for thyroid function (thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroxine and triiodothyronine), anti-thyroglobulin (TgA) and anti-peroxidase (TPOA) antibodies, and antigliadin, anti-endomysium and antitransglutaminase antibodies. CD was confirmed by jejunal biopsy if the specific antibody profile was positive. One hundred and fifty Italian children, matched for age and sex and from the same geographic area, acted as controls. RESULTS: A total of five patients (three boys, two girls; 5.5%; P<0.05) were found positive for coeliac antibodies. In all of these patients the diagnosis of CD was confirmed histologically. Regarding thyroid function and autoantibodies, no patient showed subclinical hypothyroidism or autoimmune thyroiditis. No differences in the familial occurrence of autoimmune diseases between KD patients and controls were found (9.1 and 7.9%, respectively).",

METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, general practitioners (GPs) identified a random sample of 10% of patients at cardiovascular risk among all subjects coming to the surgery and collected data on cardiovascular risk factors and history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (CVD). GPs were asked to do a physical examination and record the results of laboratory tests to define the global cardiovascular risk. The use of antiplatelet drugs in patients with established CVD and in healthy subjects at high risk of developing symptomatic atherosclerotic disease was evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 162 GPs from all over Italy recruited 3,120 subjects (51% female, mean age 64 years). Of the 949 with an indication for antiplatelet treatment for secondary prevention of CVD, 442 (47%) were receiving it. Among the 2,071 without CVD, 11% were taking an antiplatelet drug.

DESIGN: Review of 39 CT scans obtained in consecutive patients with Acute Lung Injury. SETTINGS: Fourteen-bed surgical intensive care unit of a University Hospital. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: PEEP-induced decrease in nonaerated lung volume was measured in 39 patients with ALI on a single juxtadiaphragmatic CT section, on three CT sections--apical, hilar, and juxtadiaphragmatic--and on contiguous apex-to-diaphragm CT sections. The percentage of decrease in nonaerated lung volume following PEEP, was compared between one, three and all CT sections using a linear regression analysis and Bland and Altman's method. The decrease in nonaerated lung volume measured on a single and three CT sections was significantly correlated with the decrease in nonaerated lung volume measured on all CT sections: R=0.83, P<0.0001 for one CT section and R=0.92, P<0.0001 for three CT sections. However, measurements performed on a single CT section were poorly representative of the overall lung: bias -6%, limits of agreement ranging between -37% and +25%.

This study examined whether a criterion of normal performance on an established perimeter generates a subgroup with supernormal perimetric performance. METHODS: The right-eye perimetric results of 100 subjects were analyzed. Subjects had visual acuities of 6/12 or better, no history of eye disease, and normal slit lamp biomicroscopic and ophthalmoscopic examinations. Subjects performed test-retest visual field examinations on a Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA) 24-2 test (Zeiss Humphrey Systems, Dublin, CA), and on a custom frequency-doubling (FD) perimeter with targets spaced in the same 24-2 pattern. RESULTS: Test-retest correlation (Spearman rank correlation coefficients, rs) for mean defect (MD) and pattern SD (PSD) were 0.65 and 0.40 (HFA), and 0.82 and 0.39 (FD perimeter). Three subjects with HFA MDs in the lower 5% had similarly low MDs on retest, whereas no subject was common between the test and retest for the lower 5% of HFA PSD. Correlation between the HFA and FD test results were 0.41 (MD) and 0.05 (PSD). Based on these correlations, the bias introduced into perimetric probability limits were determined, by using Monte Carlo simulations.",

METHODS: Consecutive patients with RA were recruited. They were classified as ring wearers if they had worn a gold ring on the left ring finger throughout most of the time since disease onset, or as non-ring wearers if they had never worn a gold ring. Standard hand radiographs (with rings removed, where possible) were taken and articular erosion was quantified at the MCP and proximal interphalangeal joints. RESULTS: Thirty ring wearers (27 female) and 25 non-ring wearers (12 female) were included. The median (25th-75th centile) Larsen score in the left hand ring MCP joint of ring wearers was 1.0 (1.0-2.0), which was significantly less than in their equivalent right hand joint (1.0, 1.0-5.0, p = 0.01).

Since lipid peroxidation is thought to be causally related to chronic and acute events in atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease, we measured lipid peroxidation products and vitamin E in 100 patients with coronary artery disease and compared them to a matched control group. METHODS: 50 consecutive patients with stable angina pectoris (SAP) and 50 consecutive patients with unstable angina pectoris (UAP) were studied and compared to 100 clinically healthy individuals. In addition to conventional lipid and lipoprotein analysis, malondialdehydes were measured as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Lipid hydroperoxides were assayed with the colorimetric methylene blue method. alpha-Tocopherol was quantitated by HPLC after extraction of serum with hexane-ethanol. In the patient group conjugated dienes were also measured. RESULTS: As expected, patients had significantly higher cholesterol, triglyceride LDL-C and Lp(a) values and lower HDL-C values than controls. When patients were divided into groups with SAP and UAP respectively, peroxides and TBARS were significantly higher in the latter group as compared to patients with SAP and to controls. Conjugated dienes were also significantly higher in patients with UAP as compared to patients with SAP.

Traditional management of the deformity with fusion results in a short trunk, crankshaft deformity, and spine and lung growth inhibition. One alternative that potentially minimizes these problems is the vertebral expandable prosthetic titanium rib (VEPTR).QUESTIONS/ PURPOSES: We therefore asked whether the use of the VEPTR in immature nonambulating children with myelodysplasia with spinal deformity would (1) correct deformity; (2) allow growth; and (3) allow adequate respiratory function. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 20 nonambulatory patients with myelodysplasia who were part of a multicenter Investigational Device Exemption study of 214 patients treated with the VEPTR system. Demographics, standard radiographic measurements, pulmonary function parameters, and complications in 16 patients were analyzed. Average age at first surgery was 48.6 months. The minimum followup was 25 months (mean, 59 months; range, 25-164 months). RESULTS: The Cobb angle decreased postoperatively in nine patients, increased less than 10\u00b0 in five patients, and increased less than 20\u00b0 in two patients. The mean increase in thoracic spinal length (growth) by year after the initial procedure with lengthening was 0.48 cm. Ventilatory function improved in 11 patients and deteriorated in five patients.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We identified 222,804 patients diagnosed with National Comprehensive Cancer Network low-, intermediate-, or high-risk N0M0 prostate cancer and treated with local therapy (surgery or radiation alone, with or without hormone therapy) using the National Cancer Database. We used multivariable logistic regression to determine whether the choice of radiation therapy vs radical prostatectomy varied by distance among patients living in rural and urban areas. Analyses were adjusted for geographic location within the United States, age, race, Charlson/Deyo comorbidity score, year of diagnosis, income quartile, education quartile, Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen level, and T stage. RESULTS: Patients living in urban or rural areas were less likely to receive radiation compared with surgery if they lived farther from the treatment facility. Among urban patients living \u22645 miles from the treatment facility, 53.3% received radiation, compared with 47.0%, 43.6%, and 33.8% of those living 5 to 10, 10 to 15, or>15 miles away, respectively (P<.001 in all cases).

METHODS: Using the Department of Veterans Affairs Continuous Improvement in Cardiac Surgery Program, we identified patients who underwent AVR between 1991 and 2007. A prediction model was constructed using stepwise logistic regression methodology for outcome comparisons. RESULTS: Compared with younger patients (age<80 years; n = 6,638), older patients (age>or = 80; n = 504) had a higher prevalence of baseline comorbidities. In a comparison of patients propensity-matched by risk profile (459 from each group), the older group had a higher morbidity rate (21.1% vs 15.5%; p<0.03) but a similar mortality rate (5.2% vs 3.3%; p = 0.19) compared with the younger group.",

        "input": "INTRODUCTION: Helmet laws remain controversial. Opponents believe negative findings are a result of biased statistical analyses that fail to account for the impact of alcohol and drugs. In this study, we evaluated the effect that helmet use had upon injury severity, outcome controlling for alcohol or drug use, resource utilization, and financial burden using the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB). METHODS: Two groups of patients, helmeted and non-helmeted motorcyclists, were identified using the NTDB over an 8-year period. Group differences were compared using nonparametric Wilcoxon tests for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for dichotomous outcomes. To evaluate the effect that alcohol or drug use had on mortality, logistic regression models were created. RESULTS: A total of 9,769 patients were identified by the NTDB of which 6756 (69.2%) were helmeted and 3013 (30.8%) were non-helmeted. Helmet use was associated with lower injury severity, mortality, and resource utilization. Non-helmeted motorcyclists accrued greater hospital charges and were significantly less likely to have health insurance. When controlling for alcohol or drug use, mortality continued to be significantly associated with non-helmet use.",
        "output": "No, non-helmeted motorcyclists are not a burden to society. In this study, it was found that non-helmeted motorcyclists had higher injury severity, mortality, and resource utilization, but when controlling for alcohol or drug use, the difference in mortality was no longer significant. This suggests that non-helmeted motorcyclists are not a burden to society, as the increased risk of injury and mortality is likely due to the use of alcohol or drugs rather than the lack of a helmet."

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Awareness of the economic burden of diabetes has led to a number of studies on economic issues. However, comparison among cost-of-illness studies is problematic because different methods are used to arrive at a final cost estimate. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to show how estimates of hospitalisation costs for diabetic patients can vary significantly in relation to the statistical method adopted in the analysis. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study analyses diabetic patients' costs as a function of demographic and clinical covariates, by applying the following statistical survival models: the parametric survival model assuming Weibull distribution, the Cox proportional hazard (PH) model and the Aalen additive regression for modelling costs. The Aalen approach is robust both for the non proportionality in hazard and for departures from normality. In addition it is able to easily model the effect of covariates on the extreme costs. This cost analysis is based on data collected for a retrospective observational study analysing repeated hospitalisations (N = 4816) in a cohort of 3892 diabetic patients. RESULTS: There is agreement in all models with the effects of the considered covariates (age, sex, duration of disease and presence of other pathologies). An effect of over- or under-estimation, according to the chosen model due to arguably inappropriate model fitting, was observed, being more evident for some specific profiles of the patients, and overall accounting for as much as 20% of the estimated effect. The Aalen model was able to cope with all the other models in furnishing unbiased estimates with the advantage of a greater flexibility in representing the covariates' effect on the cost process.",
        "output": "The choice of statistical model used to evaluate hospital costs in type 2 diabetes care can have a significant impact on the estimated costs. The Weibull model, which is a parametric survival model, may over- or underestimate the costs compared to the Aalen additive regression model, which is a robust model that can easily model the effect of covariates on the extreme costs. The Aalen model was able to cope with all the other models in furnishing unbiased estimates with the advantage of a greater flexibility in representing the covariates' effect on the cost process."

However, isolated reports of fatal hypernatremia after irrigation with normal saline have raised safety concerns about frequent colonic irrigation in children. Significant electrolyte abnormalities have also been reported with hypertonic phosphate and high colonic tap water enemas. Because our patients routinely use tap water for Malone antegrade continence enema irrigations, we examined the safety profile of this practice MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the last 3.5 years 71 patients at our institution have used antegrade tap water enemas for managing fecal incontinence or intractable constipation. Standard serum electrolytes were measured RESULTS: We obtained 101 sets of serum electrolyte measurements in 71 patients at a mean of 8.4 months postoperatively (range 1 to 33). A girl who presented with severe hyponatremia and hypochloremia had not used the Malone antegrade continence enema for several days.

DESIGN: The study utilised an existing-groups design, with alcohol group: binge drinkers vs non-binge drinkers as the independent factor, and scores on the two PM memory subscales of the Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ) and the score on the Prospective Remembering Video Procedure (PRVP) as the dependent factors. Age, anxiety and depression scores, last alcohol use (in hours) and how many years spent drinking, were measured and analysed between the groups. SETTING: Each participant was tested in a laboratory setting. PARTICIPANTS: An opportunity sample of 21 'binge drinkers' (those drinking above 6 units for females and 8 units for males on 2 or more occasions per week) and 29 non-bingers were compared. MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported everyday PM lapses were measured using the PRMQ. The PRVP was used as an objective measure of PM. Alcohol and other drug use were assessed by the University of East London Recreational Drug Use Questionnaire. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale gauged self-reported levels of anxiety and depression. FINDINGS: After controlling for age, anxiety and depression scores, last alcohol use and how many years spent drinking, there were no significant between-group differences on either the self-reported long-term or short-term PM lapses.

Despite consistently positive results in the literature, the mechanisms of effect are unclear. On the grounds that chronic pain is associated with disruptions of brain-grounded maps of the body, a possible mechanism of yoga is to refine these brain-grounded maps. A left/right body part judgement task is an established way of interrogating these brain-grounded maps of the body. OBJECTIVE: To determine if people who do regular yoga practice perform better at a left/right judgement task than people who do not. METHODS: Previously collected, cross-sectional data were used. Using a case-control design, participants who reported taking part in regular yoga were selected against age, gender, neck pain and arm pain-matched controls. Participants viewed 40 photographs of a model with their head turned to the left or right, and were asked to judge the direction of neck rotation. They then completed a left/right-hand judgement task. RESULTS: Of the 1737 participants, 86 of them reported regularly taking part in yoga. From the remaining participants, 86 matched controls were randomly selected from all matched controls. There was no difference between Groups (yoga and no yoga) for either response time (p=0.109) or accuracy (p=0.964). There was a difference between Tasks; people were faster (p<0.001) and more accurate (p=0.001) at making left/right neck rotation judgements than they were at making left/right-hand judgements, regardless of group.",

However, and despite some improvement since 2000-2004, M\u0101ori and Pacific intervention numbers for PCI in 2009-2012 were still 22%-32% lower than expected for the rate of STEMI hospitalisation they experience. Overall revascularisation ratios were significantly lower than expected for M\u0101ori (both sexes) and Pacific females.",
        "output": "The inverse care law still appears to apply in New Zealand, with ethnic minorities having lower rates of coronary artery revascularisation than the majority population, despite having higher rates of hospitalisation for STEMI. This suggests that ethnic disparities in access to care are still present."

We aimed to evaluate whether core length is a significant biopsy parameter in the detection of cancer, especially in the low risk cancer category group. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed pathology reports of 197 patients (2196 biopsy cores) undergoing initial transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy. A multivariate analysis of age, total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration, prostate gland volume, total number of cores and length of biopsy cores was performed. Secondary analyses included stratification by Gleason score. Single core analysis was done to calculate a workable cut off value for core length with optimal sensitivity and specificity in carcinoma detection. RESULTS: Mean age, PSA, prostate volume, and total number of cores were 66.9 years, 12.6 ng/mL, 47.2 cc and 11.1 cores, respectively. Whereas detection of cancer was significantly associated with advanced age (p<0.01) and smaller prostate volumes (p<0.001), PSA levels (p = 0.40) and number of cores (p = 0.20) were not significant predictive factors. Assessment of biopsy core lengths showed that cores harboring cancer (n = 307, average length 14.1 mm) were significantly longer than benign cores (n = 1889, average length = 13.2 mm) (p<0.001). Core length analysis yielded 13 mm cores have an optimal sensitivity (42.8%) and specificity (76.5%) for detection of carcinoma (odds ratio: 2.43). Secondary analyses of Gleason score did not show any difference with respect to core length.",

In a tropical country like India women often complain off prominent symptoms like dizziness, giddiness, fainting and weakness during summer months. The objective was to study the prevalence of above symptoms which are common during summer and its association with variation in blood pressure among normotensive healthy females aged 18-40 years. METHODS: The present study was carried out on 132 women as a prospective observational study which included 2 home visits to the participants in the two different seasons in the months of May-June (summer) and December-January (winter) based on the data provided by the meteorological department of Government of India. Blood pressure and pulse rate (hemodynamic variables) was measured in these seasons and information was collected on the occurrence of the symptoms in these seasons. RESULTS: There was mean decrease of 11.07 +/- 10.29 mm of Hg in Systolic blood pressure&6.79 +/-6.88 mm of Hg in diastolic blood pressure in summer as compared to winter. The symptoms in the form of weakness, dizziness and blackout which are generally perceived by women in this area to be due to low blood pressure were observed in 32.6% of the study subjects in summer compared with 2.3% in winter.

However, there are no definitive conclusions about the effect of indirect revascularization for adult patients. To clarify the value of indirect bypass surgery for adult moyamoya disease, we have analyzed their follow-up angiographic results in comparison with those of the pediatric patients. METHODS: Between 1989 and 1993, 23 patients underwent combined direct and indirect bypass surgery. They consisted of 16 adults (mean age, 35; range, 20-59) and seven children (mean age, 10; range, 3-16). The main symptoms were those due to cerebral ischemia in all but 1 of 23 patients. Preoperative cerebral blood flow studies showed all patients to have decreased vascular reserve (misery perfusion). Postoperative follow-up angiography was done in all patients at a median of 6 months after the surgery. RESULTS: All pediatric patients showed good or moderate development of collaterals through the indirect bypass. Among the adult group, seven patients aged 20 to 29 had angiographic results similar to those of the pediatric group . On the other hand, nine patients older than 30 had results contrary to those of pediatric patients: (1) the degree of indirect revascularization declined to moderate or poor grades (especially in patients older than 40) and (2) the degree of direct bypass filling improved to high or medium grades.",

Is the heritability of MD different in men and women? Do the same genetic risk factors predispose to MD in the two sexes? METHODS: We obtained a lifetime history of MD by personal interview on two occasions from 6672 individual twins and 2974 complete twin pairs. Three diagnostic criteria of increasing narrowness were employed: DSM-III-R, DSM-III-R plus impairment and Washington University. To increase power by controlling for unreliability of assessment, we evaluated sex differences on genetic risk for MD using a structural equation measurement model. RESULTS: Using DSM-III-R criteria, but not the two narrower definitions, heritability of MD was significantly greater in women than in men. In the three diagnostic systems, the genetic correlation in liability to MD in men and women was estimated at between +0.50 and +0.65. These estimates differed significantly from unity for the two broader definitions.",

Visual analog scale (VAS) for knee pain and the knee-specific Western Ontario Mac University (WOMAC) index for pain, stiffness, and disability were recorded. Five additional radiological features apart from those in the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) classification grading system were recorded by two authors who were blinded to the clinical diagnosis. The variables significantly associated were analyzed by linear regression model. RESULTS: Pain was significantly associated with increasing KL grades; physical function was nearly significant and stiffness was not. On analysis of individual radiological features, WOMAC pain was significant with subchondral sclerosis, joint space width, and tibiofemoral alignment although the correlation was week. VAS pain was significant with the latter two and with articular incongruity. Functional disability was associated with medial joint-space narrowing, tibiofemoral alignment, loose bodies, and juxta-articular osteopenia. However, in the linear regression model, pain and stiffness were significantly associated with articular incongruity and functional disability and total clinical scores with juxta-articular osteopenia.",
        "output": "Yes, radiology is a determinant of pain, stiffness, and functional disability in knee osteoarthritis."

This study aimed to be the first to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of SLNB after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in Chinese patients with breast cancer. METHODS: A review of prospectively collected data from breast cancer patients who had SLNB after prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy was performed. A combination of radiopharmaceutical 99mTc-albumin colloid (Pharmalucence, MA, USA) and Patent Blue V dye (Guerbet, France) was used to identify the SLN. SLNB was followed by standard axillary dissection in all patients. RESULTS: A total of 365 patients received SLNB from May 1999 to April 2006. A total of 78 patients with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by SLNB were recruited. The SLN identification rate, false-negative rate and accuracy rate were 83.3, 10.3 and 73.1%, respectively. Analysis was stratified into clinical and pathological response group. Location of the tumour was also found to be an important factor in affecting the false-negative rate (P= 0.019). For upper, outer quadrant tumour, five (32.3%, out of 16) patients presented with false-negative. Patients with more sentinel lymph node harvest had higher accuracy. A total of 22 patients had three or more lymph nodes harvested, and the false-negative rate was 21.7% (5 out of 23 patients) (P= 0.00).",

We wished to characterize depressive symptoms and determine the accuracy of two common screening instruments for major and minor depression in a population of old-old retirees. METHODS: Participants lived independently in one of two Continuing Care Retirement Communities and volunteered for an in-home interview about cancer screening attitudes. As part of this baseline interview, they were screened with the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale. Those agreeing to a second interview received an evaluation using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-IV), performed by a geriatric psychiatrist within two weeks of the initial interview. RESULTS: In an educated and cognitively intact group of retirees averaging 80 years of age, the GDS and CES-D performed poorly using standard cutpoints in detecting both major (sensitivity 60% for both) and minor (sensitivity 33% and 50%, respectively) depression. One in five participants had significant depression as confirmed by SCID-IV evaluation. Twelve percent had major depression and 7% had minor depression.

There was no difference in outcome. We conclude that exceptions to routine HLA matching policies do not have to be made for kidney retransplants. OBJECTIVE: To determine if the kidney graft functional survival rate for retransplants is influenced by presence of HLA mismatches in common with the previous (failed) transplant. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Kidney retransplants have a lower function rate than primary grafts. An anamnestic response to HLA antigens shared with the previous donor could be one factor responsible, but reports in the literature are conflicting. METHODS: Of 420 kidney retransplants with HLA information done at the University of Minnesota, 87 shared>or = 1 HLA antigens specifically mismatched with the previous donor (63 cadaver and 24 living donor retransplants), while 333 did not (247 cadaver, 86 living donor). Patient and graft survival rates were calculated by life-table analysis for recipients with vs. without repeat mismatches, with the significance of differences determined by the Lee-Desu statistic. RESULTS: Patient and kidney graft retransplant survival rate curves were not significantly different (p>or = 0.41) for those exposed or not exposed to the same HLA mismatches as before. At 2 years, 70% vs. 61%, respectively, of cadaver grafts and 71% vs. 78%, respectively, of living donor grafts were functioning.",

Some patients with Crohn's colitis undergo subtotal colectomy, ileostomy, and low Hartmann's procedure in an effort to preserve the rectum. This procedure has also been advocated for patients with severe anorectal Crohn's disease, in whom nonhealing of the perineal wound after proctectomy occurs with alarming frequency. The authors present a review of the literature and three cases of cancer developing in the defunctioning rectal stump despite surveillance proctoscopy. METHODS: Twenty-five patients underwent low Hartmann's procedure for severe anorectal Crohn's disease. Surveillance proctoscopy was performed as follow-up. Development of cancer in the rectal remnant or anus or recurrence of symptoms was managed by resection and adjuvant therapy. RESULTS: One patient developed squamous-cell carcinoma of the anal canal, underwent resection and adjuvant therapy, and was disease free at the time of this study. Two patients developed adenocarcinoma of the rectum. Both underwent resection and adjuvant therapy. One patient died and the other developed a recurrence.",

We hypothesized that a closed unit, in which a unit-based intensivist directly provides and coordinates care on all cases, has improved mortality and utilization compared with an open unit, in which individual attendings and consultants provide care, while intensivists serve as supervising consultants. METHODS: We undertook the retrospective study of outcomes in 2 intensive care units (ICUs)-a traditional open unit managed by faculty intensivists and a second closed unit overseen by the same faculty intensivists who coordinated the care on all patients in a large community hospital. PRIMARY OUTCOME: In-hospital mortality. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, and relative costs of hospitalization. RESULTS: From January 2006 to December 2007, we identified 2602 consecutive admissions to the 2 medical ICUs. Of all patients admitted to the closed and open units, 19.2% and 24.7%, respectively, did not survive (P<0.001, adjusted for severity). Median hospital LOS was 10 days for the closed unit and 12 days for the open unit (P<0.001). Median ICU LOS was 2.2 days for the closed unit and 2.4 days for the open unit (P = NS).

We set out to evaluate how critical care is delivered in Level I and II trauma centers and the extent to which these centers implement evidence-based patient care practices known to improve outcome. METHODS: All Level I and Level II trauma centers in the United States were surveyed using a previously validated questionnaire pertaining to the organizational characteristics of critical care units. Questions identifying the impediments to the implementation of an intensivist model of critical care delivery were added to the original survey. An intensivist model intensive care unit (ICU) was defined as one meeting all of the following criteria: a) the physician director was board certified in critical care; b)>50% of physicians responsible for care were board certified in critical care; c) an intensivist made daily rounds on the patients; and d) an intensive care team had the authority to write orders on the patients. The survey respondents were also queried regarding the extent to which they complied with evidence-based guidelines for care in the ICU. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 65% (295 centers). Only 61% of Level I centers and 22% of Level II centers provided an intensivist model of critical care delivery. Sixty-nine percent of centers had a form of collaborative care with an intensivist, but few centers had dedicated intensivists without responsibilities outside the ICU. The most common reason cited for not involving an intensivist in the delivery of critical care services was a concern regarding a loss of continuity of care. There was limited implementation of evidence-based practices in the ICU; the model of critical care delivery had no effect on rates of implementation of these practices.",

Fasting blood samples were taken from all patients to examine quantities of CRP and IL6 the day before surgery and on the second postoperative day in the intensive care unit. RESULTS: From 54 patients, 11 patients (20.4%) developed atrial fibrillation (AF) after CABG. The median age of patients with AF was 51.45 +/- 10.74 compared with 57.28 +/- 9.04 for patients with sinus rhythm (p=0.072). Cardioplegic time, cross clamp time, and pump time were higher in the AF group, but there was no significant difference between the 2 groups. Preoperative CRP and IL6 levels were higher in patients with AF. The CRP and IL6 increased after CABG in all patients, but it increased more in the AF group.",

We prospectively assessed technological familiarity using a Technology Cognition Questionnaire to determine influence on proper and effective use of an external loop recorder (ELR). METHODS: Patients with palpitations, presyncope, or syncope were assessed for familiarity with technology and provided an ELR for a period of 6 weeks. Proper use of the device was demonstrated to the patient and test transmissions were sent by analog telephone line on a weekly basis. Patients were instructed to activate the device to record cardiac rhythm when symptoms recurred, and to send these recordings via telephone transmission. RESULTS: Ninety-two patients were prospectively enrolled, with mean age 54.9 +/- 20.9 and 42 males (46%). Sixty-five patients (71%) had recurrence of symptoms during the 6-week monitoring period. Among these patients, 40 (62%) were successful in recording and transmitting data such that a diagnosis was made at a median of 8 days (IQR 12.5, range 0-30). Among patients with symptoms during the monitoring period, 36 (55%) had at least one failed recording or transmission. On multivariate analysis, failed symptom recording/transmission was less likely among patients able to program a home video recorder (odds ratio [OR] 0.25 [0.07-0.93]), and more likely among patients who failed a test transmission (OR 3.45 [1.04-11.7]).

It has been suggested that adipose tissue metabolism could be related to the risk of post-operative infection, but this could be partially related to the body-mass index. The aim of this study was to look for a relation between adipocytokine levels and the risk of post-operative infection and its type. METHODS: This prospective cohort study was conducted between March 2013 and March 2014 in two French teaching hospitals. Pre-operative plasma levels of adiponectin and leptin were measured in consecutive patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. All infections in the 30 d following surgery were recorded. RESULTS: Among the 142 patients included, 29 (20.4%) presented a post-operative infection: 26 surgical site infections and three extra-abdominal infections. Adiponectin and leptin levels correlated weakly but substantially with the body mass index (rspearman=-0.26 and +0.31, respectively). While there was no substantial difference between patients with and those without post-operative infection for adiponectin, median pre-operative leptin was substantially greater in patients with post-operative infection (8.67 vs. 4.37\u2009ng/mL, p=0.003). A substantial interaction was found between leptin and cancer. In patients operated on for cancer, the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was lower than in patients with benign diseases (0.597 vs. 0.858, p=0.011). Similar results were observed for intra-abdominal infection and surgical site infection.",

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Multislice CTs of 2,008 patients with different types of oral preparation (positive with barium, n\u2009=\u2009576; neutral with water, n\u2009=\u2009716; and no enteric contrast, n\u2009=\u2009716) were retrospectively evaluated by two radiologists including delineation of intestinal segments and influence on diagnosis and diagnostic reliability exerted by the enteric contrast, using a three-point scale. Furthermore, diagnostic reliability of the delineation of selected enteric pathologies was noted. CT data were assigned into groups: oncology, inflammation, vascular, pathology, trauma and gastrointestinal pathology. RESULTS: Delineation of the bowel was clearly practicable across all segments irrespective of the type of enteric contrast, though a slight impairment was observed without enteric contrast. Although delineation of intestinal pathologies was mostly classified \"clearly delimitable\" more difficulties occurred without oral contrast (neutral/positive/no contrast, 0.8 %/3.8 %/6.5 %). Compared to examinations without enteric contrast, there was a significant improvement in diagnosis that was even increased regarding the reader's diagnostic reliability.

With increasing use of bedside technology, however, autopsy rates have steadily declined. OBJECTIVE: To identify (1) trends in pediatric autopsy rates during the past decade, (2) concordance between antemortem and postmortem diagnoses, and (3) patient characteristics influencing autopsy rates or diagnostic yield. METHODS: All pediatric deaths between January 1, 1984, and December 31, 1993, were retrospectively reviewed. Data collection included demographics for all patients, and length of stay, diagnostic imaging studies, antemortem diagnoses, and autopsy findings for patients with autopsies. Autopsy diagnoses were compared with antemortem findings and classified according to their concordance. RESULTS: Of 297 pediatric deaths, autopsies were performed on 107 patients (36%). Autopsy rates did not change significantly during the study period. Autopsies were not associated with patient gender, race, or insurance status, but increased significantly with age. Autopsies were performed in 26% of infants 12 months or younger, 60% of children between 13 to 60 months of age, and 100% of children 61 months or older (chi2; P<.001). In 34% of cases, new diagnoses were made at autopsy, including 7 cases where new findings, if known before death, would likely have resulted in a change in treatment or improved survival. There was no relationship between new findings at autopsy and age, length of hospital stay, or antemortem imaging studies.",
        "output": "Autopsies in children are still useful, as they can provide valuable information that may not be detected during antemortem diagnosis. Autopsies are more likely to be performed in older children, as the concordance between antemortem and postmortem diagnoses increases with age.

The purpose of this in-vitro study was to investigate the pH levels of several popular brands of bottled water and compare them to various other acidic beverages. Two different brands of marketed alkaline water (with a pH of 8.8 or higher) were also studied, tested for acidity and described. METHODS: A pilot in-vitro study was conducted to determine the pH levels of a convenience sample of popular brands of bottled water, tap water and other known acidic beverages in comparison with the pH values reported on the respective manufacturers' website. Each beverage was tested in a laboratory using a calibrated Corning pH meter model 240, and waters were compared to the corresponding company's testified pH value. Waters were also compared and contrasted based on their process of purification. The data was then compiled and analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: The pH values for the tested beverages and bottled waters were found to be predominantly acidic. Ten out of the 14 beverages tested were acidic (pH<7), 2 municipal (or \"tap\") waters were neutral (pH=7) and 2 bottled waters were alkaline (pH>7). The majority of waters tested had a more acidic pH when tested in the lab than the value listed in their water quality reports.",

This article systematically evaluates the discriminating capacity of a large number of combination tests. METHODS: Free and total PSA were analyzed in stored serum samples taken prior to diagnosis in 429 cases and 1,640 controls from the Physicians' Health Study. We used a classification algorithm called logic regression to search for clinically useful tests combining total and percent free PSA and receiver operating characteristic analysis and compared these tests with those based on total and complexed PSA. Data were divided into training and test subsets. For robustness, we considered 35 test-train splits of the original data and computed receiver operating characteristic curves for each test data set. RESULTS: The average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve across test data sets was 0.74 for total PSA and 0.76 for the combination tests. Combination tests with higher sensitivity and specificity than PSA>4.0 ng/mL were identified 29 out of 35 times. All these tests extended the PSA reflex range to below 4.0 ng/mL. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that the overall diagnostic performance as expressed by the area under the curve did not differ significantly for the different tests.",

This study aimed to determine cancer incidence in the frail relative to non-frail community resident older adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 3969 participants free of diagnosed cancer at the sixth follow-up from three sites of the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE), a population-based cohort study. Frailty status was determined from physical performance testing and self reported dependency in activities of daily living. Cancer incidence over the four subsequent years was identified through linkage with Medicare claims data. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of cancer incidence with respect to frailty status in multiple models with progressive adjustment for covariates. RESULTS: Of the 3969 participants, 1340 (33.8%) were identified as frail. Cancer incidence at 4years was lower in frail participants overall (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.46-0.89) and frail men in particular (OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.33-0.87).

Research suggested that these ratings had different meanings across programs. A report comparing certifying examination performance and ratings of medical knowledge at the program and national levels was developed and sent to program directors after the 1988 through 1992 examinations. The present study investigated whether feedback helped program directors identify where their residents ranked nationally. METHOD: Subjects were first-time takers of the 1986 through 1992 certifying examinations in internal medicine who took the examination in the year they completed training and who received ratings of 4 through 9 in medical knowledge. All subjects were from programs contributing examinees in all seven study years and that received feedback in 1988 through 1991. Year-by-year distributions of program mean percentages of examinees receiving each rating of medical knowledge (4 through 9) were generated. Program means for equated examination scores and ratings of medical knowledge were computed for each year. Correlations between program mean scores and ratings were also computed. RESULTS: The distributions of the ratings were stable across the study years. Mean scores declined while mean ratings were unchanged.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Transdermal alcohol monitoring is a noninvasive method that continuously gathers transdermal alcohol concentrations (TAC) in real time; thus, its use is becoming increasingly more common in alcohol research. In previous studies, we developed models that use TAC data to estimate peak breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) and standard units consumed when the rate of consumption was tightly controlled. METHODS: Twenty-two healthy participants aged 21 to 52 who reported consuming alcohol on 1 to 4\u00a0days per week were recruited from the community. The final study sample included 11 men and 8 women. Both TAC and BrAC were monitored while each participant drank 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 beers in the laboratory on 5 separate days. In contrast to previous studies, a self-paced alcohol administration procedure was used. RESULTS: While there was considerable variation in the times it took to consume each beer, key TAC parameters were not affected by pace of drinking. TAC data were then used in combination with the previously derived equations and estimated peak BrAC and standard units of alcohol consumed.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Developmental resistance, i.e. reduced virulence and speed of kill of late instars, is a limiting factor in the use of baculoviruses for caterpillar control. Agrotis ipsilon multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AgipMNPV) is highly infective to young black cutworms, Agrotis ipsilon, but too slow-acting against late instars for effective curative control on golf courses or sports fields. Chitin-synthesis-inhibiting fungicides containing the active ingredient polyoxin-d are used to control fungal diseases in turfgrass, and similar compounds have been shown in the laboratory to synergize baculoviruses by disrupting peritrophic membrane function. This study tested whether applying the virus together with such a fungicide can synergize AgipMNPV activity against A. ipsilon in turfgrass. RESULTS: The addition of a chitin synthesis inhibitor failed to increase AgipMNPV infectivity to A. ipsilon in the field. Rather, delayed and slightly reduced mortality from viral infection was seen when larvae fed on fungicide/virus-treated grasses as opposed to virus-only treatments. Choice tests revealed the fungicide residues to be a mild feeding deterrent.",

Chart reviews were completed on all 602 PHE visits for a 3-month interval in a primary care setting. A patient satisfaction survey was administered to a convenience sample of the PHE patients. RESULTS: Of all the patients with tests pre-ordered, 87.8% completed the tests. All providers in the division used the process, but some evolved from one template to another over time. Most patients (61%) preferred to get their tests done prior to their PHE appointment. Many of our patients had abnormal test results. With this process, patients were able to benefit from face-to-face discussion of these results directly with their provider.",

METHOD: A questionnaire analysis was carried out of patients aged 16 years and over at registration and after a health check in seven east London training practices. Questionnaires asked about personal background and lifestyle including smoking status, alcohol intake, diet, weight, exercise, cervical smear uptake, and motivation to change unhealthy aspects of lifestyle. RESULTS: Questionnaires were offered to 356 patients registering with the practices, of whom 101 declined or returned inadequate data. Of the remaining 255 patients, 118 (46%) attended a health check with 113 completing a second questionnaire after the check. Non-attenders were significantly more likely than attenders to be of lower social class, unemployed, of African origin and to be heavy smokers. Women who did not attend were significantly less likely than attenders to have had a cervical smear within the last three years. Non-attending mothers were significantly more likely than attending mothers to be single parents.

This crisis critically affected health expenditures and triggered acute rationing. Our objective was to explore health decision-makers' knowledge and attitudes about economic evaluations (EE) and whether health technology assessment (HTA) were increasingly used for decision making. METHODS: A qualitative design based on semistructured interviews and focus groups was used to explore how decision makers belonging to different health sectors implement resource allocation decisions. RESULTS: Informants were mostly unaware of EE. The most important criteria mentioned to adopt a treatment were evidence of effectiveness, social/stakeholder demand, or resource availability. Despite general positive attitudes about EE, knowledge was rather limited. Although cost considerations were widely accepted by purchasers and managers, clinicians argued about these issues as interfering with the doctor-patient relationship. Other important perceived barriers to HTA use were lack of confidence in the transferability of studies conducted in developed countries and institutional fragmentation of the Argentine healthcare system. The new macroeconomic context was cited as a justification of implicit rationing measures. Although explicit priority setting was implemented by many purchasers and managers, HTA was not used to improve technical and/or allocative efficiency.",

Exercise training that improves physical fitness represents a promising approach for managing cognitive impairment in persons with MS. There is limited evidence that physical fitness is associated with multiple domains of cognitive dysfunction across levels of MS disability. OBJECTIVE: This cross-sectional study examined the associations among aerobic capacity, lower limb muscle strength, and cognitive functions in persons with mild, moderate, and severe MS disability. METHODS: The sample included 62 persons with mild (n = 20), moderate (n = 21), and severe (n = 21) MS disability. The participants underwent neuropsychological assessments of cognitive processing speed (CPS; Symbol Digit Modalities Test [SDMT]), verbal memory (California Verbal Learning Test-2 [CVLT-2]), and visual memory (Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised [BVMT-R]). All participants further underwent testing for measuring aerobic capacity (ie, peak oxygen consumption) and muscular strength (ie, peak torque of knee flexors and extensors). RESULTS: Aerobic capacity and muscular strength outcomes were associated with SDMT (r = .35-.41), but not CVLT-2 or BVMT-R (r<.19) scores in the overall sample. Aerobic capacity (r = .42) and knee flexor peak torque (r = .39) were associated with SDMT scores in persons with mild disability, but not in those with moderate (r<.06) and severe (r<.14) disability.",

The nonunion rate and early complication rate following laterally based locked plating in this specific fracture are not well described. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study conducted at three affiliated tertiary care hospitals to evaluate nonunion, early post operative complications, discharge disposition, length of stay, and mortality in patients over 60 years old undergoing laterally based locked plating of a low energy distal femur fracture. RESULTS: Forty-four out of 176 patients were deceased at one year (25%). Predictors of one year mortality included older age, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and delay to surgery greater than 2days (p<0.001). Of 99 patients alive and with follow up at one year, 24 (24%) developed a nonunion and 21 of 24 required nonunion surgery. Development of a surgical site infection was statistically significantly correlated with development of nonunion. Age and CCI did not predict development of nonunion. Average length of stay was 10days and 82% of patients were discharged to a skilled nursing facility. Thirty eight percent of patients experienced at least one postoperative systemic complication.",

RESULTS: Three hundred ninety patients were in race-concordant (black patient, black provider) relationships, while 207 were in race-discordant (black patient, white provider) relationships. The communication-adherence association was significantly modified in race-discordant relationships (p = 0.04).

Logistic regression analysis is used to investigate how life satisfaction and General Health Questionnaire 12 (GHQ-12) caseness are associated with partnership characteristics. RESULTS: GHQ-12 caseness is significantly and positively associated with the number of union dissolutions and negatively with the duration since the most recent union dissolution. This is the case among both genders, in models in which these partnership characteristics are entered separately and jointly, and in models controlling for parenthood status, socioeconomic status and physical health.",

The effect of subsequent cigarettes on HR is less than that associated with the first cigarette of the day, an indication of tachyphylaxis (acute tolerance). To date, smoking/HR studies have not been conducted double-blind. Instead, control conditions have included non-smoking or some type of \"sham\" smoking (puffing on an unlit cigarette or a straw). OBJECTIVE: We investigated the HR response to smoking and its time course using double-blind methodology. METHODS: HR was recorded in overnight-abstaining participants before and after smoking the first, second and third cigarette of the day (40 min between each cigarette) in two sessions. The experimental manipulation involved replacing the second cigarette of one session with a very low nicotine-yield cigarette (0.05 mg; FTC method) compared with the other five cigarettes (1.1-mg nicotine yield). RESULTS: Smoking increased HR by 15, 8 and 7 beats/min (bpm) in the session where all three cigarettes had the higher yield. The comparable values for the session in which the second cigarette had the lower yield were 15, -1 and 11 bpm.",
        "output": "No, there is not tachyphylaxis. The results indicate that smoking increases heart rate by 15, 8 and 7 bpm in the session where all three cigarettes have the higher nicotine yield, and by 15, -1 and 11 bpm in the session where the second cigarette has the lower nicotine yield. This indicates that the effect of nicotine is dose-dependent and that there is no tachyphylaxis."

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Psychosocial competence and frustration tolerance are important characteristics of skilled medical professionals. In the present study we explored the usefulness of applying a comprehensive motivational theory (Goal orientations), for this purpose. According to goal orientation theory, learning motivation is defined as the general goals students pursue during learning (either mastery goals - gaining new knowledge; or performance goals - gaining a positive evaluation of competence or avoiding negative evaluation). Perceived psychosocial abilities are a desirable outcome, and low frustration tolerance (LFT), is a negative feature of student behavior. The hypothesis was that the mastery goal would be positively associated with psychosocial abilities while performance goals would be positively associated with LFT. METHODS: 143 first-year medical students completed at the end of an annual doctor-patient communication course a structured questionnaire that included measures of learning goal orientations (assessed by Pattern of Adaptive Learning Scale - PALS), psychosocial abilities (assessed by Psychological Medicine Inventory- student version -PMI-S) and Low Frustration Tolerance (LFT). RESULTS: All study variables were found reliable (Cronbach's \u03b1 ranged from .66 to .90) and normally distributed. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis revealed significant associations supporting the hypotheses. The mastery goal orientation was positively associated with perceived psychosocial abilities (PMI-S) (\u03b2 = .16, p<.05) and negatively associated with low frustration tolerance (\u03b2 = -.22, p<.05) while performance goal orientation was significantly associated with low frustration tolerance (\u03b2 = .36, p<.001).",
        "output": "Yes, achievement goal theory can provide a useful motivational perspective for explaining psychosocial attributes of medical students. The results of this study showed that mastery goal orientation was positively associated with perceived psychosocial abilities and performance goal orientation was associated with low frustration tolerance. This suggests that medical educators should focus on fostering a mastery goal orientation in their students in order to enhance psychosocial abilities, while at the same time, taking measures to reduce performance goal orientation in order to reduce frustration tolerance."

We characterized the clinical and radiologic parameters of EDH in infants and correlated them with outcome. Because there are no optimal prognostic tools or clear guidelines to perform computed tomography in this unique population, a new approach of neurotrauma scoring is suggested. METHODS: Eleven infants (<2 years old) operated on for EDH were studied. Children's Glasgow Coma Scale (CCS) score was applied, and diagnosis was confirmed by computed tomography. RESULTS: Age was 13+/-5 months. Seven infants (63.6%) fell from less than 1 m. CCS score on admission was 10.7+/-3.9. Five infants (45%) were unconscious, yet two (18.2%) had CCS scores of 15. Pupillary abnormalities were found in two infants and lateralizing signs in five infants. Eight infants (72.7%) had subgaleal hematomas. Mortality and morbidity were 9% each.",

METHODS: Individual, semi-structured interviews were conducted. A maximum variation sample was recruited from La Vallette Social Centre, Sydney, and interviewed by the investigator. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and iteratively coded into themes by constant comparison using computer software. Cultural predictors of adherence were analysed. KEY FINDINGS: Twenty-four participants were interviewed. Themes included diabetes knowledge, self-management behaviours, cultural predictors of adherence and interest in community pharmacy disease management services. Diabetes knowledge was generally limited. Although most participants practised some self-monitoring of blood glucose they lacked knowledge of practice recommendations. Participants generally undertook regular physical activity, though adherence to diet varied according to social influences. Cultural influences on perceptions included attitudes to practitioners, treatment and peer experiences. Enablers included attitudes towards financial independence and social integration while nurturers included family and community support. Participants expressed interest in accessing more support from their community pharmacy due to ease of access and interest in learning more about diabetes.",

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the preoperative status of the adjacent discs, as determined by provocative discography, has an impact on the clinical outcome of lumbar fusion in chronic low back pain (LBP) patients. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The results of lumbar fusion in chronic LBP patients vary considerably and are hard to predict. It is believed that degenerative levels adjacent to a fused spinal segment may be a cause of continuing pain. In this respect, it is important to know whether preoperative degenerative or symptomatic adjacent levels have an adverse effect on patient outcomes after lumbar fusion. METHODS: In 197 patients with an equivocal indication for lumbar fusion (two thirds were patients with prior spine surgery), the decision for either lumbar fusion or conservative management was determined by a temporary external transpedicular fixation trial. During the diagnostic workup, all patients had undergone provocative discography that included the assessment of the discs adjacent to the intended fusion levels. The individual changes in pain on a visual analog scale, assessed before treatment and at follow-up, and patient satisfaction were the measures of outcome. RESULTS: In the 82 patients who underwent a lumbar fusion, no difference in outcome was found between those patients with degenerative or symptomatic discs adjacent to the fusion and those with normal adjacent discs.",

Therefore, a quantitative structure-activity relation (QSAR) analysis was performed to study the relation between structural parameters and the effect of the following VPA metabolites: 4-en-VPA, 2-en-VPA, 3-en-VPA, 2,4'-dien-VPA, 4,4'-dien-VPA, 4-hydroxy-VPA, 3-ceto-VPA, 3-hydroxy-VPA, 5-hydroxy-VPA, and propylglutaric acid. METHODS: By using the CAChe program package for biomolecules (Oxford Molecular, Ltd), we performed molecular modeling. The anticonvulsant activity determined on the threshold for maximal electroconvulsions in mice was obtained from a study of L\u00f6scher and Nau. Structural parameters were compared between metabolites with a double bond and metabolites with oxygen at either side chain (unpaired Student's t test). A single linear regression analysis between each structural parameter and the relative anticonvulsant potency was also performed. RESULTS: Similar parameters were found between the cis and trans and R and S isomers. Biologic activity and most of the structural parameters were significantly different between metabolites with a double bond and metabolites with oxygen at either side chain. Activity was directly related to log P(oct) (r(2) = 0.77) and to reactivity parameters and was inversely related to stability parameters and to molecular weight and surface.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cohort of 102 patients with 149 replants (6 extremities, 143 digits) and a mean age of 41 years (range 5 to 72 years) was enrolled in this study. The data collected included age, gender, tobacco/cigarettes use, trauma mechanism, underlying disease (e.g., hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), etc.), and vein graft use. An analysis with a multivariable regression was conducted to identify the risk factors of replant failure and their respective odds ratios (ORs). RESULTS: Multilevel generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) with a binomial distribution and logit link showed that smoking did not increase the risk of replant failure (p = 0.234). In addition, the survival of replants was not affected by DM or HTN (p = 0.285 and 0.938, respectively). However, the replantation results were significantly affected by the age of the patients and the mechanism of injury. Patients older than 50 years and those with avulsion or crush injuries tended to have a higher risk of replant failure (OR = 2.29, 6.45, and 5.42, respectively; p = 0.047, 0.028, and 0.032, respectively).",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-nine biopsies of enhancing solid renal masses 4 cm or smaller without fat on CT scans were performed under CT fluoroscopic guidance. The growth pattern, interface with parenchyma, presence of a scar and segmental inversion enhancement, unenhanced CT histogram, and pattern and degree of enhancement on triphasic MDCT images were independently evaluated by two radiologists. Biopsy and pathology reports were used as the reference standard, and imaging follow-up of benign lesions was performed for at least 1 year. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the significance of CT criteria in differentiating malignant from benign lesions. RESULTS: Of the 99 lesions, 74 (75%) were malignant at biopsy, and 25 (25%) were benign. Lesions with gradual enhancement were more likely to be benign. No significant correlation was found between other CT features and a malignant or benign diagnosis. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of progressive enhancement for a diagnosis of benignity were 60%, 73%, 43%, and 84%.",

SETTINGS: Public schools, alternative schools and area learning centers. PARTICIPANTS: Of the 78,800 students between the ages of 14 and 18 years who completed the survey, 18,803 reported substance use and at least one substance use disorder diagnostic criterion during the previous 12 months and were used for the analyses. The sample was divided randomly into two groups in order to conduct data analyses on one group (n = 9490) and confirm the findings in the other group (n = 9313). MEASUREMENTS: Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to test three competing factor structure models consisting of a single factor model, a two-factor model of distinct dimensions and a two-factor model with interrelated dimensions. FINDINGS: The single factor and correlated two-factor models had similar parameter estimates and fit the data better than the competing two-factor model with distinct dimensions. Findings were confirmed in a second sample.",

METHODS: Eligible children were first-time patients of clinics participating in the Longitudinal Assessment of Manic Symptoms who were between ages six and 12 and who were English speaking. Children who screened positive for symptoms of mania (N=1,124) were invited to participate, and families of 621 (55%) children consented. A matched sample of 86 children without a positive screen for mania also participated. Baseline interviews assessed sociodemographic characteristics of the child and family and the child's functioning, diagnoses, and use of services. RESULTS: Of the 707 children, 30% were younger, and 50% used multiple types of specialty outpatient services. Younger children were more likely to be male, have Medicaid insurance, and have two parents with mental health problems. Use of multiple types of services was related to study site, high depression scores, fewer minor health issues, and fewer stressful life events among younger children and with parental stress, primary diagnosis, poor functioning, and not living with both parents among older children. Younger children were much more likely than older children to have used services before age six.",

There is also substantial structural and phylogenetic diversity among TEs, such that they can be classified into distinct classes, superfamilies, and families. Possible relationships between TE diversity (and not just abundance) and genome size have not been investigated to date, though there are reasons to expect either a positive or a negative correlation. This study compares data from 257 species of animals, plants, fungi, and \"protists\" to determine whether TE diversity at the superfamily level is related to genome size. RESULTS: No simple relationship was found between TE diversity and genome size. There is no significant correlation across all eukaryotes, but there is a positive correlation for genomes below 500 Mbp and a negative correlation among land plants. No relationships were found across animals or within vertebrates. Some TE superfamilies tend to be present across all major groups of eukaryotes, but there is considerable variance in TE diversity in different taxa.",

One may question, therefore, the routine use of postchemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RLND), especially if the residual masses are less than 20 mm in diameter. To define the role of such surgery, we analyzed the postchemotherapy histology in testicular cancer patients with minimal residual disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-eight patients with advanced nonseminomatous testicular cancer underwent RLND after three to four cycles of cisplatin- or carboplatin-based chemotherapy. In all patients, the largest diameter of the residual retroperitoneal mass was less than 20 mm. RESULTS: Complete fibrosis/necrosis was found in 51 patients, mature teratoma in 22, and vital malignant germ cell tumor in five. In two of the latter five patients, alphafetoprotein (AFP) had increased immediately before RLND. In the 76 patients with normal pre-RLND tumor markers, the presence of undifferentiated malignant teratoma (MTU) in the primary tumor and normal prechemotherapy tumor markers were independent parameters predicting complete fibrosis/necrosis, which was demonstrated in all 15 patients with these two pretreatment parameters.",

Japanese endoscopists use the distal end of the lower esophageal palisade vessels to localize EGJ. In the West, endoscopists use the proximal gastric folds because of concerns that palisade vessels may be difficult to recognize. We evaluated whether there were differences between American and Japanese endoscopists in the recognition of palisade vessels. METHOD: A total of 82 patients were enrolled in this study. Patients were referred for diagnostic esophagogastroduodenoendoscopy (EGD) at the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, from May to July 2008. American and Japanese endoscopists evaluated the EGJ of patients undergoing diagnostic EGD. We analyzed the differences in the recognition of the distal end of palisade vessels. We calculated the kappa statistic to measure interobserver variability. RESULTS: Based on localization using the distal end of the palisade vessels, American and Japanese endoscopists identified the EGJ in 87.8% (72/82) and 89.0% (73/82) of cases, respectively.

METHODS: Seventy-four consecutive patients with refractory frozen shoulder underwent arthroscopic capsular release and were divided into 2 groups randomly. The release of anterior capsular structures, including the anterior band of the IGHL, was performed in group 1. In group 2 the release extended inferiorly and posteriorly. Constant functional scores were used to assess the outcome. The range of motion (ROM) in various directions was also recorded preoperatively and postoperatively. RESULTS: Follow-up was obtained in 41 patients in group 1 and 29 patients in group 2, and it averaged 28 months. At the last follow-up, there was a significant improvement in Constant score (P<.01) postoperatively in all patients. There was a significant and rapid reduction in the visual analog scale score in both groups postoperatively. No statistical difference in the visual analog scale score was found between the 2 groups at the corresponding time points. Overall, patients had restored shoulder ROM at the last follow-up without difference between group 1 and group 2. Abduction, flexion, external rotation at 90 degrees of abduction, internal rotation at 0 degrees of abduction, and internal rotation at 90 degrees of abduction recovered more rapidly in group 2 within 3 months after surgery; however, there was no significant difference in ROM after 6 months.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Few studies have focused on fatigue in myasthenia gravis (MG), and fatigue in relation to the autonomic system has never been systematically explored in these patients. The study aimed to document the prevalence of MG-related fatigue in ethnic Norwegians and to examine whether MG severity is associated with symptoms of autonomic disturbance, which in turn is associated with fatigue and functional disability. METHODS: Eighty two of the 97 who fulfilled the study inclusion criteria participated in the study. Controls were 410 age- and sex-matched subjects drawn from a normative sample (n = 2136) representative of the Norwegian population. Bivariate analyses and multivariate linear regression analyses were used to assess associations between questionnaire-reported MG severity, symptoms of autonomic disturbance, fatigue (mental and physical) and functional disability. RESULTS: Forty-four per cent (36/82) of patients fulfilled the criteria for fatigue compared with 22% (90/410) of controls (odds ratio 2.0; p = 0.003). Twenty-one per cent of patients (17/82) met the criteria for chronic fatigue versus 12% (48/410) of controls (odds ratio 1.96; p = 0.03). MG patients had higher total fatigue scores than controls (p<0.001) and a high prevalence of autonomic symptoms, especially poor thermoregulation and sleep disturbance. According to multivariate analyses controlled for MG score, symptoms of autonomic disturbances were independently positively associated with fatigue (p<0.001), and fatigue was independently negatively associated with functional level (p<0.001).",
        "output": "Yes, fatigue in myasthenia gravis is more than just muscular weakness. It is associated with autonomic symptoms such as poor thermoregulation and sleep disturbance, and is also associated with increased fatigue and decreased functional level."

Physical activity is a primary lifestyle measure required to lower blood pressure in hypertensive patients, and the US Preventative Services Task force (USPSTF) recommends counseling by health care providers to promote regular physical activity. Surveys of patients suggest, however, that few healthcare providers follow the USPSTF recommendation on physical activity counseling. METHOD: This article examined data on the rate of healthcare provider counseling, compliance with recommendations and the blood pressure difference associated with following recommendations to increase physical activity. Data are from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey III 1988-1994 (NHANES-III) of adults with hypertension. We compared the results of compliance with recommendation from the NHANES-III data to five recent clinical trials on physical activity conducted between 1991 and 2001. RESULTS: A third of the NHANES-III hypertensive patients received counseling to engage in physical activity to manage their hypertension, and 71% (n=669) followed the recommendations and had a systolic blood pressure that was an average of approximately equal to 3-4 mm Hg lower than those who did not follow recommendations.",

METHODS: Between October 1995 and March 1998 urine cultures were prospectively obtained in all patients undergoing a primary percutaneous antegrade urinary drainage procedure. One hundred and eighty-seven patients underwent 264 procedures. Results were available in 252 cases. Culture results were correlated with clinical, laboratory, and demographic variables. Anaerobic cultures were not uniformly performed. RESULTS: Urine cultures were positive in 24 of 252 (9.5%) cases. An indwelling or recently removed ipsilateral device (catheter or stent) and a history of previous cystectomy with urinary diversion were significant predictors of a positive culture. Patients without either of these predictors, and without clinical or laboratory evidence of infection, were rarely found to have positive cultures.",

The prevalence of pulmonary embolism (PE) at autopsy in lung-transplant recipients has not been characterized previously. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the prevalence of PE, infection, and acute and chronic rejection at autopsy and their respective contributions to death in lung-transplant recipients according to survival posttransplantation. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 126 autopsy reports performed in lung-and heart-lung-transplant recipients between June 1990 and September 2002. RESULTS: PE was identified at autopsy in 34 (27.0%) of 126 lung- and heart-lung-transplant recipients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 459 men treated with RP with pathological Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer in the SEARCH database. The men were stratified into five groups based on pathological characteristics: group 1, men with negative surgical margins (NSMs) and no ECE; group 2, men with positive surgical margin (PSMs) and no ECE; group 3, men with NSMs and ECE; group 4, men with PSMs and ECE; and group 5, men with SVI. Cox proportional hazards models and the log-rank test were used to compare BCR among the groups. RESULTS: At 2 years after RP, pathological group was significantly correlated with BCR (log-rank, P<0.001) with patients in group 5 (+SVI) having the highest BCR risk (66%) and those in group 1 (NSMs and no ECE) having the lowest risk (14%). When we compared groups 2, 3, and 4, with each other, there was no significant difference in BCR among the groups (~50% 2-year BCR risk; log-rank P = 0.28). Results were similar when adjusting for prostate-specific antigen, age, pathological Gleason sum and clinical stage, or after excluding men who received adjuvant therapy.",

SETTING: Eleven terminal cancer patients (3 pancreas, 4 colon, 4 gastric) suffering from elevated drug resistant visceral pain. DESIGN: The trial program was related to the first ten treatment sessions. Subsequently, each patient continued to receive treatment until death. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain measures were performed using the visual analogue scale before and after each treatment session and accompanied by diary recordings of the duration of analgesia in the hours following each single application. Any variation in pain-killing drug consumption was also recorded. RESULTS: All patients reacted positively to the treatment throughout the whole reference period. Pain intensity showed a significant decrease (P<0.001), accompanied by a gradual rise both in the pain threshold and the duration of analgesia. Nine (81.8%) of the patients suspended pain-killers within the first 5 applications, while the remaining two (18.2%) considerably reduced the dosage taken prior to scrambler therapy. No undesirable side effects were observed. Compliance was found to be optimal.",

SETTING: General Clinical Research Center. PATIENTS: The study sample was comprised of 86 patients (68 men and 18 women) with an average age of 47 years. All were suspected of having obstructive sleep apnea and underwent confirmatory diagnostic polysomnography (respiratory disturbance index>or = 15). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Stroke volume and cardiac output were measured using impedance cardiography and corrected for body surface area to yield stroke index and cardiac index. Daytime sleepiness was quantified using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. A higher Epworth Sleepiness Scale score, suggesting more daytime sleepiness, was significantly related to lower stroke index and cardiac index. In multiple regression analyses, the relationships of Epworth Sleepiness Scale score with both stroke index and cardiac index were significant (p<.05), even after controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, respiratory disturbance index, and mean sleep oxygen saturation.",

METHODS: SDRA focuses on individual time and diameter responses, taking into account the fluctuation in baseline diameter, providing improved insight into reaction patterns when compared with established methods as delivered by retinal vessel analyzer (RVA) software. SDRA patterns were developed with measurements from 78 healthy nonsmokers and subsequently validated in a group of 21 otherwise healthy smokers. Fundus photography and retinal vessel responses were assessed by RVA, intraocular pressure by contact tonometry, and blood pressure by sphygmomanometry. RESULTS: Compared with the RVA software method, SDRA demonstrated a marked difference in retinal vessel responses to flickering light (P<0.05). As a validation of that finding, SDRA showed a strong relation between baseline retinal vessel diameter and subsequent dilatory response in both healthy subjects and smokers (P = 0.001). The RVA software was unable to detect this difference or to find a difference in retinal vessel arteriovenous ratio between smokers and nonsmokers (P = 0.243). However, SDRA revealed that smokers' vessels showed both an increased level of arterial baseline diameter fluctuation before flicker stimulation (P = 0.005) and an increased stiffness of retinal arterioles (P = 0.035) compared with those in nonsmokers. These differences were unrelated to intraocular pressure or systemic blood pressure.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: This prospective study examined the appropriate use of colonoscopy in an open-access system with the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines and determined whether the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines were associated with relevant endoscopic findings. METHODS: In a cohort of 2221 consecutive patients referred for colonoscopy, the proportion of patients who underwent colonoscopy for appropriate indications was prospectively assessed. The relationship between appropriateness and the presence of clinically relevant endoscopic diagnoses was assessed by calculating (1) the positive and negative likelihood ratio of the indications; and (2) the change in the probability of relevant endoscopic diagnoses in the presence of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy criteria. RESULTS: The rate for 'generally not indicated' colonoscopies was 37%. Relevant endoscopic diagnoses were present in 28.5% of cases with American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy indications versus 20.1% of patients without appropriate indications. However, the risk of finding relevant diagnoses was significantly increased by American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy criteria application (odds ratio (OR) 1.58; 99% CI 1.20-2.07; p<0.01). Furthermore, in both endoscopic situations (appropriate and not appropriate), the likelihood ratio, positive and negative, varied very little, suggesting a low predictivity for serious pathologies by the appropriate procedure.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Many approaches have been considered to reduce heart failure (HF) readmissions. The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations (JC) requires hospitals to provide patients admitted for HF with discharge instructions that address 6 topics related to HF management: diet, exercise, weight monitoring, worsening symptoms, medications, and follow-up appointments. These guidelines were developed based on expert opinion, but no one has tested whether patients' understanding of these instructions affects 30-day readmission rates. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of patients admitted for decompensated HF. Patients completed an understanding survey immediately after their nurse read their discharge papers. The survey contained 1 question for each of the 6 JC topics. Of the 145 patients in the study, only 14 (10%) understood all 6 discharge instructions. Patients with complete comprehension of their discharge instructions were significantly less likely to be readmitted within 30 days than those with nonperfect understanding (P\u00a0= .044), but this association was no longer significant after controlling for level of education and use of English as a primary language.",

METHODS: All the African cases detected in Barcelona between 1989 and 2007 were investigated in a retrospective analysis. Clinical-epidemiological variables such as sex, age, visiting friends and relatives (VFR), species, hospital admission and chemo-prophylaxis were compared. Data were analysed by logistic regression, calculating the Odds Ratio (OR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: Of the 489 African patients, 279 (57,1%) had been born in EG and 210 (42,9%) in the rest of Africa. The cumulative incidence of imported malaria among those from EG was 179.6 per thousand inhabitants, while in those from the RA it was 33.7 per thousand (p<0.001). Compliance with chemoprophylaxis (CP) was very low, but there were no differences between the two groups. Comparing those from EG to those from RA, the former were characterized by having more patients in the visiting friends and relatives (VFR) category, and more individuals younger than 15 years or older than 37 years, and more women.

If urodynamic investigations were to be valuable in the diagnostic work-up, patients with normal and abnormal findings would have different treatment results. Our policy to never combine prolapse surgery and stress-incontinence surgery allowed us to study whether incontinence after surgery can be predicted from urodynamic investigation results. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in consecutive patients undergoing vaginal prolapse surgery (anterior colporraphy and/or posterior colporraphy, and/or vaginal hysterectomy) between 2002 and 2004. All patients underwent pre-operative urodynamic investigation, including filling cystometry, urethral pressure profile measurement, and free flow cystometry.

        "input": "PURPOSE: The most widely accepted classification for endometriosis is the Revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine (rASRM) system, but this does not take deeply infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) into account. The Enzian classification enables clinicians to classify DIE. Due to complexity and partial overlap with rASRM, it was revised for a second time in February 2011. Using both the systems to classify lesions would be inappropriate, as they refer to different locations. The aim of this study was to analyze whether the revised Enzian classification is easier to use and avoids duplicate classifications. METHODS: Retrospective study of 460 women admitted for endometriosis. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-seven of 460 patients (41\u00a0%) had histologically confirmed DIE based on the revised Enzian classification. Further classification of these 187 patients using Enzian revealed 270 retroperitoneal lesions, as some patients had several DIE-type lesions simultaneously: 66 in compartment A (rectovaginal septum, vagina), 112 in compartment B (sacrouterine ligaments, pelvic wall), 58 in compartment C (bowel), 15 with adenomyosis uteri, 7 with bladder involvement, 8 with intrinsic involvement of the ureter, and 4 with bowel involvement. All 270 lesions were classified using Enzian alone and not with the rASRM score. There were no duplicate classifications (rASRM and Enzian).",
        "output": "The revised Enzian classification is easier to use and avoids duplicate classifications compared to the rASRM system. It classifies DIE more accurately and precisely than the rASRM system, as it takes into account the location of the lesion. The revised Enzian classification is more comprehensive and reliable than the rASRM system."

        "input": "INTRODUCTION: Studies investigating genetic risk factors for susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) studied anti-citrullinated peptide antibody (CCP)-positive RA more frequently than anti-CCP-negative RA. One of the reasons for this is the perception that anti-CCP-negative RA may include patients that fulfilled criteria for RA but belong to a wide range of diagnoses. We aimed to evaluate the validity of this notion and explored whether clinical subphenotypes can be discerned within anti-CCP-negative RA. METHODS: The 318 patients with anti-CCP-negative RA (1987 ACR criteria), included in the Leiden Early Arthritis Clinic between 1993 and 2006, were studied for baseline characteristics and radiologic progression data during a mean follow-up of 5 years. Grouping was studied both at variable and patient levels. Principal components analysis and partial least-squares regression were applied to study for clustering of variables. A cluster analysis was performed to look for clustering of patients. RESULTS: The simultaneous presence of patient characteristics at disease presentation was observed for several groups; however, the three largest groups of patients' characteristics explained only 26.5% of the total variance. Plotting the contribution of each patient to these three groups did not reveal clustering of patients. Comparable observations were made when data on progression of joint destruction were studied in relation to baseline clinical data. A cluster analysis, evaluating whether patients resemble each other, revealed no grouping of patients. Altogether, no clinically distinguishable subphenotypes were observed.",

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We randomly selected weeks between August 2012 and May 2013 when donors were offered HIV counseling and testing (n\u00a0=\u00a06298), leaving usual procedure weeks as control (n\u00a0=\u00a05569). RESULTS: Few candidate donors chose HIV testing (n\u00a0=\u00a081, 1.3%). There was no significant difference in herpes simplex virus Type 2 (HSV-2) prevalence (a marker of sexual risk) among donors during intervention weeks compared to control (10.4% vs. 11.1%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.245).

Recently, there has been an increasing research focus in this field on the earliest years of life, however, relatively few studies have addressed the role of fathers, despite this appearing to be particularly pertinent to child behavioural development. This study aimed to examine whether father-infant interactions at age 3\u2003months independently predicted child behavioural problems at 1\u2003year of age. METHOD: A sample of 192 families was recruited from two maternity units in the United Kingdom. Father-infant interactions were assessed in the family home and coded using the global rating scales. Child behaviour problems were assessed by maternal report. Hierarchical and logistic regression analyses were used to examine associations between father-infant interaction and the development of behavioural problems. RESULTS: Disengaged and remote interactions between fathers and their infants were found to predict externalising behavioural problems at the age of 1\u2003year. The children of the most disengaged fathers had an increased risk of developing early externalising behavioural problems [disengaged (nonintrusive) interactions--adjusted odds ratio 5.33 (95% confidence interval; 1.39, 20.40): remote interactions adj.

DESIGN: This study included 9631 men and 3595 women participating in the French GAZEL cohort. Social relations (social networks, personal social support, and social relations satisfaction) were measured in 1994 by self report. Psychosocial work characteristics (decision latitude, psychological demands, and social support at work) were ascertained in 1995. Sickness absence data were collected independently. The authors studied the incidence of short (>7 days), intermediate (7-21 days), and long (>21 days) spells of absence from 1995 to 31 December 2001. Rate ratios associated with psychosocial exposures, adjusted on sociodemographic characteristics, and health behaviours, were calculated by means of log-linear Poisson regression. SETTING: A cohort of 20000 employees of France's national gas and electricity company (the GAZEL study). MAIN RESULTS: Among men and women, levels of decision latitude and personal social support below the median predicted 17% to 24% increases in absence rates. Low satisfaction with social relations and low social support at work lead to a 10% to 26% excess in sick leaves among men. No interactive effects were found between the variables under study.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten dogs were exposed to open right nephrectomy to create a solitary kidney model (group 1). Ten dogs with both kidneys were considered group 2. All dogs underwent warm ischemia by open occlusion of the left renal artery for 90 minutes. Dogs were sacrificed at different intervals (3 days to 4 weeks). All dogs were reevaluated by renogram before sacrifice and histopathology of the investigated kidney. The proinflammatory markers CD95 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 were assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: In group 1 clearance decreased by 20% at 1 week but basal function was regained starting at week 2. In group 2 clearance decreased more than 90% up to week 2. Recovery started at week 3 and by 4 weeks there was a 23% clearance reduction. Histopathological examination in group 1 revealed significant tubular necrosis (60%) at 3 days with regeneration starting at 1 week. In group 2 there was more pronounced tubular necrosis (90%) with regeneration starting at 2 weeks. The expression of proinflammatory markers was up-regulated in each group with higher, more sustained expression in group 2.",

STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional comparison of cesarean section rates and health maintenance organization (HMO) market penetration in 61 selected metropolitan areas in the United States was conducted. National birth certificate data for 1996 were used to calculate crude and race-adjusted cesarean section rates for residents in each area. RESULTS: No relationship between overall cesarean section rates in the metropolitan areas and managed care penetration was observed. Subanalyses of racial groups demonstrated the existence of a weak association between managed care penetration and cesarean section rates for white women (21.2% for the highest quartile of HMO penetration, compared with 19.1% for the lowest quartile; P = .03), but not for African-Americans or other minorities.",

The influence of personal value priorities on discrimination has been investigated in several contexts, but seldom with reference to social distance towards those with mental illness. METHOD: University students (n = 200) completed the Schwartz Value Scale, as well as a measure of beliefs about mental illness and preferred social distance with reference to a vignette describing a person with either schizophrenia or depression. RESULTS: Consistent with past findings, respondents indicated a preference for greater social distance for schizophrenia than depression, and beliefs about likelihood of socially inappropriate behaviour and danger were correlated with social distance. Self-transcendence value orientation was a significant independent predictor of preference for less social distance. These findings were not influenced by a social desirability bias.",

Using postcode sector data for Scotland (UK), this study tests the hypothesis of spatial heterogeneity in the relationship between area-level deprivation and mortality to determine if contextual differences in the West vs. the rest of Scotland influence this relationship. Research into health inequalities frequently fails to recognise spatial heterogeneity in the deprivation-health relationship, assuming that global relationships apply uniformly across geographical areas. In this study, exploratory spatial data analysis methods are used to assess local patterns in deprivation and mortality. Spatial regression models are then implemented to examine the relationship between deprivation and mortality more formally. RESULTS: The initial exploratory spatial data analysis reveals concentrations of high standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and deprivation (hotspots) in the West of Scotland and concentrations of low values (coldspots) for both variables in the rest of the country. The main spatial regression result is that deprivation is the only variable that is highly significantly correlated with all-cause mortality in all models. However, in contrast to the expected spatial heterogeneity in the deprivation-mortality relationship, this relation does not vary between regions in any of the models. This result is robust to a number of specifications, including weighting for population size, controlling for spatial autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity, assuming a non-linear relationship between mortality and socio-economic deprivation, separating the dependent variable into male and female SMRs, and distinguishing between West, North and Southeast regions. The rejection of the hypothesis of spatial heterogeneity in the relationship between socio-economic deprivation and mortality complements prior research on the stability of the deprivation-mortality relationship over time.",

Because the mortality rate of untreated fetuses with CCAM and hydrops is high, early delivery or intrauterine resection of the enlarged pulmonary lobe (lobectomy) is indicated; however, open fetal resection of CCAM at less than 30 weeks is associated with perioperative mortality that approaches 40%, as well as the usual maternal and fetal morbidity of open fetal surgery. As an alternative, percutaneous laser ablation of a CCAM III lesion with hydrops was attempted. METHODS: A 30-year-old G3 P1011 with CCAM III in the left fetal hemithorax developed mediastinal shift, hydrops and polyhydramnios at 23 weeks' gestation. After pregnancy termination and open fetal resection were declined, an 18-gauge needle was placed into the fetal tumor percutaneously under real-time ultrasonographic guidance, using sterile technique with light sedation. A cleaved 400-microm Nd:YAG laser fiber was passed through the needle lumen, and using a power setting of 15 W, a total of 2,943 J of laser energy was delivered in pulses of 1.0 s at 0.2-second intervals over two sessions one week apart.

An additional orthopaedic trauma subspecialist was blinded to treating surgeon and adjudicated healing at 18 weeks. The Squared-Error Skill Score (SESS) determined the likelihood of accurate forecasting for bony union. RESULTS: Nine patients were lost follow-up, resulting in 39 fractures (81.25% retention) including 20 femoral and 19 tibial fractures. Fourteen fractures were open, 15 were not-yet united at final follow-up. SESS values were 0.25-0.77. The ability to predict union (sensitivity) was 1.000. The ability to predict nonunions (specificity) was 0.330-0.500. The probability of a correct predicted union was 0.727 and correct predicted nonunion at final follow-up was 1.000.

Studies were conducted to determine the relevance of reperfusion injury in the juvenile pig, whose low levels of xanthine oxidase are similar to those of the human being. METHODS: Ischemia was induced by means of complete mesenteric arterial occlusion, volvulus, or hemorrhagic shock. Injury was assessed by means of histologic examination and measurement of lipid peroxidation. In addition, myeloperoxidase, as a marker of neutrophil infiltration, and xanthine oxidase-xanthine dehydrogenase were measured. RESULTS: Significant ischemic injury was evident after 0.5 to 3 hours of complete mesenteric occlusion or 2 hours of shock or volvulus. In none of these models was the ischemic injury worsened by reperfusion. To maximize superoxide production, pigs were ventilated on 100% O2, but only limited reperfusion injury (1.2-fold increase in histologic grade) was noted. Xanthine oxidase-xanthine dehydrogenase levels were negligible (0.4 +/- 0.4 mU/gm).",

METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent unilateral lung contusion (LC) followed by HS for 45\u00a0minutes. After resuscitation, animals were injected with a selective beta-blocker, atenolol (B1B), butoxamine (B2B), or SR59230A (B3B). Animals were killed at 3 hours or 7 days. Heart rate and blood pressure were measured throughout the study period. BM cellularity, growth of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) in BM, and hemoglobin levels (Hb) were assessed. RESULTS: Treatment with a B2B or B3B after LCHS restored both BM cellularity and BM HPC colony growth at 3 hours and 7 days. In contrast, treatment with a B1B had no effect on BM cellularity or HPC growth but did decrease heart effectively rate throughout the study. Treatment with a B3B after LCHS increased Hb as compared with LCHS alone.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: This study evaluated whether an objective tool would provide a more reliable and valid assessment of perioperative risk compared with the ASA-physical status (ASA-PS) in children. METHODS: A system-based risk assessment tool was developed using these categories: Neurological, Airway, Respiratory, Cardiovascular, and Other (NARCO) with a subcomponent grading surgical severity (SS). Anaesthesiologists reviewed the preoperative assessments and assigned NARCO, SS, and ASA-PS scores independently. Perioperative outcomes were recorded by trained observers. Validity and reliability of the tools were evaluated. RESULTS: NARCO correlated with ASA-PS (\u03c1=0.664; P<0.01) supporting its criterion validity. Inter-rater reliability of the measures was supported (intraclass correlation coefficients 0.71-0.96; \u03ba 0.43-0.87) except for the Airway category. Measures of exact agreement were slightly better for NARCO compared with ASA-PS. NARCO, SS, and ASA-PS scores correlated significantly with perioperative escalation of care, adverse events (AE), hospital length of stay, and admission status. Correlations between NARCO and ASA-PS and outcomes improved when SS was factored into their coding. There were significant, but low, correlations between all measures and mortality. The odds of having escalation of care, AE, and mortality were 5-47 times greater among children with higher risk scores.",
        "output": "Yes, an objective system-based approach to assessing perioperative risk in children appears to provide a more reliable and valid assessment than the ASA-PS. The NARCO system correlated strongly with the ASA-PS and had higher inter-rater reliability than the ASA-PS. The NARCO system also had stronger correlations with perioperative outcomes such as escalation of care, adverse events, and mortality than the ASA-PS."

DATA SOURCES: County-level data describing the supply of physicians, mortality, and socioeconomic conditions of the population as provided in the Area Resource File (BHPr, HRSA) and the Compressed Mortality File (NCHS, CDC). STUDY DESIGN: Ordinary least squares and geographically weighted regression models with age-adjusted all-cause and disease-specific mortality as the dependent variables were specified using pooled data from 1996 to 2000 to test for the relationship with primary care and specialist physician-population ratios. The residuals from the OLS models were mapped and examined for potential clustering. A series of geographically weighted regression models were run for all 3,070 counties and the z-scores and significance of the models mapped. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The association between primary care physician supply and mortality was not observed in contrast to other studies; mapping the residuals of those models suggested regional clustering. When weighted geographically, the relationship between primary care and specialist physician supply and mortality presents a mixed pattern. The results show strong regional patterns that may explain the lack of a consistent national association. Primary care physicians are associated with decreased mortality on the east coast and upper midwest, but that correlation disappears or is reversed in the west (with the exception of Washington State) and south central states.",

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we used retrospectively collected data from all patients admitted to all ICUs in British Columbia between April 01, 1994, and March 31, 1999, or to 20 ICUs in Ontario during 2002. We used responses to a survey about organizational factors for all ICUs in British Columbia and Ontario that was done in 2001. Clustered data regression models were used to assess the influence of organizational factors on outcomes after adjustment for patient-level confounders. RESULTS: Despite adjustment for age, sex, comorbidity score of patients, and limitation of the data sets to minimize confounding, we found variable relationships between ICU outcomes (hospital mortality, ICU length of stay, and hospital length of stay) and any of \"closed\" administrative model, daily rounds, presence of an ICU medical director, medical director trained in critical care medicine, presence of a nurse leader in the ICU, nurse-patient ratio, and presence of an ICU pharmacist. Closed administrative model was associated with lower hospital mortality (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.75 [0.66-0.85]), shorter length of ICU stay (rate ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.76 [0.62-0.92]), and shorter length of hospital stay (rate ratio [5% confidence interval]: 0.78 [0.72-0.84]) in nontertiary ICUs but many other \"advantageous\" factors were associated with higher mortality.",

We studied, prospectively, the association of EBV and vitamin D status with the risk of pregnancy-associated breast cancer (PABC), breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy or 1 year post-partum, using a nested case-control study. METHODS: Serum vitamin D and antibodies to EBV were measured for 108 PABC cases of the Finnish Maternity Cohort, and 208 controls matched for date of birth, date of sampling and parity. The joint effect of vitamin D and EBV on the risk of PABC was evaluated. RESULTS: EBV seropositivity was generally not associated with the risk of PABC. Among individuals with sufficient (\u226575 nmol/l) levels of vitamin D, we, however, found similar increased risk estimates for PABC associated with serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to EBV early antigens [odds ratio (OR)=7.7, 95% (confidence interval) CI 1.4-42.3]and the viral reactivator protein, ZEBRA (OR=7.8, 95% CI 1.1-61.2).",

The purpose of the study was to examine the effects of physical activity on the association between neighborhood social cohesion and depressive symptoms. METHODS: Multivariate logistic regression tested the moderation of self-reported leisure-time moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (LTMVPA) and active use of parks or recreational facilities on the association between neighborhood social cohesion and depressive symptoms among 295 randomly selected Latino adults who completed a face-to-face interview. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, gender, and income, neighborhood social cohesion and depressive symptoms were inversely related (OR = 0.8; 95% CI: 0.5-1.2). Active use of parks or recreational facilities moderated the association between neighborhood social cohesion and depressive symptoms but meeting the recommendations for LTMVPA did not. Latinos who reported active use of parks or recreational facilities and higher levels of neighborhood social cohesion had fewer depressive symptoms than peers who did not use these spaces.",

Persons with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus either as an underlying or contributing cause of death were considered cases. Referents were decedents without any indication of cancer, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes. RESULTS: A slightly elevated risk [Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (MH-OR) 1.2, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.82-1.8] was found for diabetes mellitus among the glassworks employees, especially in combination with cardiovascular disease (MH-OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.81-2.3). For the glassblowers, other foundry workers and unspecified glassworkers probably exposed to arsenic, the M-H odds ratio was 1.4 (95% CI 0.92-2.2). Unspecified glass workers, who probably included persons with high exposure, carried the higher risk (MH-OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.8).",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Surgical excision of gastrinomas in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) decreases the incidence of hepatic metastases, but long-term biochemical cures are achieved in fewer than 30% of cases. A growing number of patients have persistent or recurrent disease after initial operation. The effect of reoperation in these patients has not been previously reported. METHODS: From December 1982 to August 1995, 120 patients with ZES underwent operation for gastrinoma resection. Seventy-eight patients had recurrent or persistent ZES after operation; 17 patients underwent 18 reoperations. After initial operation all patients underwent yearly functional and imaging studies. If a tumor was unequivocally imaged, reexploration was done. RESULTS: Five patients, all with sporadic disease, were disease free after operation, with a median follow-up of 28 months. Tumor was found in all 18 reoperations and resected in 17. In patients with continuing disease-free intervals, locations of gastrinomas included pancreatic head lymph nodes (three), liver metastasis (one), and pancreatic tail lymph node (one). There were no deaths in the cured group; two patients in the group with persistent disease have died (median follow-up, 34 months).",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: The Ghana Community based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) strategy targets to bring health services to the doorsteps of clients in a manner that improves maternal and child health outcomes. In this strategy, referral is an important component but it is threatened in a rural context where transportation service is a problem. Few studies have examined perceptions of rural dwellers on transportation challenges in accessing maternal health care services within CHPS. METHODS: Using the political ecology of health framework, this paper investigates transportation barriers in health access in a rural context based on perceived cause, coping mechanisms and strategies for a sustainable transportation system. Eight (8) focus group discussions involving males (n\u2009=\u200940) and females (n\u2009=\u200945) in rural communities in a CHPS zone in the Upper West Region of Ghana were conducted between September and December 2013. RESULTS: Lack of vehicular transport is suppressing the potential positive impact of CHPS on maternal and child health. Consistent neglect of road infrastructural development and endemic poverty in the study area makes provision of alternative transport services for health care difficult. As a result, pregnant women use risky methods such as bicycle/tricycle/motorbikes to access obstetric health care services, and some turn to traditional medicines and traditional birth attendants for maternal health care services.",

OBJECTIVES: In this subanalysis, we sought to evaluate gender differences in the effect of these different strategies. METHODS: The patients (749 women and 1,708 men) were randomized to early invasive or noninvasive strategies. Coronary angiography was performed within the first 7 days in 96% and 10% of the invasive and noninvasive groups, respectively, and revascularization was performed within the first 10 days in 71% and 9% of the invasive and noninvasive groups, respectively. RESULTS: Women presenting with unstable CAD were older, but fewer had previous infarctions, left ventricular dysfunction and elevated troponin T levels. Women had fewer angiographic changes. There was no difference in MI or death at 12 months among women in the invasive and noninvasive groups (12.4% vs. 10.5%, respectively), in contrast to the favorable effect in the invasively treated group of men (9.6% vs. 15.8%, p<0.001).

RESULTS: After a progestagen withdrawal bleeding, patients were randomised for either metformin (n = 11) or placebo (n = 9) treatment. In cases of absent ovulation, exogenous FSH was subsequently administered to induce ovulation. Only during metformin treatment did body mass index and androgen (androstenedione and testosterone) levels decrease, whereas FSH and LH levels increased significantly. In the metformin group, a single patient ovulated before the initiation of exogenous FSH.

STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed the records for all VLBW (birth weight (BW)<or = 1500 gm) infants who were admitted to our nursery within the first 3 days of life between January 1991 and December 1994 and discharged alive. RESULTS: These infants received an average of 2.02 transfusions, far fewer than the 7 to 11 previously reported for VLBW infants. Infants with a BW of 1251 to 1500 gm received very few transfusions. More than three quarters of transfused infants received a transfusion in the first 2 weeks of life before r-HuEPO would be expected to be effective. Assigning units to individual infants and holding the units for 14 days, a practice adopted in our blood bank in 1993, resulted in a 44% decrease in donor exposures in infants receiving more than one transfusion. Holding assigned units for 30 days, a practice our blood bank has now adopted, should result in 56% of all transfused infants having a single donor exposure and 89% having one or two donor exposures. Cost-benefit analysis only supports routine use of r-HuEPO in infants weighing less than 750 gm.",
        "output": "The results of this study suggest that r-HuEPO may be beneficial for VLBW infants with a birth weight of 1251-1500 grams, as they receive fewer transfusions than previously reported for VLBW infants. Furthermore, the practice of holding units of blood for 14 days and 30 days, respectively, has been adopted by the blood bank, which may reduce the number of donor exposures for these infants.

Quality management including benchmarkings yields considerable variations between different hospitals. However, an enduring and significant decrease in the frequency and duration of such coercive measures so far has not been achieved by means of quality management. A new set of approaches is therefore required. RESULTS: Amending the British practice of \"physical restraint\" for German conditions, a technique of holding the patient was developed accompanied by manualised interventions of verbal de-escalation. In contrast to mechanical restraint, the technique represents a therapeutic intervention and is usually of short duration. An implementation is planned in a group of hospitals collaborating in the prevention of violence and coercion in psychiatry.",

Unfortunately, the complication rate with tissue-expander reconstruction is very high. One potential alternative to reduce these complications and improve recovery time is to place the tissue expanders endoscopically. The authors hypothesize that endoscopic placement of tissue expanders will reduce the complication rate, operative time, and time to full expansion. METHODS: Sixty-nine patients have undergone 81 surgical procedures for placement of 202 tissue expanders over the past 8 years at the University of Michigan Health System. The charts for all patients were reviewed retrospectively and the data analyzed to evaluate outcomes following open and endoscopic tissue-expander placement. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients underwent open placement of 127 tissue expanders for reconstruction, whereas 18 patients underwent endoscopic placement of 75 expanders. The average operative time for placement of each expander was significantly reduced in the endoscopic group (34.0 minutes) compared with the open group (49.2 minutes) (p<0.0001). The major complication rate per tissue expander was also reduced in the endoscopically placed expander group (2.7 percent) compared with the open group (22.0 percent) (p = 0.0000056). Time to full expansion and length of hospital stay were also significantly reduced in the endoscopic group (p<0.05 and p<0.005, respectively).",
        "output": "Endoscopic placement of tissue expanders appears to be associated with a lower complication rate, shorter operative time, and faster time to full expansion compared with open placement.

This study examines the impact of receiving feedback via performance benchmarks on medical students' self-assessment after a clinical performance examination (CPX). METHODS: The authors developed a practice-based learning exercise at 3 institutions following a required 8-station CPX for medical students at the end of Year 3. Standardised patients (SPs) scored students after each station using checklists developed by experts. Students assessed their own performance immediately after the CPX (Phase 1). One month later, students watched their videotaped performance and reassessed (Phase 2). Some students received performance benchmarks (their scores, plus normative class data) before the video review. Pearson's correlations between self-ratings and SP ratings were calculated for overall performance and specific skill areas (history taking, physical examination, doctor-patient communication) for Phase 1 and Phase 2. The 2 correlations were then compared for each student group (i.e. those who received and those who did not receive feedback). RESULTS: A total of 280 students completed both study phases. Mean CPX scores ranged from 51% to 71% of items correct overall and for each skill area. Phase 1 self-assessment correlated weakly with SP ratings of student performance (r = 0.01-0.16). Without feedback, Phase 2 correlations remained weak (r = 0.13-0.18; n = 109). With feedback, Phase 2 correlations improved significantly (r = 0.26-0.47; n = 171). Low-performing students showed the greatest improvement after receiving feedback.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: There are few reports that demonstrate the chronologic changes in the functional integrity of the internal thoracic artery (ITA) wall after skeletonization. We investigated the impact of skeletonization on ITA wall integrity by immunohistochemical analyses in acute and chronic phases. METHODS: Nine mongrel dogs underwent bilateral ITA dissection with one skeletonized vessel and the other pedicled. The following studies were performed 1 week (acute phase, n = 3) and 12 weeks (chronic phase, n = 6) after ITA harvesting. All specimens of the ITAs were stained by antibodies against von Willebrand Factor (VWF), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). After observation with confocal laser scanning microscopy, quantitative analyses of the staining signal for VWF and eNOS expressed on endothelial cells were performed. RESULTS: There were significantly more microvessels positive for VWF in the adventitia of skeletonized ITAs than in the adventitia of pedicled ITAs but the expression of PCNA in both groups was minimal, as in normal vessels. iNOS was not detected in any specimen. The intensity of VWF and eNOS expressed by endothelial cells had no significant differences between groups at either phase.",

The aim of this study was, firstly, to examine whether income is independently associated with health, secondly, to assess the extent to which this association reflects high levels of deprivation in low income groups, and thirdly, to examine which specific components of deprivation contribute most to the link between income and health. Health indicators used were the prevalence of chronic conditions, health complaints and less than \"good\" perceived general health. SETTING: Region in the south east of the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: A population of 2567 men and women who participated in an oral interview, aged 15-74. DESIGN: Data were obtained from the baseline of a prospective cohort study aimed at the explanation of socioeconomic inequalities in health. RESULTS: Large inequalities in health by (equivalent) income after differences in other socioeconomic indicators had been controlled for were observed. For example, among those in the lowest income group the risk of bad perceived health was three times as high as among people in the highest income group. The prevalence of deprivation (basic, housing, social) increased with decreasing income to approximately 50-60% in the lowest income group. A substantial part of the increased health risks of the lowest income groups could statistically be accounted for by the higher prevalence of deprivation in these groups. The components that are likely to influence health indirectly, through a psychological or behavioural mechanism, accounted for most of the effect.",

Very little guidance about which behavioral interventions and outcomes merit AC is available in the literature. The primary aim of the present study is to demonstrate a scenario in which use of AC in a behavioral randomized trial was unnecessary and possibly detrimental. METHODS: Exploratory analyses were performed in a randomized controlled trial that tested whether a patient-centered counseling intervention reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in 355 participants with peripheral arterial disease, compared with AC and usual care (UC) conditions. The patient-centered counseling intervention was designed to activate participants to ask their physician for lipid-lowering medication and/or increase dose intensity, increase medication adherence, and reduce fat intake. The AC condition involved attention-matched telephone-delivered health education, and the UC condition consisted of an educational pamphlet. RESULTS: At 12-month follow-up, the mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol changes were -11.1 and -6.8 mg/dL in the UC and AC conditions, respectively (p=.17). The proportion of participants who increased the use or dose intensity of medication was significantly lower in AC than in UC: 17.5% versus 30.5% (p=.03).

The COP and ankle displacements were measured through a force platform and a biaxial electrogoniometer, respectively, during 60\u00a0s in each task. Global posturographic parameters were computed in the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions. In addition, the standard deviation and mean frequency of the ankle movements were also calculated in the sagittal plane. RESULTS: The sway area and standard deviation of COP differed between conditions, wherein smaller and higher values were typically observed during the internal and external feedback, respectively. Conversely, both the mean frequency and the mean velocity of COP were greater during internal feedback compared with other tasks, while external feedback usually leads to smaller values. Additionally, smaller and higher values for the ankle standard deviation and the ankle mean frequency, respectively, were observed during internal feedback, with the external feedback condition showing an opposite behavior.",

        "input": "AIMS: There is evidence suggesting that the respiratory response to sedation is different in patients with sleep apnoea, which is common in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF). This study examined the respiratory response of sedation with propofol and alfentanil, whose pharmacokinetics are not affected by the renal function, in CRF patients. METHODS: Chronic renal failure patients who underwent arteriovenous-fistular surgery (CRF group) and patients who underwent chemoport insertion (control group) were enrolled in this study. Sedation was induced by infusing propofol 1.5 micro/ml and alfentanil 0.2 micro/kg/min continuously in both groups. In the desaturation study, the respiratory rate and peripheral oxygen saturation in room air were checked. In the apnoea-hypopnoea study, the patient's sedation (Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation) score, apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) was recorded using a portable ventilation effort recorder (microMesam) while applying 5 l/min of oxygen through a facial mask. RESULTS: The desaturation event was more common (21.5/h vs. 2/h, p = 0.001) in the CRF patients. Apnoea and hypopnoea (AHI: 13.0 vs. 1.6, p = 0.012, per cent of patients with an AHI>5: 53.3% vs. 7.1%, p = 0.014) occurred more frequently in the CRF patients but the sedation score was not different.",

METHODS: We reviewed data from children aged 3 to 36 months with extreme leukocytosis, fever and the risk of serious bacterial infections (SBI) at our institution from July 2010 to December 2012, a period after the universal introduction of pneumococcal vaccine. RESULTS: Serious bacterial infection was recorded in 57 (39%) of the 147 infants. The most common SBI were segmental or lobar pneumonia, in 28 (19%) patients, and urinary tract infection in 16 (10.9%) patients. Three patients had positive blood cultures, corresponding to a bacteremia rate of 2%. C-reactive protein was significantly higher in the SBI group than in the non-SBI group.",

Many managers in these settings are reluctant to increase availability of healthy food options because they perceive that healthy foods are not profitable. This study assessed the independent contribution of increased availability of healthy foods to their sales in a community sport, commercial context. Change in revenues per patron was also examined. METHODS: The availability of healthy items was increased from 9.1% at baseline (35 days) to 25.0% during the intervention period (40 days), returning to 9.1% postintervention (6 days). Purchases of all patrons who bought foods/beverages (n=17,262 items sold) from two concessions at an outdoor community pool were assessed from baseline to postintervention. Chi-square analyses assessed differences in the proportion of healthy and unhealthy items sold, as well as in the proportion of total revenues per patron across periods. A trained observer also recorded qualitative observations pertaining to a subset of patrons' (n=221) dietary behaviors and activities. RESULTS: Healthy items represented 7.7%, 22.7%, and 9.8% of sales during the preintervention, intervention, and postintervention periods, respectively (p<0.01). Sales of healthy beverages exceeded sales of all other product types. The proportion of total revenues per patron did not differ by period.",

However, their effects on alveolar bone are not well established. The objective of this study was to measure the alveolar bone mineral density (BMD) of HIV-infected patients, with and without antiretroviral therapy (ART), in comparison with that of HIV-free individuals, and to determine factors associated with the BMD of alveolar bone. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed in non-HIV-infected individuals and HIV-infected individuals, with and without ART. Medical status and clinical data were recorded. Periapical radiographs of maxillary and mandibular right premolars were analysed for changes of alveolar BMD based on HIV/ART status. Other factors associated with the changes of alveolar BMD were explored using a parametric multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). RESULTS: One-hundred and one HIV-infected individuals receiving ART (age range: 23-57 years; median age 39 years), 58 receiving no ART (age range: 20-59 years; median age 34 years) and 50 HIV-negative individuals (age range: 19-59 years; median age 36 years) were enrolled.

A survey was performed, to evaluate such complications. METHODS: 145 pacemaker specialists worldwide were asked about their pacemaker experience and arrhythmia induction due to asynchronous stimulation. RESULTS: 102/145 physicians (70 %) answered. Pacing experience: 3 - 40 y, mean 20 +/- 8 y, cumulative 1,974 y. Pacemaker follow-ups: 50 - 12,000/y, mean 2,326 +/- 2,082, overall 230,305/y. No data: 3. Arrhythmia induction was reported by 34/102 physicians (33 %) in 48 cases. 23 cases were major complications: In 13 pts VT or VF was induced. 4 of these had an ejection fraction<30 %, one patient died. 10 additional cases without detailed information were included. 4 of these occurred 15 to 20 years ago. No case occurred in the last 7 years. 25 events were induced secondary, or clinically not relevant: 14 cases had asymptomatic PVCs or short runs. 5 cases 20 - 25 years ago, were due to anodal stimulation. 5 events happened during acute myocardial ischemia or electrolyte imbalance immediately after cardiac surgery. One patient had spontaneous VTs as well.",

For a long time, the tumorigenic potential of smoking was attributed to compounds other than nicotine. However, more recently data have accumulated which suggest that nicotine may add to the cancer risk by stimulating cellular growth via non-neuronal acetylcholine receptors, by suppressing apoptosis, and by inducing angiogenesis not only in atheromatous plaques but also in tumors. In the present study the possible direct genotoxic effects of nicotine on DNA were investigated in human target cells of carcinogenesis in the upper aerodigestive tract. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Human nasal mucosa, lymphatic tissue of the palatine tonsils, supraglottic epithelium of the larynx, and peripheral lymphocytes were exposed to rising concentrations of nicotine. DNA damage was investigated by alkaline single-cell microgel electrophoresis (Comet) assay. Cytotoxicity was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. RESULTS: Nicotine induced dose-dependent DNA damage in all cell types at low cytotoxic concentrations that allowed viabilities well above 80%. The lowest nicotine concentrations eliciting a significant increase in DNA migration were 1 mM for tonsillar cells and 0.25 mM for all other cell types.",

Different inherited models were utilized to perform the pooled analysis. Subgroup analyses and sensitive analyses based on Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) test results were also carried out. RESULTS: Our study did not found a significant overall effect of BDNF Val66Met on the susceptibility to PTSD under various genetic models. In contrast, subgroup analyses suggested that the stress status of the control group, but not ethnicity, may influence the relationship of BDNF Val66Met with PTSD risk. After the exclusion of a study that was not in HWE, our conclusions remained unchanged during the influence analyses.",

Non-contrast renal MR angiographic (MRA) techniques are potentially well suited to the screening of donors; however, their restricted imaging field of view (FOV) has previously been an important limitation. We sought to assess whether the addition of a large FOV balanced fast field echo (BFFE) steady-state free precession (SSFP) sequence to non-contrast SSFP MRA could overcome this problem. Comparison with contrast-enhanced MRA (CE MRA) and findings at surgery were performed. METHODS: 22 potential renal donors each underwent SSFP and CE MRA. 11 out of 22 potential donors subsequently underwent a donor nephrectomy. RESULTS: All images were diagnostic. Both SSFP MRA and CE MRA identified an equal number of arteries. Surgery confirmed two accessory renal arteries, both demonstrated with both imaging techniques. A third accessory vessel was identified with both techniques on a kidney contralateral to the donated organ. 6 out of 11 procured kidneys demonstrated early branch arteries at surgery, 5 out of 6 of which had been depicted on both SSFP and CE MRA. The median grading of image quality for main renal arteries was slightly better for CE MRA (p=0.048), but for accessory vessels it was better for SSFP MRA.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Mushroom is widely consumed in Turkey because it is inexpensive and widely available. Intoxication with mushroom is a common health problem in Turkey with a high mortality rate.AIM: To identify the outcome of patients with wild mushroom intoxication who were diagnosed based on systematic criteria and had received a comprehensive treatment. METHODS: Seventy-seven patients admitted to the Emergency Department of our hospital with mushroom intoxication were retrospectively evaluated. The patients were administered a combined treatment of gastric lavage, activated charcoal, penicillin G, N-acetyl cysteine, silybin and hemofiltration. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data of patients and the outcomes of the treatment modality were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 77 patients, 46 (59.7%) females and 31 (40.3%) males were evaluated in the study. The mean age of the patients was 41.94 \u00b1 15.40 years. They presented with nausea and vomiting within 4 to 48 hours. Sixteen patients (20.7%) had abdominal pain, six patients had (7.7%) diarrhea and five patients (6.5%) had jaundice. Seven patients (9%) developed acute liver failure and were referred to intensive care units. Five of these patients recovered without any liver transplantation; one patient had cadaveric liver transplantation but died in the early period after the transplantation and one patient died while waiting for transplantation. The rest of the patients were followed by us and they all have recovered.",
        "output": "The results of the study showed that the mortality rate of mushroom intoxication can be decreased with an early diagnosis and comprehensive treatment. The most common presenting symptoms of mushroom intoxication were nausea and vomiting. Abdominal pain, diarrhea and jaundice were also observed in some patients. Sixteen patients developed acute liver failure and seven of them died. However, five of these patients recovered without any liver transplantation and one patient died while waiting for transplantation. The rest of the patients were followed up and all of them recovered. These results suggest that an early diagnosis and comprehensive treatment can decrease mortality in mushroom intoxication."

Who wouldn't argue for a standardized set of performance-based assessments to assure competency in graduating students and residents? Even so, conceptual concerns have already been raised about this new system and there is yet no evidence to refute their veracity. AIMS: We argue that practical concerns deserve equal consideration, and present evidence strongly suggesting these concerns should be taken seriously. METHOD: Specifically, we share two historical examples that illustrate what happened in two disparate contexts (K-12 education and the Department of Defense [DOD]) when competency (or outcomes-based) assessment frameworks were implemented. We then examine how observation and assessment of clinical performance stands currently in medical schools and residencies, since these methodologies will be challenged to a greater degree by expansive lists of competencies and milestones.RESULTS/",
        "output": "In K-12 education, the implementation of competency-based education resulted in a shift away from traditional curricula and a focus on mastery of basic skills, leading to a decrease in student performance on standardized tests. In the DOD, the adoption of competency-based assessment frameworks led to a decrease in readiness and an increase in cost. In medical education and residency, current assessment methods rely heavily on observation and feedback from faculty and peers, which will be challenged by expansive lists of competencies and milestones.\n\nWe argue that competency-based education should not be implemented without considering the potential pitfalls of the past. Adoption of competency-based frameworks should be done with caution, and with a clear understanding of the potential consequences."

It is unclear whether the association is credible, in the sense that mortality and young fatherhood appear to be associated because both are determined by family-related environmental, socioeconomic and genetic characteristics. METHODS: We used a household-based 10% sample drawn from the 1950 Finnish census to estimate all-cause mortality of fathers born during 1940-1950. The fathers were followed from age 45 until death, or the end of age 54. We used a standard Cox model and a sibling fixed-effects Cox model to examine whether the effect of young fatherhood was independent of observed adulthood characteristics and unobserved early-life characteristics shared by brothers. RESULTS: Men who had their first child before the age of 22 or at ages 22-24 had higher mortality as compared with their brothers who had their first child at the median or mean age of 25-26. Men who had their first child later at ages 30-44 had lower mortality than their brothers who had a first child before the age of 25. The pattern of results from a standard model was similar to that obtained from a fixed-effects sibling model.",

        "input": "INTRODUCTION: The use of human umbilical cord Wharton Jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hWJ-MSCs) has been considered a new potential source for future safe applications in regenerative medicine. Indeed, the application of hWJ-MSCs into different animal models of disease, including those from the central nervous system, has shown remarkable therapeutic benefits mostly associated with their secretome. Conventionally, hWJ-MSCs are cultured and characterized under normoxic conditions (21 % oxygen tension), although the oxygen levels within tissues are typically much lower (hypoxic) than these standard culture conditions. Therefore, oxygen tension represents an important environmental factor that may affect the performance of mesenchymal stem cells in vivo. However, the impact of hypoxic conditions on distinct mesenchymal stem cell characteristics, such as the secretome, still remains unclear. METHODS: In the present study, we have examined the effects of normoxic (21 % O2) and hypoxic (5 % O2) conditions on the hWJ-MSC secretome. Subsequently, we address the impact of the distinct secretome in the neuronal cell survival and differentiation of human neural progenitor cells. RESULTS: The present data indicate that the hWJ-MSC secretome collected from normoxic and hypoxic conditions displayed similar effects in supporting neuronal differentiation of human neural progenitor cells in vitro. However, proteomic analysis revealed that the use of hypoxic preconditioning led to the upregulation of several proteins within the hWJ-MSC secretome.",

METHODS: Clinical and paraclinical data from 32 patients with TIA were compared with 32 patients with MAWH and 32 with MA. Participants underwent a thorough evaluation including standardized clinical examination, laboratory testing, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, cardiovascular work-up, and electroencephalogram. RESULTS: Patient with TIA were significantly older (65.41 \u00b1 16.93 years) than patients with MAWH (50.41 \u00b1 19.69, P = .002) or MA (40.56 \u00b1 11.72, P = .00001), and were mostly male (male:female = .82) compared with the 2 other groups.

In this study, we tried to evaluate the relation between NE of childhood and nocturia of young adulthood. METHODS: A total of 577 female university students aged 17-24 years were included in the survey. A face-to-face questionnaire was administered concerning present nocturia and past NE history. A non-validated questionnaire, created by the authors, was used to evaluate the presence and the frequency of childhood NE and present nocturia. All participant data were checked by telephone contact with their parents. RESULTS: The overall prevalence rates of nocturia and history of nocturnal enuresis in the study population were 8.6 % and 15 % respectively. Sixteen per cent of nocturics and 15 % of non-nocturics had a history of childhood NE (p\u2009=\u20090.837). The childhood NE was graded as severe or infrequent.

A trained psychiatrist blind to the status of index probands obtained the information. Morbid risk in relatives was calculated using abridged Weinberg's method of age correction. RESULTS: Rates of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder were elevated in the relatives of schizophrenia and bipolar probands, but there was no evidence of coaggregation. The risk for major depression was significantly elevated in the relatives of schizophrenia probands and was comparable to the risk in the relatives of bipolar probands. LIMITATIONS: Family history method was used to obtain information about relatives. Schizoaffective disorder patients were not included in the study and this may have amplified the distinction between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.",

METHODS: Thirty-four morbidly obese patients with body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2))>/=40 were compared with 36 patients with BMI<30. Right IJV puncture was simulated using an ultrasound probe directed towards the sternal notch at the midpoint between the sternal notch and the mastoid process. The investigator placing the probe was blinded as to the image being created on the ultrasound machine. Success rate was assessed at three different head rotation angles from midline; 0 degrees , 30 degrees , and 60 degrees . RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in successful simulated IJV puncture between two groups for any of the head positions. However, there was a higher incidence of the carotid artery (CA) puncture in the morbidly obese patient group when the head rotation was advanced from neutral position to 60 degrees (p<0.05). In addition, the ultrasound showed significantly more overlapping of the IJV over the CA in morbidly obese patients at 0 degrees (p<0.05) and 30 degrees (p<0.05). Our results show no statistically significant difference in success rate of IJV puncture between morbidly obese patients and nonobese patients.

STUDY DESIGN: The study group comprised 100 consecutive patients with sporadic hyperparathyroidism and an unequivocally positive sestamibi scan who were undergoing MIP in our unit from June 2004 until October 2005, from whom blood was collected for parathyroid hormone measurement preoperatively, preexcision, and at 10 and 30 minutes postremoval. No action was taken on the results of the test. RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients were cured by MIP alone. Two patients had persistent hyperparathyroidism, one of whom was cured with subsequent open reexploration and removal of a second adenoma, and the other remains hypercalcemic despite additional open neck exploration. IOPTH in both patients failed to fall in retrospect, only the first would have been cured by conversion at the time of operation. The value-added accuracy of IOPTH was really only 1%.

METHODS: The initial item pool for the index test consisted of 15 items. In a 4-year period, a total of 12,957 persons filled out the test on a specifically designed web-site. Six thousand one hundred ninety-four complete data sets could be used for statistical analysis. The validated German version of the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI-d) served as reference standard to estimate the accuracy of the screening test. In order to test several possible ways of combining items a multi-step procedure employing univariate analyses, multiple logistic regression, and classification and regression tree analysis was applied to a learning sample and cross-validated in a test sample. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, accuracy, diagnostic odds ratio as well as adjusted odds ratio) of the items and resulting models to discriminate women with sexual dysfunction from those without were calculated. RESULTS: One dichotomous question for overall satisfaction proved to show high accuracy as a stand-alone instrument and played also a central role in multivariate models. It may be recommended as a one-question screening test (76.4% sensitivity and 76.5% specificity in the test sample). A hierarchical two-question test yielded higher sensitivity (93.5%) and lower specificity (60.1%).

One important but under-studied design aspect is the extent to which pay-for-performance schemes reflect local priorities. The English Department of Health White Paper High Quality Care for All introduced a Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) Framework from April 2009, under which local commissioners and providers were required to negotiate and implement an annual pay-for-performance scheme. In 2010/2011, these schemes covered 1.5% (\u00a3 1.0 bn) of NHS expenditure. Local design was intended to offer flexibility to local priorities and generate local enthusiasm, while retaining good design properties of focusing on outcomes and processes with a clear link to quality, using established indicators where possible, and covering three key domains of quality (safety; effectiveness; patient experience) and innovation. We assess the extent to which local design achieved these objectives. METHODS: Quantitative analysis of 337 locally negotiated CQUIN schemes in 2010/2011, along with qualitative analysis of 373 meetings (comprising 800 hours of observation) and 230 formal interviews (audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim) with NHS staff in 12 case study sites. RESULTS: The local development process was successful in identifying variation in local needs and priorities for quality improvement but the involvement of frontline clinical staff was insufficient to generate local enthusiasm around the schemes.

Investigations aim to distinguish between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (e.g. Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). As an acute phase protein, faecal calprotectin measurement may be useful in this context. METHODS: A new ELISA-based assay for calprotectin was evaluated. The ability of calprotectin to distinguish between patients with IBS and Crohn's disease was studied. RESULTS: The assay showed adequate inter- and intra-batch imprecision and was suitable for routine use in the laboratory. Calprotectin concentration was significantly greater in patients with Crohn's disease compared with controls (n = 25, P<0.001) and patients with IBS (n = 25, P<0.001).",
        "output": "The results of this study suggest that faecal calprotectin may be a useful marker for Crohn's disease. Calprotectin concentration was significantly higher in patients with Crohn's disease compared to both controls and patients with IBS, suggesting that it may be useful in distinguishing between these two conditions.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: The ideal approach to the treatment of soft cervical disc herniation remains controversial. Recent reports emphasize several variations of anterior cervical approaches, including the introduction of instrumentation techniques. New issues have been raised and modern neurosurgeons seem to be less familiar with the posterior approach. The objective of this study was to analyze the results obtained by surgical treatment via a posterior approach of soft cervical disc herniation. METHOD: Fifty-one patients who underwent laminectomy/flavectomy and disc removal for the treatment of soft cervical disc herniation in the period of 1990 to 1999 were analyzed retrospectively. Relief of pain and motor and sensory improvement were the criteria used to measure the success of the procedure. RESULTS: Most of the patients presented with acute radiculopathy. Radicular involvement was as follows: 25 cases-C7 root, 19 cases-C6 root, 4 cases-C5 root, and 3 cases-C8 root. Total relief of pain was obtained in 49 of 51 patients (96%). Motor improvement was obtained in 35 of 46 patients (76%) and sensory improvement in 22 of 35 patients (62.8%) in the short term. The mean time of hospitalization was 3 days. There was no mortality and no morbidity.",

This study was designed to compare CSM and recurrence rates after either unilateral lobectomy (UL) or bilateral lobar resection (BLR) in patients with PTC considered low risk by AMES criteria. METHODS: Outcome was studied in 1685 patients initially treated during 1940 through 1991 and followed for up to 54 postoperative years (mean, 18 years). One thousand six hundred fifty-six patients (98%) had complete primary tumor resection; 634 (38%) had involvement of regional nodes. One hundred ninety-five patients (12%) had UL; BLR accounted for 1468 (near-total 60%; total thyroidectomy 18%). RESULTS: Thirty-year rates for CSM and distant metastasis were 2% and 3%, respectively. Twenty-year rates for local recurrence and nodal metastasis were 4% and 8%, respectively. There were no significant differences in CSM or distant metastasis rates between UL and BLR (P>.2).

        "instruction": "Should a doctor stop rendering medical services?",
        "input": "INTRODUCTION: According to the general idea a doctor can start the medical management process in an adult and not legally incapacitated patient after the patient has given consent to initiate such a process. The patient's refusal makes rendering medical services impossible, irrespective of their scope and kind. It should be emphasized that such a refusal is respected if it is expressed fully, clearly and consciously. Cases in which such a refusal is expressed by an intoxicated suicidal patient, remaining under the influence of narcotics, drugs or medicaments which characterize with a similar activity should be particularly analysed. Although such a person is able to verbally declare his objection, his ability to process the information given by the doctor before initiating medical procedures is limited, or even non-existant. The refusal therefore cannot be regarded as reliable, which results in rendering medical services to the patient. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An analysis was made of Acts of Law and the opinions of the judiciar by comparing and excluding contradictory and incoherent elements. RESULTS: Despite the lack of clear regulations of a patient rejecting procedures aimed at saving the patient's life, or the prevention of serious health impairment or sustaining injury, it should be assumed that the objection expressed by the patient who does not demonstrate the ability to process the information provided by the doctor is not reliable, and the doctor is therefore still obliged to render medical services. External factors, such as consumption of alcohol, narcotics and drugs, which characterize with a similar activity impair perception and make the taking of a conscious decision impossible. Not providing medical help and introducing direct compulsion would mean neglecting provision of due diligence in the process of treatment and, as a consequence, placing the patient's health at risk, and suffering from negative implications for the patient's life and/or health in the future.",
        "output": "No, a doctor should not stop rendering medical services if the patient has not given consent. The patient's refusal of medical services should be respected if it is expressed fully, clearly and consciously. However, if the patient is intoxicated, narcotized, or under the influence of drugs or medicaments which characterize with a similar activity, their refusal cannot be regarded as reliable, and the doctor is still obliged to render medical services."

Laparoscopy is today considered the first-choice treatment of many adrenal diseases, although its use is still controversial for large adrenal masses and incidentally found adrenal cortical carcinoma. METHODS: A total of 125 patients underwent lateral transperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy. The indications were either functioning or nonfunctioning adrenal masses, without any radiologic evidence of involvement of the surrounding structures. The correlation between the size and the operative times, estimated blood loss, incidence of intraoperative and postoperative complications, and length of hospital stay were studied with Pearson's correlation coefficient, Fisher's exact test, and the chi-square test. The analysis of variance test was used to evaluate any possible correlation between the size and clinicopathologic features and the results. RESULTS: A slight correlation was observed between the size and operative time (P = 0.004), but no correlation was observed between the size and the other parameters. Statistical analysis showed a significant correlation between the clinicopathologic patterns (nonfunctioning benign adrenal masses, Conn's adenoma, Cushing's adenoma, pheochromocytoma, adrenal cortical cancer, and other tumor metastasis) and the operative time (P = 0.011), but not with the other parameters.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared the outcome of 3 different but widely accepted treatment protocols for bladder cancer in order to find which, if any, was superior, with particular emphasis upon the performance of the newest treatment, neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Data on 224 bladder patients treated at our institution (1975 to 1991) with 1 of the 3 protocols was analyzed. Those protocols were: 1. radiotherapy>60 Gy (143 patients); 2. low dose radiotherapy followed by cystectomy (25 patients); 3. chemotherapy followed by either definitive radiotherapy or surgery (56 patients). Because the latter group was also a chronologically newer group with a shorter possible follow-up, we compared all treatments on the basis of 2-year survival, using Kaplan-Meier life tables. We briefly reviewed those modalities which are bladder-sparing because of the significance to quality of life of this factor. RESULTS: Two-year survival figures for the patients were: 63% for those who received only radiotherapy; 72% for those undergoing cystectomy: 68% for the group to whom neoadjuvant chemotherapy was administered. The differences were not statistically significant. However, 23% of those patients treated neoadjuvantly were alive with intact bladders at 2 years.",

Several studies in the past have attempted to demonstrate that prophylactic antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in patients with brain tumors can decrease the incidence of seizures. However, it is currently unclear whether AEDs should be routinely administered to patients with brain tumors who have never had a seizure. OBJECTIVE: A meta-analysis of randomized trials was conducted to estimate the effectiveness of seizure prophylaxis in people with brain tumors. METHODS: A range of electronic databases were searched (1966-2014): MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library Database, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science and the Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) without language restrictions. Two independent reviewers assessed trials for eligibility and quality, and meta-analysis was performed using the STATA 12.0 software. Integrated Odd Ratio (OR) with its corresponding 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was calculated. RESULTS: Six RCTs were included with a total of 547 patients with brain tumors. The meta-analysis results revealed that patients with brain tumors who received prophylactic antiepileptic interventions did not have significantly lower epilepsy incidence than those in controlled groups (OR=0.939, 95%CI=0.609-1.448, z=0.29, P=0.775).

Expansion to 38-62 CAG repeats leads to the neurodegenerative disorder with male infertility called Kennedy's disease. Recently it was suggested that slight expansion is related to male subfertility. In this study we investigated the association of male subfertility with the length of CAG repeats in the androgen receptor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CAG repeat length in the androgen receptor gene was investigated in 75 subfertile men, who were mainly candidates for intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Sperm parameters varied from azoospermia to severe oligoasthenoteratozoospermia. The control group consisted of 70 men who predominantly had bladder cancer. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood and genotyping was performed with polymerase chain reaction based methods. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference in the mean length of the CAG repeat plus or minus standard deviation was noted in subfertile men and controls (22.2 +/- 3.1 and 21.7 +/- 3.4, respectively).

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Semirigid cervical collars (SRCCs) are routinely applied to victims of explosions as part of the prehospital trauma protocols. Previous studies have shown that the use of SRCC in penetrating injuries is not justified because of the scarcity of unstable cervical spine injuries and the risk of obscuring other neck injuries. Explosion can inflict injuries by fragments penetration, blast injury, blunt force, and burns. The purpose of the study was to determine the occurrence of cervical spine instability without irreversible neurologic deficit and other potentially life-threatening nonskeletal neck injuries among victims of explosions. The potential benefits and risks of SRCC application in explosion-related injuries were evaluated. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of all explosion civilian victims admitted to Israeli hospitals during the years 1998 to 2010. Data collection was based on the Israeli national trauma registry and the hospital records and included demographic, clinical, and radiologic details of all patients with documented cervical spine injuries. RESULTS: The cohort included 2,267 patients. All of them were secondary to terrorist attacks. SRCC was applied to all the patients at the scene. Nineteen patients (0.83%) had cervical spine fractures. Nine patients (0.088%) had unstable cervical spine injury. All but one had irreversible neurologic deficit on admission. A total of 151 patients (6.6%) had potentially life-threatening penetrating nonskeletal neck injuries.",

OBJECTIVE: The authors investigated the performance of a decision-support classifier for the diagnosis of traumatic injury with blood loss, implemented with three different data-processing methods. For each method, they computed standard diagnostic test characteristics and novel metrics related to decision consistency and latency. SETTING: Prehospital air ambulance transport. PATIENTS: A total of 557 trauma patients. DESIGN: Continually monitored vital-sign data from 279 patients (50%) were randomly selected for classifier development, and the remaining were used for testing. Three data-processing methods were evaluated over 16 min of patient monitoring: a 2-min moving window, time averaging, and postprocessing with the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT). MEASUREMENTS: Sensitivity and specificity were computed. Consistency was quantified through cumulative counts of decision changes over time and the fraction of patients affected by false alarms. Latency was evaluated by the fraction of patients without a decision. RESULTS: All 3 methods showed very similar final sensitivities and specificities. Yet, there were significant differences in terms of the fraction of patients affected by false alarms, decision changes through time, and latency. For instance, use of the SPRT led to a 75% reduction in the number of decision changes and a 36% reduction in the number of patients affected by false alarms, at the expense of 3% unresolved final decisions.",

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of data from a previous randomized clinical trial. METHODS: A total of 208 patients who were mechanically ventilated on controlled modes and met criteria for assisted breathing were randomized to receive either PS (n = 100) or PAV+ (n = 108). Changes in ventilator settings and in the dose of sedatives, analgesics, and vasoactive medications were identified during the period in which the patients were ventilated either with PS (30.4 +/- 17.4 h) or PAV+ (30.0 +/- 18.1 h) and classified as changes to facilitate weaning (CFW) or changes to respond to deterioration (CD). RESULTS: The mean number of changes in ventilator settings was significantly higher with PS than that with PAV+ (10.7 +/- 5.7 vs. 8.9 +/- 4.6). With PS the proportion of these changes classified as CFW was significantly lower than that with PAV+ (59.8% vs. 69.2%).

Successful management of vasospasm will ultimately depend on a clear understanding of the scope of this phenomenon, including whether arterial elements of different calibers are equally affected. We therefore examined the responses to subarachnoid hemorrhage in rabbit basilar arteries, small pial arteries, and arterioles. SUMMARY OF REPORT: We compared the brain stem pial arteries of 10 perfusion-fixed male New Zealand White rabbits after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage to those of five control rabbits using morphological analysis of cross-sections of plastic-embedded vessels. After subarachnoid hemorrhage, the internal elastic lamina was highly corrugated in all basilar arteries (mean diameter 319 +/- 51 microns). These arteries were severely constricted in comparison with the control group, in which the mean diameter was 691 +/- 17 microns, and corrugation of the internal elastic lamina was not present. In contrast, small pial arteries and arterioles very rarely demonstrated a vasoconstrictive configuration after subarachnoid hemorrhage. The contractility of the smaller vessels was confirmed by injecting 2 mg/kg BaCl2 intracisternally. Following BaCl2 injection, corrugation of the internal elastic lamina was detected in the small arteries and arterioles as well as the basilar arteries.",

However, the data are conflicting and it is not clear whether gender is a true independent risk factor for death in this setting. We analyzed our database to determine whether gender is an independent risk factor for death after CABG. PATIENTS AND DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of 1 758 isolated first-time coronary artery bypass graft patients treated between 2003 and 2005 was conducted in the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery of Rabin Medical Center, a major tertiary facility in Israel. RESULTS: The female patients had a distinctly different pre- and intraoperative profile compared with the male patients, and significantly higher postoperative mortality (p<0.05). On a propensity scoring of 359 matched pairs, the risk factors for death were found to be severe left ventricular dysfunction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and use of an intra-aortic balloon pump (p<0.05). The addition of intraoperative data to the model yielded only cardiopulmonary bypass time and use of an intra-aortic balloon pump as risk factors for death (p<0.05). Validation with the bootstrap technique revealed that strong predictors of death (>50 % of the sample) were cardiopulmonary bypass time, use of an intra-aortic balloon pump, and, to a lesser extent, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

After a positive SN, additional metastases are present in an unpredictable percentage, as variable as 13-66%, of axillary clearances. Our aim is to define variables associated with non-sentinel node (NSN) metastases and to determine the predictive value of a derived clinical decision rule. METHODS: A consecutive series of patients with a positive SN submitted to SN biopsy plus axillary dissection was evaluated from June 1999 to December 2004 (n=143). Patient-, tumour- and SN-related variables were analysed in relation to the presence of additional metastasis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were done and predictive values of a clinical decision rule based on significant variables were estimated. RESULTS: A total of 66 patients had metastasis in non-sentinel axillary nodes. No significant differences were present between this group and those with only the SN metastasised. Significant and independent association was found between NSN positivity and increasing tumour size, the presence of multifocality and the presence of peritumoral lymph channel invasion.",

        "input": "STUDY DESIGN: The three-dimensional flexibility of six human lumbar functional spinal units was measured after the anterolateral insertion of an interbody cage. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether an interbody cage inserted from an anterolateral direction stabilizes the spine with respect to the intact state and to compare the finding with that from the same cage inserted from an anterior direction. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Several biomechanical studies have shown that interbody cages do not stabilize the spine in extension. It is suspected that this may be caused by the destruction of the anterior longitudinal ligament and anterior anulus fibrosus. METHODS: Six human cadaveric lumbar functional spinal units were tested under pure moments of flexion, extension, bilateral axial rotation, and bilateral lateral bending to a maximum of 10 Nm. The relative intervertebral motions were measured by an optoelectronic camera system with the spinal units in the intact condition, after discectomy, after anterolateral interbody cage stabilization, and with additional translaminar screw fixation. The implant used was a central, porous, contoured implant with endplate fit. The results were compared with those of a previous study, which used the same implant inserted from an anterior direction. RESULTS: The anterolateral cage insertion significantly decreased the motion in comparison with the intact situation in flexion and lateral bending, but not in extension or axial rotation. No differences were found between the anterior and anterolateral insertion approaches in flexion or extension, but differences were observed in axial rotation and lateral bending, in which the anterolateral approach resulted in more motion. Additional translaminar screw fixation reduced motion to below intact levels in all loading directions. None of the surgical procedures introduced asymmetrical behavior.",
        "output": "Yes, anterolateral cage insertion enhances immediate stabilization of the functional spinal unit in comparison to the intact state. This is due to the destruction of the anterior longitudinal ligament and anterior anulus fibrosus that occurs with discectomy, which is addressed by the anterolateral cage insertion. The anterolateral approach also provides more stabilization than the anterior approach in axial rotation and lateral bending, but not in flexion or extension. Additionally, translaminar screw fixation further reduces motion to below intact levels in all loading directions."

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Allergy to grass pollen is a highly prevalent allergic disease. Hay fever is more predominant in urban than in rural areas, despite the increasingly smaller areas of surrounding grassland. The effect of vehicle exhaust pollutants, mainly diesel particles, and other industrial sources of atmospheric pollution leading to plant damage has been implicated in this phenomenon. OBJECTIVE: This study compared the in vivo and in vitro allergenicity of pooled samples of Lolium perenne grass pollen harvested from 10 different urban areas with that of samples of the same pollen from 10 neighboring rural areas. METHODS: Lolium perenne pollen from different parts of a city and from a nearby rural area was harvested in 1999 and 2000 during the peak pollination period. Protein composition was compared by SDS-PAGE and in vivo and in vitro IgE-binding capacity was compared by skin-prick tests, RAST-inhibition and measurement of the major allergen, Lol p 5. RESULTS: In the two years under study, urban samples contained approximately twice the protein content of the rural samples. Biological activity and Lol p 5 content was higher in urban pollen than in rural pollen and showed differences in the two years under study.",

We describe a patient with focal pathology in the left STG, giving rise acutely to a fluent dysphasia, which gradually evolved into formal thought disorder. METHOD: Clinical, neuropsychological, neuropsychiatric, and neuroradiological assessment. RESULTS: A right-handed patient, AJ, presented acutely with a fluent dysphasia. His speech output gradually evolved from undifferentiated jargon, through neologistic jargon, to an intelligible but bizarre form of discourse. Comprehension was relatively well preserved. Radiology revealed an arteriovenous malformation in the left middle, and inferior temporal gyri, with reduced perfusion of the left STG. Six months later his overt dysphasia had recovered, but his speech retained some of its previous characteristics, in particular a tendency to a loose association of ideas which now suggested a disorder of thought.",
        "output": "AJ presented with a fluent dysphasia, which gradually evolved into a formal thought disorder. This disorder was likely caused by a left temporal arteriovenous malformation, which was later found on radiological assessment. The disorder is likely a combination of Wernicke's dysphasia and formal thought disorder, as it showed characteristics of both."

We explored whether outcomes differed in patient with delirium with different consultation requests. METHODS: Patients with delirium (n=114) were divided into subtypes based on consultation requests for the management for cognitive dysfunction [altered mental status (AMS), n=46], for agitation or behavior disturbance (BEH, n=26), for depression (DEP, n=18), and for all other reasons (MISC, n=33). Adjusted multivariate regression models were used to examine group differences. RESULTS: Consult requests for AMS had a high likelihood ratio (LR+=14.22) and requests for BEH had moderately high likelihood ratio (LR+=4.79) of receiving a diagnosis of delirium. The DEP group (n=18) tended to be younger and had higher 30-day readmission rates.

It aids accurate delineation of perforator anatomy, assists pre-operative decision making and reduces operative time. However, such detailed imaging invariably yields a variety of incidental findings, with quoted figures of 13-36% in this setting. The purpose of this study was to identify the rate of \"incidentalomas\" when using DIEP CT angiography and, review how such findings influence our management. METHOD: A retrospective review was performed, looking at pre-operative scan reports of 154 consecutive patients undergoing free DIEP flap breast reconstructions between July 2008 and June 2012. RESULTS: Of 154 CTA's reviewed, 116 (75.3%) demonstrated incidental findings. In 71 patients (46.1%), these \"incidentalomas\" were inconsequential. However, in 37 patients (24.0%) the CTA prompted further investigations, and notably in a further 8 patients (5.2%) metastatic disease or other significant pathology was discovered which changed the operative plan.",

This finding suggests that the multidiscipline training undertaken by triathletes interferes with adaptation of the neuromuscular system to cycling training in triathletes. The purpose of this study was to determine if similar interference with adaptation of the neuromuscular system would be evident during running in elite triathletes. METHODS: We compared intramuscular electromyographic (EMG) recordings from five muscles of the leg (tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior, peroneus longus, gastrocnemius lateralis, and soleus) during running at a controlled running speed between elite triathletes, runners matched to the triathletes for running training history (i.e., equally trained runners), and less-trained runners. RESULTS: Normalized EMG waveforms (i.e., time-series EMG data) were not different between groups, nor was EMG modulation (i.e., variations in EMG amplitude within strides). Individual variance (i.e., variability in muscle recruitment between strides for individual athletes) was greater for less-trained runners but was not different between elite triathletes and equally trained runners. Population variance (i.e., variability in muscle recruitment between athletes) was greater between less-trained runners for four of five muscles, but it was greater between elite triathletes than between equally trained runners for only two muscles.",

The aim of this study was to explore how the use of individual accelerometer cut points (ICPs) affected the analysis of PA field data. METHODS: We performed a treadmill calibration protocol to determine cut points for moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) (\u22653 metabolic equivalents) and assessed free-living PA in 44 severely obese subjects using the Actigraph GT1M accelerometer. We obtained cut points in 42 subjects (11 men, mean (standard deviation) of body mass index (BMI) 39.8 (5.7), age 43.2 (9.2) years), of whom 35 had valid measurement of free-living PA (minutes of MVPA/day). Linear regression was used to analyze associations with the ICPs and time in MVPA/day. MVPA/day was also compared with values derived using a group cut point (GCP). RESULTS: Resting oxygen consumption (partial r = 0.74, p<.001), work economy (partial r = -0.76, p<.001) and BMI (partial r = 0.52, p = .001) explained 68.4% of the variation in the ICPs (F = 26.7, p<.001). The ICPs explained 79.1% of the variation in the minutes spent in MVPA/day. Moderate to vigorous PA/day derived from the ICPs vs. the GCP varied substantially (R2 = 14%, p = .023, coefficient of variation = 45.1%).",

We evaluated housestaff experience with a pilot intervention that replaced postcall continuity clinics with evening continuity clinics. METHODS: We began this pilot program at one continuity clinic site for pediatric residents. Instead of postcall clinics, residents had evening continuity clinic added to a regular clinic day when they were neither postcall nor on call. At 5 and 11 months, we surveyed housestaff satisfaction and experience with the evening clinics, particularly in comparison to postcall clinics. RESULTS: Nineteen of 23 pediatric residents participated in the pilot program. Twenty-two and 17 residents completed the 5- and 11-month follow-up surveys, respectively. A significantly greater proportion of residents rated their overall satisfaction with evening clinic as good/outstanding (16/18, 89%) compared with postcall clinic (2/19, 11%) at the 5-month survey (P<.01). Resident preference for evening clinic over postcall clinic persisted but was not statistically significant at 11 months (P =.05), and overall satisfaction with evening clinic was unchanged from the 5- and 11-month surveys (P =.64).

This study aimed to clarify this issue. METHODS: The subjects consisted of 30 DPN patients without clinical CTS and 50 CTS patients without diabetes mellitus. An antidromic sensory conduction study stimulating the median nerve at the wrist and palm was performed. The SCV distal to the palm (SCVpf) and across the carpal tunnel (SCVwp) and the sensory nerve action potential amplitude following palmar stimulation (AMP-p) were evaluated. RESULTS: The SCVwp was significantly lower than the SCVpf in DPN patients, implying the frequent presence of subclinical lesion at the carpal tunnel. The SCVpf was similar for both groups. The AMP-p was disproportionately low in relation to SCVwp in DPN patients, as compared with CTS patients.",

METHODS: Distances from the coronary ostia to the calcified aortic valve were measured during open heart aortic valve replacement in 60 consecutive patients. Distances were compared to preoperative CT-scan measurements evaluating distance of the coronary ostia as well (n = 15). RESULTS: The distances of the lower lip of the left and the right coronary artery ostia measured from the aortic annulus were 14.7 \u00b1 3.9 mm and 13.4 \u00b1 4.0 mm, respectively. The left, right and noncoronary cusp heights were 13.9 \u00b1 2.5 mm, 12.8 \u00b1 3.0 mm and 13.3 \u00b1 3.1 mm, respectively.

Improvements in symptoms (change in IPSS) and quality of life [measured by BPH Impact Index (BII) and question 8 of the IPSS (IPSS-Q8)] were analysed in the FDC group, men who initiated tamsulosin (WW-TAM) and men who received no medical intervention (WW-no treatment) and the impact of baseline variables on IPSS determined. RESULTS: The adjusted mean decrease in IPSS, BII and IPSS-Q8 at each post-baseline visit over 24\u00a0months appeared greater in the FDC (n\u00a0=\u00a0369) and WW-no treatment groups (n\u00a0=\u00a0144) than in the WW-TAM group (n\u00a0=\u00a0229). IPSS improvements appeared similar in the FDC group and WW-no treatment subgroup, except in patients with the greatest degree of bother at baseline (BII 7-13).",
        "output": "Yes, baseline characteristics can be used to assess which men with moderately symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) at risk of progression will benefit from treatment. In the post hoc analysis of the 2-year CONDUCT study, men with the greatest degree of bother at baseline (BII 7-13) appeared to benefit more from lifestyle changes and fixed-dose combination (FDC) of dutasteride and tamsulosin than men with less bothersome symptoms."

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyse the use of lights and siren (L&S) during transport to the hospital by the prehospital severity status of the patient and the time saved by the time of day of the mission. METHODS: We searched the Public Health Services data of a Swiss state from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2010. All primary patient transports within the state were included (24 718). The data collected were on the use of L&S, patient demographics, the time and duration of transport, the type of mission (trauma vs. nontrauma) and the severity of the condition according to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) score assigned by the paramedics and/or emergency physician. We excluded 212 transports because of missing data. RESULTS: A total of 24 506 ambulance transports met the inclusion criteria. L&S were used 4066 times, or in 16.6% of all missions. Of these, 40% were graded NACA less than 4. Overall, the mean total transport time to return to the hospital was 11.09 min (confidence interval 10.84-11.34) with L&S and 12.84 min (confidence interval 12.72-12.96) without. The difference was 1.75 min (105 s; P<0.001). For night-time runs alone, the mean time saved using L&S was 0.17 min (10.2 s; P=0.27).",
        "output": "The use of lights and siren (L&S) during transport to the hospital appears to be associated with a decrease in total transport time, with the greatest benefit seen during night-time runs. The use of L&S appears to be most beneficial for patients with a NACA score of less than 4, as this group had a mean total transport time of 10.84 minutes with L&S compared to 12.72 minutes without."

Examining data quality, in terms of item non-response, informs choices about which indicators of early-life SEP to include in surveillance questionnaires. This study examined differences in recall of indicators of early-life SEP between different socio-economic groups. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional population survey. METHODS: A representative population of people aged 18 years and over living in South Australia (n=2999) was selected at random from the electronic white pages, and a computer-assisted telephone interview was administered. RESULTS: Respondents with missing data on early-life SEP indicators were disadvantaged in terms of current SEP compared with those who provided this information. Among all respondents, the highest proportions of missing data were observed for maternal grandfather's main occupation (27.2%), and mother's (20.1%) and father's (19.6%) highest level of education. Family structure, housing tenure and family financial situation when the respondent was 10 years old, and mother's and father's main occupation were the indicators of early-life SEP that performed best in terms of recall.",

A similar measurement by 2D imaging (2D-TAPSE) can be obtained. We sought to determine the correlation and strength of agreement between MM-TAPSE and 2D-TAPSE in children. METHODS: Echocardiographic studies performed for clinical indications were reviewed retrospectively. All consecutive subjects \u226418 years of age were included. The cohort was divided into those with normal echocardiographic findings and those with disorders affecting the right ventricle. Digitally recorded images were analyzed for both MM-TAPSE and 2D-TAPSE. Measurements of 2D-TAPSE were made in an apical four-chamber view, from the tricuspid valve annulus to a consistent point at the apex of the imaging sector at end-diastole and end-systole, with the difference representing the 2D-TAPSE value. RESULTS: A total of 329 subjects (mean age 9.0 \u00b1 6.1 years) met entry criteria. Correlation coefficient between MM-TAPSE and 2D-TAPSE was 0.90. Bland-Altman analysis showed agreement between the two methods to be within 1.2 \u00b1 2.6 mm (mean percentage difference of 6.5%). About 1 mm difference between MM-TAPSE and 2D-TAPSE was consistently observed in all diagnostic subgroups, and across all age categories.",

METHODS: Recruitment (N = 360) occurred in a publicly funded STD clinic located in a metropolitan area of the southern United States. Participants were tested for HSV-2 using a rapid test manufactured by Biokit (Lexington, MA) and they completed a self-administered questionnaire before and 3 months after being tested for HSV-2. Follow-up questionnaires were completed by 256 participants (71.1%). RESULTS: Of those completing follow-up, 43.4% (n = 111) tested positive for HSV-2 at enrollment. Significant differences between participants testing positive and those testing negative (at baseline) for HSV-2 over the follow-up period were not observed for frequency of sex, frequency of condom use, avoiding sex, and number of sex partners. Controlling for statistically identified covariates did not alter the null findings for these between group analyses.

One aspect is the orientation of GIB, whereby sectioning perpendicular to the mucosal surface can be performed more readily. With the purpose to achieve correct orientation, GIB is occasionally mounted on millipore filter (MF) in an attempt to place the deep cut side onto the MF. The importance of this technique for section quality is evaluated in this study. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The material comprised three consecutive series of GIB (60 gastric, duodenal, and colorectal GIB, respectively). Sections were grouped in MF-mounted versus non-mounted GIB, the proportion of fully acceptable sections among mounted versus non-mounted GIB was recorded. RESULTS: 77.2% of all GIBs were MF-mounted. 33.1% of mounted GIBs versus 48.8% of non-mounted GIBs were assessed as fully acceptable sections. The differences between these figures are not statistically significant. 41.7% of the mounted GIBs were placed with the mucosal surface facing the MF, which entails a risk of damaging the tissue.",
        "output": "No, mounting gastrointestinal biopsies on a millipore filter does not necessarily improve the quality of the sections. While mounting the biopsies can help with orienting them correctly, it also carries the risk of damaging the tissue. Therefore, it is not recommended to mount gastrointestinal biopsies on a millipore filter."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From a series of men with prostate cancer who had a radical retropubic prostatectomy (RP), we assessed those with cT1c (223) and cT2 (65) adenocarcinoma. All RP specimens were totally embedded and whole-mounted; tumour volume was measured using the grid method. Clinical and pathological characteristics were analysed. RESULTS: Patients with cT2 tumours were more likely to have a higher Gleason score (P = 0.04) and final pathological stage (P = 0.05) than those with cT1c tumours. There was no significant difference in age (P = 0.92), preoperative PSA level (P = 0.17), prostate weight (P = 0.34), tumour volume (P = 0.16), surgical margin status (P = 0.86), multifocality (P = 0.92), the presence of perineural invasion (P = 0.09), or high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (P = 0.99) between patients with clinical stage cT1c and those with cT2 tumours.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: The extra workload induced by patients with mental health problems may sometimes cause GPs to be reluctant to become involved in mental health care. It is known that dealing with patients' mental health problems is more time consuming in specific situations such as in consultations. But it is unclear if GPs who are more often involved in patients' mental health problems, have a higher workload than other GPs. Therefore we investigated the following: Is the attention GPs pay to their patients' mental health problems related to their subjective and objective workload? METHODS: Secondary analyses were made using data from the Second Dutch National Survey of General Practice, a cross sectional study conducted in the Netherlands in 2000-2002. A nationally representative selection of 195 GPs from 104 general practices participated in this National Survey. Data from: 1) a GP questionnaire; 2) a detailed log of the GP's time use during a week and; 3) an electronic medical registration system, including all patients' contacts during a year, were used. Multiple regression analyses were conducted with the GP's workload as an outcome measure, and the GP's attention for mental health problems as a predictor. GP, patient, and practice characteristics were included in analyses as potential confounders. RESULTS: Results show that GPs with a broader perception of their role towards mental health care do not have more working hours or patient contacts than GPs with a more limited perception of their role. Neither are they more exhausted or dissatisfied with the available time. Also the number of patient contacts in which a psychological or social diagnosis is made is not related to the GP's objective or subjective workload.",

Religiosity is a protective factor which has an impact on all of the three dimensions of health status, among others, it goes together with a longer lifetime, better indicators of health status indicators and quality of life, less anxiety, depression and suicide, more effective coping strategies. In relation to adolescent health, less investigation has been available thus far. OBJECTIVE: The main goal of the present study was to investigate the relationship between religiosity and psychological health among adolescents. Regarding religiosity, religious affiliation, religiousness (subjective level of religiosity) and religious participation were assessed. Among health status indicators, occurrence of depressive symptomatology, level of satisfaction with life and self-perceived health were determined. METHODS: Data collection of the questionnaire survey was going on among 881 high school students in Szeged (age range between 14-20 years, mean = 16.6 years, S.D. = 1.3 years of age, 44.6% of the sample was female). Associations between health status indicators (as dependent variables) and religiosity factors (as independent variables) were assessed using Odds Ratios calculated by logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Our findings suggest that youth's religiosity had the least effect on depressive symptomatology, whereas youth defined themselves as religious and those who actually participated at religious events perceived their own health better and they were more satisfied with their life. Girls tended to belong more to a religious community and their religiosity was more associated with life satisfaction and self-perceived health.",

The aims of the present study were to assess the rate of spontaneous recovery from urinary retention in elderly women in rehabilitation centers and to determine whether medical treatment with a adrenergic receptor blockers (a blockers) is effective in resumption of urination in this population. METHODS: We surveyed 84 elderly women with urinary retention, admitted to a geriatric rehabilitation center between September 1998 and March 2000. Most had undergone orthopedic surgeries. Post-voiding urine residual (PVR) was measured 3 days after an acute episode of urinary retention. PVR of 250 mL and below was the desirable outcome. Patients with PVR over 250 mL were randomly assigned to two groups, placebo vs Doxazosin. Medication doses in both groups were increased every 3 days and catheterization was used until a desirable outcome was achieved. RESULTS: Seventy-eight out of the 84 patients entered the study, of whom 48 (62%) recovered spontaneously prior to initiation of medical treatment. Of the remaining 30, 7 patients dropped out and 23 began medical treatment. Twelve women recovered (a similar rate occurred in the placebo and Doxazosin groups), and 11 did not. The study was terminated due to the high rate of spontaneous recovery and because it became clear from the initial results that Doxazosin had no beneficial effect over placebo in the treatment of urinary retention. Diabetes and poor functional status were found to be prognostic factors for recovery failure.",
        "output": "No, medical treatment for urinary retention in rehabilitating elderly women is not necessary in most cases, as the majority of women will recover spontaneously. However, medical treatment may be beneficial in cases where the retention is not spontaneously resolving or in cases where the woman has a poor prognosis due to underlying health conditions."

Retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy might be considered as the cause of the functional and morphological changes at the level of microcirculation. The aim of the study was to assess by means of dynamic capillaroscopy the influence of autonomic diabetic nephropathy (CAN) in adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus on capillary blood flow (CBV) in skin microcirculation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 18 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (mean age 15+/-2 years). In 9 of them the diagnosis of CAN was made on the basis of Ewing tests. The control group consisted of 10 healthy persons aged 15+/-1.5 years. CBV was measured in capillars of the nailfold of the fourth finger during rest and after 2 minutes of arterial occlusion (the occlusion pressure - above 20 mmHg systolic blood pressure - was obtained by the occlusion of brachial artery using sphygnomanometer cuff). RESULTS: The resting CBV did not differ between patients with CAN, without CAN and healthy controls (0.39+/-0.06, 0.41+0.05 i 0.42+/-0.07).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 1681 polyps in 494 patients were categorized as advanced adenomas (villous component or severe dysplasia or early cancer) or insignificant polyps. Chi-squared tests were used to analyze whether polyp histological type could be predicted based on patient age (<60 vs.>or = 60 years), gender, family history of colon polyps or cancer, presence of anemia, polyp size (<or = 5 mm vs.>10 mm), and location (left- vs. right-sided). RESULTS: Insignificant polyp histology (n = 1337) correlated with patient age<60 years (P = 0.0026), lack of anemia (P<0.0001), polyp size<or = 5 mm (P<0.0001), and right-sided location (P= 0.0058). Stepwise inclusion of these parameters demonstrated that the association of a<or = 5 mm right-sided polyp in a patient<60 years yielded the highest combined predictive value (96.2%) for an insignificant polyp. Conversely, age>or = 60 years, presence of anemia, polyp size>10 mm, or left-sided location, as single or combined parameters, demonstrated a maximum predictive value of only 75.4% for an advanced adenoma.",

Most studies have focused on the influence of individual and organizational factors on an employee's intention to quit. Inspired by the observation that providing care is based on the duration of practices, tasks and processes (issues of time) rather than exchange values (wages), this paper focuses on the influence of working-time characteristics and wages on an employee's intention to stay. METHODS: Using data from the WageIndicator web survey (N\u2009=\u20095,323), three logistic regression models were used to estimate health care employee's intention to stay for Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. The first model includes working-time characteristics controlling for a set of sociodemographic variables, job categories, promotion and organization-related characteristics. The second model tests the impact of wage-related characteristics. The third model includes both working-time- and wage-related aspects. RESULTS: Model 1 reveals that working-time-related factors significantly affect intention to stay across all countries. In particular, working part-time hours, overtime and a long commuting time decrease the intention to stay with the same employer. The analysis also shows that job dissatisfaction is a strong predictor for the intention to leave, next to being a woman, being moderately or well educated, and being promoted in the current organization. In Model 2, wage-related characteristics demonstrate that employees with a low wage or low wage satisfaction are less likely to express an intention to stay. The effect of wage satisfaction is not surprising; it confirms that besides a high wage, wage satisfaction is essential. When considering all factors in Model 3, all effects remain significant, indicating that attention to working and commuting times can complement attention to wages and wage satisfaction to increase employees' intention to stay. These findings hold for all three countries, for a variety of health occupations.",

RESULTS: A total of 205 babies met our criteria, of whom 87.3% were twins. A total of 39.5% were born following ART. A total of 30.5% of the non-ART group developed ROP vs 34% of the ART group (p = 0.837). Stage 3 ROP developed in 5.1% of non-ART babies and 6% of ART babies. A total of 8.5% of non-ART babies and 10% of ART babies required treatment for ROP. Logistic regression demonstrated that ART was not independently associated with development of ROP.",
        "output": "No, artificial reproductive technology (ART) does not appear to be an independent risk factor for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) when compared to multiple births."

        "input": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hybrid proline-rich proteins (HyPRPs) represent a large family of putative cell-wall proteins characterized by the presence of a variable N-terminal domain and a conserved C-terminal domain that is related to non-specific lipid transfer proteins. The function of HyPRPs remains unclear, but their widespread occurrence and abundant expression patterns indicate that they may be involved in a basic cellular process. METHODS: To elucidate the cellular function of HyPRPs, we modulated the expression of three HyPRP genes in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) BY-2 cell lines and in potato (Solanum tuberosum) plants. KEY RESULTS: In BY-2 lines, over-expression of the three HyPRP genes with different types of N-terminal domains resulted in similar phenotypic changes, namely increased cell elongation, both in suspension culture and on solid media where the over-expression resulted in enhanced calli size. The over-expressing cells showed increased plasmolysis in a hypertonic mannitol solution and accelerated rate of protoplast release, suggesting loosening of the cell walls. In contrast to BY-2 lines, no phenotypic changes were observed in potato plants over-expressing the same or analogous HyPRP genes, presumably due to more complex compensatory mechanisms in planta.",

We looked at the association between expectations and stereotyping of loneliness in old age and actual self-reported loneliness status 8 years later in English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). METHOD: Data from 4465 ELSA core members aged over 50 who responded to Waves 2 (2004) did not report loneliness in Wave 2, and responded to loneliness questions at least once between Waves 3 and 6 (2006-2012) were used in multivariable repeated measures logit regression analysis to estimate relationship between perceived stereotypes and expectation of loneliness in older age and actual loneliness reported within 8 years of follow-up. RESULTS: Twenty-four per cent of respondents from the analytical sample agreed at Wave 2 that old age is time of loneliness and 33% expected to be lonely in old age. Loneliness was reported by 11.5% of respondents at Waves 3-6. Both stereotypes and expectation were significantly associated with later reported loneliness (OR 2.65 (95% CI 2.05-3.42) for stereotypes and 2.98 (95% CI 2.33-3.75) for expectations in age-sex adjusted analysis). Both variables significantly predicted future loneliness even when socio-demographic circumstances were taken into account and both variables were mutually adjusted although the effect was reduced (OR's 1.53 (95% CI 1.16-2.01) for stereotypes and 2.38 (95% CI 1.84-3.07) for expectations).",

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: The theory behind the Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ) presumes that the \"objective\" social environment is measurable via self-report inventories such as the JCQ. Hence, it is expected that workers in identical work will respond highly similar. However, since no studies have evaluated this basic assumption, we decided to investigate whether workers performing highly similar work also responded similarly to the JCQ. METHODS: JCQ data from a rubber-manufacturing (RM: n\u00a0=\u00a095) and a mechanical assembly company (MA: n\u00a0=\u00a0119) were examined. On each worksite, men and women performed identical machine-paced job tasks. A population sample (n\u00a0=\u00a08,542) served as a reference group. RESULTS: In both the RM and MA groups, the job support questions were rated most similar. Yet, there was a substantial variation as regards choosing to agree or disagree with single JCQ items. The variation was also reflected in the scale scores. In the RM and MA groups, the variance of job demand and job control scores was 64-87% of that of the population sample. For job support scores, the corresponding variation was 42-87%.",
        "output": "Yes, the Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ) can be used to assess structural and organizational properties of the work environment. The results of the study showed that the variance of job demand and job control scores in the rubber-manufacturing (RM) and mechanical assembly (MA) groups was 64-87% of that of the population sample, and for job support scores it was 42-87%.

In Kenya, ER/PR/HER2 for breast cancers is not part of routine assessment and available in only three to four centers across the country. Variability in methodology and interpretation makes comparison between data difficult. Our aim was to accurately determine the prevalence of ER/PR/HER2 using standardized techniques and double reporting. Prognostic tumor parameters were also correlated with clinical features and receptor status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive invasive breast cancers (IBC) accrued between September 2011 and December 2012 were analyzed at Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi (AKUHN). Tumor blocks were stained for ER/PR/HER2 on an automated platform. Double reporting of ER/PR/HER2 was done using the Allred system and the ASCO/CAP guidelines respectively. RESULTS: A total of 301 cases of IBC were analyzed for pathology and ER/PR/HER2. The age range of patients was 19-94 years with a median of 47.5 years. Invasive ductal carcinoma (NOS) was the most common histologic type (84.2%). ER positivity was seen in 72.8%, PR in 64.8% and HER2 in 17.6% of all cases. Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) constituted 20.2% of the cases.

However, it is uncertain whether folate is causally associated with risk of ischemic stroke (IS). We aimed to examine the association between IS incidence and folate intake, biochemical folate status, and folate associated nutrients. METHODS: Information on baseline characteristics and food frequency questionnaire was collected in 1990 to 1993 and included for analyses data from 1772 adults over 40 years, who were free of stroke and cancer at baseline from the CardioVascular Disease risk FACtor Two-township Study. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was used to relate baseline nutrient status with IS event. RESULTS: Over an average of 10.6 years of follow-up, 132 incident IS events were documented. Low folate intake (1st and 2nd quartiles) was significantly and independently associated with increased IS risk (HR=1.61; 95% CI: 1.04 to 2.48 and HR=1.82; 95% CI: 1.20 to 2.76) compared with those in the 3rd and 4th quartile combined, whereas no association was observed for plasma folate concentration.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: XuanWei County, Yunnan province, has the highest lung cancer mortality rates among men and women in China. The high mortality has been linked to the use of smoky (bituminous) coal for heating and cooking. Research to date has suggested that exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is one of the main contributors to the observed risk. More recently exposure to crystalline silica has been suggested as another contributing factor. METHODS: We used data of indoor benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and silica level and lung cancer mortality at the communal level from previous reports to discuss etiological hypotheses on the lung cancer epidemics in XuanWei County. RESULTS: We estimated that PAH exposure as measured by benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) can explain a significant part of the excess risk but not fully (Odd Ratio (OR)   3 as compared to an observed OR = 8 for smoky coal users versus smokeless coal users). This leaves open the possibility of other contributing exposures. Exposure to crystalline silica however would likely only result in an increased risk (OR) of less than 1.5 and as such silica seems not to be the main exposure of interest. However, this does not exclude that risks are present because of the specific physic-chemical characteristics of the silica in smoky coal or that there is an interaction between silica and PAH exposures.",
        "output": "The results suggest that exposure to crystalline silica may not be the main contributing factor to the high lung cancer mortality rates in XuanWei County, but may still be a factor. Further research is needed to understand the specific physico-chemical characteristics of the silica in smoky coal and its interaction with PAHs to better understand the risk."

        "input": "PURPOSE: To perform a prospective pilot study to evaluate interferon alfa-2a (IFN alfa-2a) for the treatment of refractory cystoid macular edema (CME) in endogenous uveitis. METHODS: IFN alfa-2a was administered at an initial dose of 3 or 6 million IU (depending on body weight) per day subcutaneously. Afterwards IFN alfa-2a was tapered slowly over 6 months and finally discontinued. If CME relapsed IFN alfa-2a was reinstituted and tapered slowly again to evaluate the lowest maintenance dose to keep remission. RESULTS: A total of 15 eyes of 8 patients with refractory CME due to intermediate or posterior uveitis were included. Ineffective pretreatment consisted of systemic steroids and acetazolamide (all patients) and at least one additional immunosuppressant (6 patients). Six of 8 patients (11 eyes) responded well to IFN alfa-2a and CME resolved completely during 6 months treatment. One patient was lost to follow-up after IFN alfa-2a was stopped. In 1 patient (1 eye) even 19 months after cessation of IFN alfa-2a no recurrence of CME occurred. In 4 patients (8 eyes) IFN alfa-2a had to be reinstituted because CME relapsed. All 4 patients responded again. During a mean follow-up period of 16.4 months since restart of therapy we succeeded in all 4 patients to taper IFN alfa-2a to maintenance doses between 1.5 million IU every second and every sixth day without a recurrence of CME in any of the 8 eyes.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the BCS encounters for junior medical students at a large midwestern university utilizing a handheld personal digital assistant (PDA). METHODS: A core curriculum of BCS was proposed and involved 52 procedures/skills. An electronic BCS database was developed utilizing HanDBase software and then placed on a PDA (Palm) and distributed to 25 third-year medical students randomly as they entered their clinical year. Students logged their skill encounters for 9 months and then electronically transferred the database by e-mail. RESULTS: Students participated in 1,115 procedural/skill encounters (range 17 to 90; median 41; average 44.6). Of the 52 core BCS, all students performed 10.

METHODS: A retrospective medical record audit was made of non-acutely referred patients with asthma in 1994 (n=165) and in 2001 (n=133). Clinical profile data, numbers of out-patient visits and periods of in-patient care before and after asthma diagnosis were gathered from referral letters and secondary care records. RESULTS: The newly diagnosed asthma patients in 2001 were older, more obese and had more co-morbidities. The main asthma symptoms, such as dyspnoea, wheezing and cough, occurred equally in both years but were more often periodic than daily in 2001. Wheezing during auscultation was significantly less common in 2001. The diagnostic process was associated to a history of asthma in first-degree relatives (OR 5.34, 95% CI 1.12-24.49) in 1994 and a visit to a nurse prior to that to a physician (OR 3.13, 95% CI 1.17-8.37) in 2001.

We thus explored whether serum visfatin could be used as a potential diagnostic and prognostic tool for PBC, taking into account clinicopathological features, serum tumor markers, anthropometric and metabolic parameters. METHODS: Serum visfatin, tumor marker CA 15-3, carcinoembryonic antigen, metabolic and anthropometric parameters were determined in 103 postmenopausal women with pathologically confirmed, incident invasive breast cancer, 103 controls matched on age and time of diagnosis, and 51 patients with benign breast lesions (BBL). RESULTS: Mean serum visfatin was significantly higher in cases than in controls and patients with BBL (p<0.001). In cases, visfatin was significantly associated with CA 15-3 (p=0.03), hormone-receptor status (p<0.001), lymph node invasion (p=0.06) but not with metabolic and anthropometric variables (p>0.05). Multivariable regression analysis revealed that absence of estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER-PR-) was the strongest significant determinant of serum visfatin (p<0.001) in cases adjusting for demographic, metabolic and clinicopathological features. Based upon receiver operator characteristic analysis, serum visfatin outperformed CA 15-3 only in discriminating between PBC cases with early cancer stage than those with late stage, and in differentiating particularly patients with ER-PR- breast tumors.",

However, public sector mental health services and private psychiatrists do not always work well together and there seem to be a number of barriers to effective collaboration. This study set out to investigate the extent of collaborative 'shared care' arrangements between a public mental health service and private psychiatrists practising nearby. It also examined possible barriers to collaboration and some possible solutions to the identified problems. METHOD: A questionnaire examining the above factors was sent to all public sector mental health clinicians and all private psychiatrists in the area. RESULTS: One hundred and five of the 154 (68.2%) public sector clinicians and 103 of the 194 (53.1%) private psychiatrists returned surveys. The main barriers to successful collaboration identified by members of both sectors were: 'Difficulty communicating' endorsed by 71.4% of public clinicians and 72% of private psychiatrists, 'Confusion of roles and responsibilities' endorsed by 62.9% and 66%, respectively, and 'Different treatment approach' by 47.6% and 45.6%, respectively. Over 60% of private psychiatrists identified problems with access to the public system as a barrier to successful shared care arrangements. It also emerged, as hypothesized, that the public and private systems tend to manage different patient populations and that public clinicians in particular are not fully aware of the private psychiatrists' range of expertise. This would result in fewer referrals for shared care across the sectors.",

In ImRS exercises, patients sometimes suggest taking violent revenge on perpetrators. However, it is unclear whether vengeful phantasies can be particularly helpful in giving back feelings of power and control, or whether they rather increase aggressive feelings, with potentially harmful effects. METHODS: Forty-six healthy participants watched 3 trauma movie segments depicting interpersonal violence. After each movie, one of 3 ImRS strategies (ImRS with violent revenge, ImRS without violence, safe place imagery) was applied. Dependent variables were subjective emotion ratings. RESULTS: Aggressive and positive emotions changed most strongly with the safe place image, no differences between ImRS with and without violence were observed. Sad and anxious emotions were not differently influenced by different strategies. LIMITATIONS: Only a healthy sample with no previous display of aggression has been investigated. Cross-over effects cannot be excluded due to the within-group design with repeated trauma movie segments.",

Modern ultrasound systems now use harmonic imaging (HI) because of the improved LV endomyocardial definition. However, the 2005 American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) recommendations noted that the applicability of the reference values to HI-derived measurements has not been established. METHODS: LVM and LV end-diastolic volume, diameter, and wall thickness were determined using HI in healthy subjects (n = 251), including normal-weight (NW) (body mass index<25 kg/m\u00b2, n = 149, 68% women) and otherwise healthy, overweight (OW) (body mass index \u2265 25 and<30 kg/m\u00b2, n = 102, 41% women) groups. Measurements were compared with ASE-endorsed reference values. The agreement between FI and HI was determined in a prospective cohort of 51 subjects. RESULTS: Two-dimensional (2D) derived LV volumes were similar between NW and OW subjects, although M-mode (MM)-derived LV diameters were slightly greater in OW subjects. 2D and MM-derived LVM was greater in OW compared with NW subjects, including after adjustment by height or height\u00b2\u00b7\u2077; however, indexing to body surface area eliminated these differences. The partition values for abnormal 2D and MM-derived LVM were generally greater in NW and OW subjects of both sexes compared with the ASE-endorsed values (except MM-derived LVM in NW men). However, there were no significant differences in LVM determined by HI compared with FI in a prospectively studied cohort.",

RESULTS: Thirty-four patients were identified as delirious and 95 as anaemic according to the WHO criteria. Stepwise logistic regression revealed that anaemia (haemoglobin level<12 g/l in women and<13 g/l in men), male sex and a diagnosis of dementia were independent risk factors for delirium in the total study group. After adjustment for sex, age, diagnosis of dementia and dehydration, the odds ratio (OR) for anaemia (2.4; 95 CI = 1.02-5.54) remained significantly associated with delirium. When the study population was classified in groups according to sex, anaemia remained a significant risk factor for delirium in men (OR = 3.7; 95% CI = 1.03-15.6) after adjustment for the multiple variables but not in women (OR = 1.54; 95% CI = 0.48-4.9).

This hypothesis may suggest a beneficial effect of antibiotics in CD therapy. So far, guidelines do not recommend antibiotics except in the treatment of complicated CD, and there are few studies on the effects of rifaximin in these patients. METHODS: Between December 2011 and December 2012, we performed a blinded randomized trial in 168 patients with a previous history of moderately active CD concerning the efficacy of rifaximin. All the patients had previously achieved remission with standard therapy (prednisone/budesonide).

An ideal antiadipose agent induces a potent decrease of body mass on the account of fat depot, it can be administered for a prolonged time without developing resistance, it should not be accompanied by significant side effects, and it has no negative effects on the obesity-related diseases. ANTI- OBESITY AGENTS: Nowadays, there are mainly two groups of drugs in use, having different mechanisms of action: appetite suppressors and fat resorption inhibitors. From the first group of drugs the most suitable is dexfenfluramine, which is applied in obese nervous and tense subjects and in cases of compulsive food intake whereas fat resorption inhibitors (tetrahydrolipstatin, orlistat) are especially recommended to obese patients with accompanying hyperlipoproteinemia. Insulin-dependent form of diabetes is an indication for administration of drugs from this group.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Preservation of spontaneous breathing (SB) is sometimes debated because it has potentially both negative and positive effects on lung injury in comparison with fully controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV). We wanted (1) to verify in mechanically ventilated patients if the change in transpulmonary pressure was similar between pressure support ventilation (PSV) and CMV for a similar tidal volume, (2) to estimate the influence of SB on alveolar pressure (Palv), and (3) to determine whether a reliable plateau pressure could be measured during pressure support ventilation (PSV). METHODS: We studied ten patients equipped with esophageal catheters undergoing three levels of PSV followed by a phase of CMV. For each condition, we calculated the maximal and mean transpulmonary (\u0394PL) swings and Palv. RESULTS: Overall, \u0394PL was similar between CMV and PSV, but only loosely correlated. The differences in \u0394PL between CMV and PSV were explained largely by different inspiratory flows, indicating that the resistive pressure drop caused this difference. By contrast, the Palv profile was very different between CMV and SB; SB led to progressively more negative Palv during inspiration, and Palv became lower than the set positive end-expiratory pressure in nine of ten patients at low PSV. Finally, inspiratory occlusion holds performed during PSV led to plateau and \u0394 PL pressures comparable with those measured during CMV.",

In England, a new national 3-day training programme called 'Connected' has been developed and is now mandatory for all cancer and palliative care professionals. This study aimed to explore the attitudes of staff in one region to undertaking this training. METHODS AND SAMPLE: A survey questionnaire was developed through a series of discussions with experts and semi-structured interviews with five healthcare professionals. The questionnaire was distributed to 200 cancer and palliative care staff; 109 were completed and returned. KEY RESULTS: There were significant differences between doctors' and nurses' attitudes to communication skills training, with doctors demonstrating more negative attitudes. More nurses than doctors felt that communication skills training should be mandatory for cancer and palliative care professionals (p \u2264 0.001), whilst more doctors felt that these staff should already be skilled communicators and not require further training (p \u2264 0.001). Nurses also self-rated their communication skills more highly than doctors.",

A sample of 84 (18% of all non-responders) was included. The main outcome measures were self-reported smoking behaviour at the time of the interview and at the time of the routine follow-up. Also, reasons for not responding to the original follow-up questionnaire were assessed. For statistical comparison between groups we used Fischer's exact test, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) on proportions and OR. RESULTS: Thirty-nine percent reported to have been smoke-free at the time they received the original questionnaire compared with 31% of responders in the original study population. The two most common reasons stated for not having returned the original questionnaire was claiming that they had returned it (35%) and that they had not received the questionnaire (20%). Non-responders were somewhat younger and were to a higher degree smoke-free when they first called the quitline.",
        "output": "No, non-responders in a quitline evaluation are not necessarily more likely to be smokers."

This paired approach may not always be possible. We simulated whether F and the absorption rate constant (ka) could be estimated accurately for a drug with low variance using different patients for nonintravenous and intravenous routes and whether sparse sampling permitted accurate estimates. METHODS: Using pharmacokinetic parameters for cisatracurium besylate (INN, cisatracurium besilate), we simulated data sets representing 20 administrations (10 intravenous and 10 nonintravenous) with either three (sparse) or 16 (extensive) samples per administration. Simulations were performed twice, with ka values of 0.1 (slow absorption) or 0.3 (rapid absorption) min-1. With use of NONMEM, we estimated F and ka for each data set using both two-stage and mixed-effects modeling approaches and paired and unpaired designs to determine the percentage of estimates that deviated>25% from the simulated value. RESULTS: Estimates of F with extensive data were satisfactory for all approaches. With sparse sampling, two-stage analysis of unpaired data were not possible, two-stage analysis of paired data yielded erroneous estimates, and mixed-effects modeling gave satisfactory estimates. Estimates of ka were sometimes erroneous with all approaches except for paired analysis of extensive data with slow absorption; sparse data and two-stage analysis increased the likelihood of errors compared with extensive data and mixed-effects modeling.",

We theorized that personality measures of depression, anxiety, hostility, social isolation, and substance abuse would predict CHD development in psychiatric inpatients. METHOD: We used a longitudinal database of psychological test data from 349 Veterans first admitted to a psychiatric unit between October 1, 1983, and September 30, 1987. Veterans Affairs and national databases were assessed to determine the development of new-onset chronic CHD over the intervening 16-year period. RESULTS: New-onset CHD developed in 154 of the 349 (44.1%) subjects. Thirty-one psychometric variables from five personality tests significantly predicted the development of CHD. We performed a factor analysis of these variables because they overlapped and four factors emerged, with positive adaptive functioning the only significant factor (OR=0.798, p=0.038).",

California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) have experienced recurrent outbreaks of leptospirosis since 1970, but it is unknown whether the pathogen persists in the sea lion population or is introduced repeatedly from external reservoirs. METHODS: We analyzed serum samples collected over an 11-year period from 1344 California sea lions that stranded alive on the California coast, using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) for antibodies to Leptospira interrogans serovar Pomona. We evaluated seroprevalence among yearlings as a measure of incidence in the population, and characterized antibody persistence times based on temporal changes in the distribution of titer scores. We conducted multinomial logistic regression to determine individual risk factors for seropositivity with high and low titers. RESULTS: The serosurvey revealed cyclical patterns in seroprevalence to L. interrogans serovar Pomona, with 4-5 year periodicity and peak seroprevalence above 50%. Seroprevalence in yearling sea lions was an accurate index of exposure among all age classses, and indicated on-going exposure to leptospires in non-outbreak years. Analysis of titer decay rates showed that some individuals probably maintain high titers for more than a year following exposure.",
        "output": "The serosurvey results indicate that leptospirosis is endemic in California sea lions, with periodic outbreaks of the disease in the population. The periodic nature of the outbreaks and the high seroprevalence in yearlings suggests that the pathogen is maintained in the sea lion population and is not introduced from external reservoirs. The persistence of antibodies in some individuals suggests that leptospires may be able to establish a chronic infection in this host species."

        "input": "BACKGROUND: A biomarker of hypoxic exposure would be useful in clinical diagnosis and prognosis. Acute hypoxia stimulates large increases in serum erythropoietin (EPO), and EPO induces formation of characteristic enlarged red blood cells (RBCs). The presence of large RBCs perturbs red cell distribution width (RDW). METHODS: Using a>2M patient medical claims database, the human pathome was scanned for diseases where RDW rose 0-50days following a new diagnosis. The course of RDW after selected diagnoses was visualized by registering RDW measurements by diagnosis date. RESULTS: Acute hemorrhage, which provokes EPO-driven erythropoiesis, is followed by increases in RDW but not mean cell volume (MCV). Similar RDW increases follow many acute diseases with risk of hypoxia, including heart failure, pneumonia, atelectasis, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, and sepsis. Elevations reach maximum within 1month after onset and subside to pre-disease levels about 6months later. Unlike the case with iron-deficiency anemia (IDA), RDW elevations after hypoxia-associated diseases are unaccompanied by discernible change in average RBC size.",
        "output": "The results of this study suggest that persistent increases in red cell size distribution width after acute diseases may be a useful biomarker of hypoxemia. This is in contrast to iron-deficiency anemia, where the presence of large red blood cells is a hallmark of the disease. The results of this study suggest that the presence of large red blood cells may be indicative of hypoxia, and could potentially be used as a biomarker for hypoxic exposure."

We hypothesized that BAL would decrease the number of cases of VAP diagnosed and impact our antibiotic use and ventilator days. METHODS: Prospective data on all infectious complications were collected for patients admitted to the trauma-burn service for the year 2001. All VAPs between January 1, 2001, through June 30, 2001, were diagnosed without BAL (No BAL group) using clinical signs of fever, sputum production, leukocytosis, chest radiographs, and sputum culture. After July 1, 2001, VAP was diagnosed with the use of BAL. RESULTS: There were 37 cases of VAP in the No BAL group (11%) and 29 cases of VAP (8%) in the BAL group. There were no statistical differences in Injury Severity Score, hospital length of stay, ventilator days, or mortality between the two groups. The time to initial treatment of VAP was shorter for the BAL group, but did not reach significance. The number of patients who had their VAP pathogens correctly treated with empiric antibiotics was also the same between the two groups. There was no difference in the rate of recurrent pneumonias.

However, do all SZ patients need antipsychotics indefinitely? Are there factors that help to identify which SZ patients can enter into prolonged periods of recovery without antipsychotics? This 20-year longitudinal research studied these issues. METHOD: A total of 139 early young psychotic patients from the Chicago Follow-up Study, including 70 patients with SZ syndromes and 69 with mood disorders, were assessed, prospectively, at the acute phase and then followed up six times over the next 20 years. Patients were assessed with standardized instruments for major symptoms, psychosocial functioning, personality, attitudinal variables, neurocognition and treatment. RESULTS: At each follow-up, 30-40% of SZ patients were no longer on antipsychotics. Starting at the 4.5-year follow-ups and continuing thereafter, SZ patients not on antipsychotics for prolonged periods were significantly less likely to be psychotic and experienced more periods of recovery; they also had more favorable risk and protective factors. SZ patients off antipsychotics for prolonged periods did not relapse more frequently.",

Thus, we aimed to examine the relation of KR to mortality risk among patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) focusing on identifying biases that may threaten the validity of prior studies. METHODS: We included knee OA subjects (ages 50-89\u2005years) from The Health Improvement Network, an electronic medical records database in the UK. Risk of mortality among KR subjects was compared with propensity score-matched non-KR subjects. To explore residual confounding bias, subgroup analyses stratified by age and propensity scores were performed. RESULTS: Subjects with KR had 28% lower risk of mortality than non-KR subjects (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.78). However, when stratified by age, protective effect was noted only in older age groups (>63\u2005years) but not in younger subjects (\u226463\u2005years). Further, the mortality rate among KR subjects decreased as candidacy (propensity score) for KR increased among subjects with KR, but no such consistent trend was noted among non-KR subjects.",

OBJECTIVES: To test the link between periodontal disease in pregnant women and low birth weight or prematurity. METHODS: A population-based, cross-sectional study was carried out in Southern Brazil. The sample consisted of 449 parturients who were interviewed and examined up to 48 h post-partum. Three outcomes were investigated: low birth weight, prematurity and prematurity and/or birth weight. Periodontal disease, the exposure, was defined as (i) at least one site with a periodontal pocket; (ii) the presence of pockets at four or more sites. Socio-demographic information relating to health and maternal habits was collected through a questionnaire and by hospital medical records. Simple and multiple regression analysis was performed. FINDINGS: There was no statistically significant association between periodontal disease and low birth weight. Periodontal pocket was not associated with low birth weight and/or pre-term birth after being adjusted. A periodontal pocket in at least one site was associated with prematurity (odds ratio=2.6; 95% confidence interval 1.0-6.9) even after adjusting for maternal schooling, parity, number of previous children of low birth weight, number of pre-natal consultations and body mass index.

        "input": "PURPOSE: Modern metal-on-metal (MoM) joint articulations releases metal ions to the body. Research tries to establish how much this elevates metal ion levels and whether it causes adverse effects. The steel needle that samples the blood may introduce additional chromium to the sample thereby causing bias. This study aimed to test that theory. METHODS: We compared serum chromium values for two sampling methods, steel needle and IV plastic cannula, as well as sampling sequence in 16 healthy volunteers. RESULTS: We found statistically significant chromium contamination from the steel needle with mean differences between the two methods of 0.073 ng/mL, for the first sample, and 0.033 ng/mL for the second. No difference was found between the first and second plastic sample. The first steel needle sample contained an average of 0.047 ng/mL more than the second. This difference was only borderline significant.",
        "output": "No, the method of sampling does not appear to significantly affect the levels of chromium in the blood. The differences between the two methods were not significant for either the first or second sample, and the difference between the first and second sample was only borderline significant. Therefore, it appears that the method of sampling does not significantly affect the levels of chromium in the blood."

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association between obesity and depressive symptoms in a diverse, school-based sample of preadolescent children, and to examine whether overweight concerns play a role in this association. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Third-grade students (N = 868, mean age, 8.4 years) attending 13 public elementary schools in Northern California were measured for weight and height, and were asked to complete self-report assessments of depressive symptoms and overweight concerns. RESULTS: A modest association between depressive symptoms and body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) was found for girls (r = 0.14, P<.01), but not for boys (r = 0.01, P<.78). Among girls, depressive symptoms were strongly associated with overweight concerns (r = 0.32, P<.001). After controlling for level of overweight concerns, BMI was no longer significantly associated with depressive symptoms among girls. In contrast, after controlling for BMI, overweight concerns remained significantly associated with depressive symptoms.",

Patients with atrial fibrillation or cardiac thrombus have a higher risk of recurrent emboli than those without these risk factors. This study examines the importance of long-term anticoagulation in these 2 groups. DESIGN: A review of patients presenting with acute limb ischemia over a 5-year period (1994-1999). SETTING: A university-affiliated medical centre. PATIENTS: Fifty patients divided into 2 groups: 19 (38%) patients with atrial fibrillation (group 1) and 31 (62%) patients with no atrial fibrillation or cardiac thrombus (group 2) as confirmed by transthoracic echocardiography. INTERVENTION: All patients underwent surgical thromboembolectomy and received postoperative anticoagulant therapy. OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality, limb loss, further thromboembolic events and bleeding complications as determined by telephone survey. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in 5-year survival (group 1, 84%; group 2, 64%) and early limb loss (group 1, 0%; group 2, 13%). Further thromboembolic events and bleeding complications were rare but were more common in group 1. In group 2 there were no instances of recurrent thromboemboli and no bleeding complications although only 39% of patients in this group were taking angicoagulants at the end of the study period.",

A biphasic protocol was performed including arteriographic acquisition at standard 120 kVp and a late-arterial scan at 100 kVp (n=9) or 80 kVp (n=7). Images were reconstructed under various algorithms. Signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios (SNR, CNR) were determined within stent, aorta and renal arteries. Image quality and the presence of restenosis were assessed. Volume CT dose-index was recorded and dose reduction (DR%) between phases was calculated. RESULTS: Ten patients presented with Hounsfield values>250 HU in all segments, phases and reconstructions and were further evaluated. The 120 kVp protocol performed better in all vessels and reconstruction algorithms. SNR at 120 kVp (B31f) did not differ significantly compared to 100 kVp (B31f). CNR within stent was borderline compromised at 100 kVp (p=0.042). All but two image sets (at 80 kVp) were considered diagnostic. Minor loss of subjective image quality was noticed at 100 kVp.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A MEDLINE search (January 1966-July 2007) was conducted to identify observational studies that examined the association between combination therapy of sulfonylureas and metformin on risk of CVD or all-cause mortality. From 299 relevant reports, 9 were included in the meta-analysis. In these studies, combination therapy of metformin and sulfonylurea was assessed, the risk of CVD and/or mortality was reported, and adjusted relative risk (RR) or equivalent (hazard ratio and odds ratio) and corresponding variance or equivalent was reported. RESULTS: The pooled RRs (95% CIs) of outcomes for individuals with type 2 diabetes prescribed combination therapy of sulfonylureas and metformin were 1.19 (0.88-1.62) for all-cause mortality, 1.29 (0.73-2.27) for CVD mortality, and 1.43 (1.10-1.85) for a composite end point of CVD hospitalizations or mortality (fatal or nonfatal events).",

While T-plate fixation was the method of choice until the end of the 1980s, minimally invasive techniques have been favoured during the past decade. The indication for primary shoulder prosthesis is controversial. The purpose of this report was to evaluate the scientific evidence of current treatment recommendations. METHODS: Relevant articles were retrieved from \"Medline\" and \"Knowledge-Finder\" using the combined search strategy for the keywords \"proximal humerus\" and \"fracture\". Retrieved articles were evaluated according to the criteria of evidence-based medicine. RESULTS: The analysis retrieved 3 randomized, 4 prospective, and 26 retrospective studies and a number of review articles relevant to the subject. Limitations of most publications were due to small study populations, differences in patient selection and fracture classification as well as measurements of outcome. According to these studies good functional results can be achieved in dislocated two-part fractures treated with minimal osteosynthesis in the elderly and T-plate fixation in younger patients. For three- and four-part fractures minimally invasive techniques seem to be more favourable in the elderly. However, there is some evidence that alternative therapies such as conservative treatment and plating can be successful in defined populations. A general indication for primary implantation of a prosthesis in four-part fractures in the elderly is not supported by the literature.",

RESULTS: Cesarean sections were performed in 52% of the \"predicted\" group deliveries and in 30% of the \"not predicted\" group (p<0.01). The increased cesarean delivery rate in the predicted group appeared to be related to an increased incidence of labor inductions (42.5% vs 26.6%, p = 0.005) and a greater proportion of failed inductions. The proportion of patients delivered by cesarean section without a trial of labor was similar in the predicted and not predicted groups (14.7% vs 10.2%, p = 0.21).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively followed 41 patients (35 men, six women) 60 years of age or younger undergoing TKA with uncemented trabecular metal tibial components. Patients underwent dual-energy xray absorptiometry scans of both proximal tibiae preoperatively and at 2 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperatively. We determined bone mineral density in three selected regions of interest (Zone 1, between the pegs; Zone 2, beneath the pegs; Zone 3, directly below entire baseplate). Precision analysis revealed a precision error of 4% or less for each region of interest, indicating adequate power to detect bone mineral density changes of 8% or greater. RESULTS: Bone mineral density percent change was different between the operative and nonoperative knees only in Zone 3 and only at 2 months. There was no change in bone mineral density in any zone in the nonoperative knee at any time. Only in Zone 3 did the bone mineral density decrease at 2 months in the operative knee.",

They have been implicated in a range of diseases including cancer, with most information pertaining to their function in tumourigenesis being derived from in vitro studies, or model organisms. Their putative roles as tumour suppressors or tumour promoters remain to be validated in vivo. Little is known about their role in breast tumourigenesis. We sought to evaluate the seven sirtuin family members (SIRT1-7) in a human breast cancer cohort, in relation to clinico-pathological features and outcome of the disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemical analysis of SIRT1-7 protein levels was undertaken in 392 oestrogen receptor (ER+ve) and 153 ER-ve breast tumour samples. SIRT1-7 transcriptional levels were assessed in normal (n=25), non-malignant (n=73) and malignant (n=70) breast tissue using Relative Quantitative Real Time PCR. Statistical analyses determined if SIRT1-7 transcription or protein expression was associated with clinical parameters or outcome. RESULTS: In ER-ve tumours, high protein levels of nuclear SIRT2 were associated with reduced time to recurrence and disease-specific death. This association was only observed in Grade 3 tumours. In the ER+ve cohort, high SIRT2 nuclear levels were associated with shorter disease-free survival and time to recurrence whilst on Tamoxifen, in patients with Grade 3 tumours. Conversely, in Grade 2 tumours, high SIRT2 levels were associated with increased time to recurrence.",

RESULTS: The findings revealed that the risk of teachers to develop psychiatric disorders is 2-, 2.5-, and 3-fold higher than that of clerks, health care professionals and blue collars, respectively. Age or sex did not represent a confounding factor for increased rate of psychiatric disorders. Interestingly, teachers also presented an approximately 1.5-2 fold higher risk of developing neoplasms, compared with clerks and blue collars.",
        "output": "Yes, there is a correlation between psychiatric disease and the teaching profession. Teachers have a higher risk of developing psychiatric disorders compared to other professionals, such as clerks and blue collars. Additionally, the risk of teachers developing psychiatric disorders is 2-3 times higher than the risk of other professionals."

METHODS: Longitudinal cohort analysis of consecutive admissions to a specialized in-patient rehabilitation unit. SELECTION CRITERIA: patients who were highly dependent on admission (NPDS>or = 25) and had a length of stay>125 days. Serial changes in dependency and care costs were measured by the Northwick Park Dependency and Care Needs Assessment (NPDS/NPCNA), which provides a generic estimation of dependency, care hours and weekly cost of continuing care in the community. RESULTS: Of 410 admissions over 5 years, 51 met the case-selection criteria - mean age 39 +/- 17 years, male:female ratio 2:1. The mean length of stay (LOS) was 184 +/- 56 days (max 312).

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Injuries from terror and war are not necessarily comparable, especially among civilians and soldiers. For example, civilians have less direct exposure to conflict and are unprepared for injury, whereas soldiers are psychologically and physically prepared for combat on battlefields that are often far from trauma centers. Evidence-based studies distinguishing and characterizing differences in injuries according to conflict type and population group are lacking. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed using hospitalization data from the Israel National Trauma Registry (10/2000-12/2006). RESULTS: Terror and war accounted for trauma hospitalizations among 1784 civilians and 802 soldiers. Most civilians (93%) were injured in terror and transferred to trauma centers by land, whereas soldiers were transferred by land and air. Critical injuries and injuries to multiple body regions were more likely in terror than war. Soldiers tended to present with less severe injuries from war than from terror. Rates of first admission to orthopedic surgery were greater for all casualties with the exception of civilians injured in terror who were equally likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit. In-hospital mortality was higher among terror (7%) than war (2%) casualties, and particularly among civilians.",

We therefore set out to evaluate the presence and severity of sensorineural hearing loss in sickle cell anemia (SCA) patients in the light of the overall improvement in the morbidity and mortality. METHODS: A prospective case control study of SCA patients attending our adult SCA clinic and control subjects from homozygous hemoglobin AA patients attending the staff clinic of the hospital for routine medical tests. Tympanometry and diagnostic audiometry were performed on each patient. MAIN FINDINGS: Forty-six SCA patients (21 males, 45.7%) aged 16-48 years with a mean age of 22.9 years +/- 6.45 and 42 controls (24 males, 57.1%) aged 15-39 years with a mean age of 23.7 years +/- 5.69 were included in this study. The average hearing thresholds of SCA patients were consistently higher than controls in all frequencies tested in both right and left ears. Of the 92 ears of SCA patients tested, 95.7% exhibited hearing thresholds within normal limits, and 4.3% had mild hearing loss. The controls had thresholds within normal limits.",

METHODS: We enrolled 60 consecutive patients admitted to the critical care unit with the diagnosis of first acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction presenting within 24 hours from symptom onset, and eligible for reperfusion therapy. All patients received streptokinase in the usual dose regimen. Patients underwent resting high-quality 12-lead electrocardiogram recordings to calculate the modified QRS score and estimate the sum of ST segment elevation before (STE1) and 90 minutes after (STE2) streptokinase. The difference between STE1 and STE2 was then measured and accepted as the sum of ST segment resolution, expressed as SigmaSTR. Patients were classified into two groups: those with SigmaSTR>or = 50% of STE1 (the resolution group) and those with SigmaSTR<50% (the non-resolution group). RESULTS: The mean QRS score was significantly lower in the resolution group compared to the non-resolution group (2.88 +/- 1.34 vs 5.93 +/- 1.56, respectively, p<0.001). There was a highly significant negative correlation between QRS score and SSTR with a correlation coefficient r = -0.76.

OBJECTIVES: To develop a diagnostic screening guideline for ROP that would safely reduce the number of ROP screening funduscopies in our department. METHODS: Data of 275 infants admitted between 1996 and 2000 and screened for ROP according to our Dutch National guideline were studied. Significant risk factors for ROP were calculated, using logistic regression analysis and used to develop a guideline. The discriminative power of the guideline was evaluated using the area under the curve for the receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: Significant risk factors for ROP were: gestational age, birth weight and number of erythrocyte transfusions within the first 4 weeks of life. The combination of these 3 factors resulted in the highest area under the curve: 0.793. Using these 3 factors, a diagnostic screening guideline for ROP was developed: if birth weight + 2 x (gestational age - 20) - 6 x erythrocyte transfusion value within the first 4 weeks of life>or=34, no screening for ROP is necessary. Using this guideline, 22.2% of the infants of the study group could have been excluded from screening; 3.8% of the infants with ROP stages 1-2 would have been missed.",

Our aim was to study true incidence of SSI in spinal surgery by significant data collection, and to compare it with the results obtained through the hospital information system. METHODS: This work is a single center prospective cohort study that included all patients consecutively operated on for spinal instrumentation by posterior approach over a six-month period regardless the etiology. For all patients, a \"high definition\" prospective method of surveillance was performed by the infection control (IC) department during at least 12 months after surgery. Results were then compared with findings from automatic surveillance though the hospital information system (HIS). RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-four patients were included. We found no hardly difference between \"high definition\" and automatic surveillance through the HIS, even if HIS tended to under-estimate the infection rate: rate of surgical site infection was 2.60% and gross SSI incidence rate via the hospital information system was 1.95%. Smoking and alcohol consumption were significantly related to a SSI.",

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the completeness of official data sources on traffic related injuries (TRIs) by using the capture-recapture technique and to calculate an ascertainment corrected number of fatal and serious TRIs among Scottish young people aged 15-24 years. The appropriateness of the approach in this context is also assessed. METHOD: A two sample capture-recapture technique was applied to two official sources of TRI data. Data on TRIs were obtained from the Scottish Health Service and the STATS19 dataset at the University of Essex Data Archive for 1995. Four standards (A-D) of matching were applied to fatalities and serious TRIs to allow plausible relaxation of matching standards within the context of the data collection setting. The completeness of each data source was assessed, and an ascertainment corrected number of fatalities and serious TRIs calculated. RESULTS: The ascertainment corrected number of TRI fatalities among 15-24 year olds using standard D was 104. This represents only a small increase in the number of fatalities using capture-recapture than when using each individual dataset. The completeness of the Scottish Health Service database for TRI fatalities was 93%. The STATS19 database was 95% complete. The ascertainment corrected number of TRI hospital admissions was 1969. The STATS19 and the Scottish Health Service databases were approximately two thirds and three quarters complete respectively for non-fatal TRIs requiring hospitalisation.",

METHODS: Five formalin-fixed cadaveric heads injected with colored silicone underwent thin-cut computed tomographic scanning for bony and vascular analysis. The ICA's intracranial course viewed by transnasal endoscopic dissection was compared with the view of a bilateral frontotemporal crantiotomy, from the petrous (C2) to communicating (C7) segments. RESULTS: Refinement of our 1996 ICA classification provides an anatomical understanding for endoscopic exposures transnasally along an inferior skull base trajectory. The changing course of the ICA, initially termed loop is now termed bend (i.e., implying a change in direction). Four bends are described as the ICA enters into the skull base as C2, C3-C4, C4, and C4-C5.

A radio system used by UK police (TETRA) employs signals which pulse at 17.6 Hz. We tested whether exposure to a continuous wave signal at 385.25 MHz or a TETRA-like signal resulted in symptoms among users reporting sensitivity to TETRA compared to users not reporting sensitivity to TETRA. METHODS: 60 sensitive and 60 non-sensitive users were exposed to three 50 min conditions: a signal with a 16 Hz component, a continuous wave condition and a sham condition. The mean radiated power for the 16 Hz and continuous wave conditions was 250 mW. The order of conditions was randomised and testing was conducted double-blind. Participants reported the severity of eight symptoms during and after each exposure, their mood state at the end of each exposure, and whether they could tell which sessions involved active signals. The study was registered in advance with the ISRCTN register. RESULTS: Exposure to the continuous wave signal increased ratings of headache in all participants, fatigue in non-sensitive participants and difficulty concentrating in sensitive participants. Paradoxically, it reduced sensations of itching in sensitive participants. These effects were not observed in the condition with 16 Hz pulsing, except for those relating to concentration. Adjusting for multiple comparisons removed most significant effects, but not those relating to itch.",

Regardless of the cause, we hypothesized that damaged epithelial cells in the atrophic acini could be a source of the elevation of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The aim of this study was to find any possible association between the extent of prostatic atrophy in needle biopsies and serum PSA level. METHODS: The study was based on 131 needle prostatic biopsies corresponding to 107 patients. The only diagnosis in all biopsies was focal prostatic atrophy without the presence of cancer, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, or areas suspicious for cancer. The extent of atrophy was measured in two ways: the linear extent in millimeters and the percentage of linear extent showing atrophy for each biopsy. Spearman's coefficient of rank correlation was used to evaluate the association of atrophy extent with total and free serum PSA levels. RESULTS: A positive and statistically significant correlation was found between the linear atrophy extent and the total serum PSA level (r = 0.25, P =<0.01) and free PSA level (r = 0.23, P = 0.01).

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: To quantitate the risk of clinically significant renal function deterioration after radical cystectomy (RC), which could result in supratherapeutic levels of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and increased risk of bleeding events with the use of extended pharmacologic venous thromboembolism prophylaxis (EPVTEP) after hospital discharge. METHODS: Patients undergoing RC between 2006 and 2011 were identified from the institutional registry. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated and categorized as preoperative, discharge, and nadir. Perioperative eGFR trends in patients who would have been candidates for EPVTEP were evaluated. RESULTS: Three hundred four patients with eGFR>30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) at the time of hospital discharge were included in the analysis as potentially eligible for EPVTEP. Large portion of patients (43%) exhibited decline in eGFR after discharge. Importantly, 13.0% of patients (n = 40), who would have qualified for EPVTEP at discharge, experienced nadir GFR below the 30-mL/min/1.73 m(2) threshold value at which LMWH would have become supratherapeutic. The odds ratio for developing a GFR<30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) was 9.1 (95% confidence interval, 4.3-19.3; P<.001), comparing those with a discharge GFR \u226560 mL/min/1.73 m(2) with those with a discharge GFR<60 mL/min/1.73 m(2).",
        "output": "No, extended pharmacologic venous thromboembolism prophylaxis is not uniformly safe after radical cystectomy. In fact, a significant portion of patients (13%) who would have qualified for extended pharmacologic venous thromboembolism prophylaxis at discharge experienced a decline in renal function below the threshold value at which LMWH would have become supratherapeutic."

Management of such a problem is still controversial and is associated with many surgical details, due not only to the nonunited fracture itself, but also to the broken implant which is not easy to remove. METHODS: This study is a randomized prospective study presenting 40 patients with aseptic nonunited fracture shaft femur associated with failed plating managed by the removal of hardware, and intramedullary fixation using an interlocking nail with or without autogenous iliac bone graft. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between patients with and without iliac autogenous bone graft regarding the demographic data, the preoperative condition, and the postoperative course including time needed for bone union and return to work. The statistically significant difference was in the intraoperative blood loss and the duration of surgery with less blood loss and shorter duration of surgery occurring in the group treated by reamed intramedullary nail without iliac bone graft.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Clinical trial evidence shows minimal survival gains and higher complication rates from radical prostatectomy (RP) versus watchful waiting (WW) for elderly men with localized prostate cancer (PCa). It is believed that these patients are overtreated. The current analyses aim to explore patient-level heterogeneity in survival effects, examine matching of patients to treatments in practice, and identify patient characteristics driving heterogenous effects, in order to present more comprehensive evidence about the concerns of overtreatment. METHODS: Eleven-year all-cause and PCa-specific survival among SEER-Medicare patients diagnosed during 1996-2002 were analyzed using local instrumental variable approaches. RESULTS: A total of 8462 (77%) of 11,036 patients received RP. The average effects of RP over WW on 11-year overall and cancer-specific survival were 1.1 months (95%CI, -25, 28; P=0.94) and 1.7 months (95%CI, -25, 29; P=0.90) respectively; effects did not differ significantly according to age, race, grade, and stage. Fewer than 1% of patients had significant cancer-specific survival benefit from RP at the 10% level; 6% were expected to gain over 15 months from RP. However, patients with larger expected survival gains from RP were much more likely to receive RP in practice. Such positive self-selection was driven by PCa-specific survival than overall survival. Several comorbidities may play a critical role in predicting who could benefit from RP.",
        "output": "The results of this study suggest that elderly patients with localized prostate cancer are not being overtreated, as evidenced by similar survival outcomes between those who receive radical prostatectomy and those who choose watchful waiting. However, patients who are more likely to benefit from radical prostatectomy are more likely to receive it in practice, suggesting that there may be potential for overtreatment in some cases."

However, because of residual concerns about cimetidine-induced neutropenia, a study was conducted to evaluate this association. METHODS: A population-based, case-control study was undertaken using a large database with Medicaid data from six states. Cases were defined as patients hospitalized with a discharge diagnosis of neutropenia. Medical records were sought to validate the diagnoses of neutropenia and to characterize the severity of disease. Four controls were randomly selected for each case, matched for age, sex, state, and year of diagnosis. The frequency of exposures to cimetidine in the 30 days prior to hospital admission in the cases was compared to that in the identical time periods in the controls. RESULTS: When investigators simultaneously controlled for multiple, potentially confounding variables by using conditional logistic regression, the odds ratio associated with the use of cimetidine was 1.2 (P = 0.33), with a one-sided upper 95% confidence limit of 2.6 for all patients over 20 years of age, and 0.6 (P = 0.30) with a one-sided upper 95% confidence limit of 3.1 for validated cases over 12 years of age. Neither a dose-response relationship was evident (P = 0.899 and P = 0.716, respectively, when excluding the nonusers, or P = 0.245 and P = 0.215, respectively, when including the nonusers). From these data, one can exclude the occurrence of hospitalization with neutropenia or agranulocytosis due to cimetidine occurring more often than once in every 116,000 patients and once in every 573,000 patients receiving a 6-week course of the drug, respectively.",

We have previously reported the cases of patients managed with a policy of observation only. We now present the salvage rate for the patients in that study who experienced relapse. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred ninety-four patients with stage I EOC presenting between 1980 and 1994 received no adjuvant chemotherapy, but were treated with platinum-based chemotherapy at relapse. We calculated the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for the whole cohort and the salvage rate for those who experienced relapse. We defined salvage as freedom from relapse for 5 years after platinum treatment. RESULTS: Sixty-one (31%) of 194 patients experienced relapse, and 55 received platinum-based chemotherapy. Twenty-four percent were progression-free at 5 years after this treatment. Clear-cell histology and cyst rupture before the patients' original surgery were independent prognostic factors for PFS after salvage chemotherapy. The OS for all 194 patients is 72% at 10 years (median follow-up, 8.7 years), with an 80% disease-specific survival (DSS).",

Moreover, these guidelines suggest that a threshold intensity may exist, below which no improvement in peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) occurs. The purpose, therefore, was to translate the intensity of aerobic exercise in previous training studies using cardiac patients into %VO2R units, and determine whether a threshold intensity exists. METHODS: Twenty-three studies, using 28 groups of aerobically trained cardiac patients, were identified in which VO2peak was measured before and after training by gas exchange. Intensity of exercise was variously described as a percentage of VO2peak, percentage of peak heart rate (HRpeak), percentage of heart rate reserve (HRR), or percentage of peak workload. These intensities were translated into equivalent units of %VO2R. RESULTS: Of the 28 groups of patients, three failed to show significant improvements in VO2peak. These groups exercised at intensities corresponding to 47-55% of VO2R. However, six other groups exercised at comparable intensities (i.e., 42% to 55% of VO2R) and experienced significant increases in VO2peak. Other confounding variables in these studies were similar, including the initial VO2peak of the subjects, suggesting that the failure of three groups to significantly improve aerobic capacity was due to their small sample size.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Since its 1999 emergence in New York City, West Nile virus (WNV) has become the most important and widespread cause of mosquito-transmitted disease in North America. Its sweeping spread from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast was accompanied by widespread mortality among wild birds, especially corvids. Only sporadic avian mortality had previously been associated with this infection in the Old World. Here, we examine the possibility that reservoir host mortality may intensify transmission, both by concentrating vector mosquitoes on remaining hosts and by preventing the accumulation of \"herd immunity\". RESULTS: Inspection of the Ross-Macdonald expression of the basic reproductive number (R0) suggests that this quantity may increase with reservoir host mortality. Computer simulation confirms this finding and indicates that the level of virulence is positively associated with the numbers of infectious mosquitoes by the end of the epizootic. The presence of reservoir incompetent hosts in even moderate numbers largely eliminated the transmission-enhancing effect of host mortality. Local host die-off may prevent mosquitoes to \"waste\" infectious blood meals on immune host and may thus facilitate perpetuation and spread of transmission.",

Despite promising clinical interventions, most socially anxious adolescents remain untreated. To address this clinical neglect, we developed a school-based, 12-week group intervention for youth with SAD, Skills for Academic and Social Success (SASS). When implemented by psychologists, SASS has been found effective. To promote dissemination and optimize treatment access, we tested whether school counselors could be effective treatment providers. METHOD: We randomized 138, ninth through 11th graders with SAD to one of three conditions: (a) SASS delivered by school counselors (C-SASS), (b) SASS delivered by psychologists (P-SASS), or (c) a control condition, Skills for Life (SFL), a nonspecific counseling program. Blind, independent, evaluations were conducted with parents and adolescents at baseline, post-intervention, and 5\u00a0months beyond treatment completion. We hypothesized that C-SASS and P-SASS would be superior to the control, immediately after treatment and at follow-up. No prediction was made about the relative efficacy of C-SASS and P-SASS.

In the last few years, however, there has been an increasing awareness about the role of quality of life. DESIGN: This paper seeks to discuss these two important end points and their relationship in colorectal, gastric, pancreatic and liver cancers. RESULTS: Chemotherapy has doubled survival in comparison with best supportive care in gastrointestinal tumors. A subjective response, represented by a decrease in cancer-related symptoms is expected in about half of the symptomatic patients in colorectal and gastric cancer. In pancreatic cancer, the positive results in terms of clinical benefit helped define the role of chemotherapy. Although clinical benefit does not represent a validated tool to measure quality of life, it can be a first step in the definition of new, simpler tools to assess this end point. The frequent presence of a serious concomitant disease, liver cirrhosis, in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) usually prevents the use of chemotherapy in these tumors, which are often treated with locoregional treatments. Unfortunately, their impact on the survival and quality of life of these patients has never been adequately assessed.",

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify the characteristics of cellulite in women of different age and to appreciate whether cellulite could interfere with skin ageing or not. METHODS: 94 Healthy females, divided into three age groups (21-30yrs; 31-40yrs; 51-60yrs) and two grade groups of cellulite (grade 2; grade 0 or control group), were investigated using non invasive techniques. The \"orange peel appearance\" was quantified by measuring the shadowed surfaces under low angle light. The biomechanichal properties were measured (extensibility-retractability-elasticity). The thicknesses of the skin structures were also evaluated using ultrasound. Echogenicity of the dermis was recorded and dermis density determined in two bands (superficial and low dermis). RESULTS: In grade 2, the shadowed surfaces are significantly different according to age; i.e. smaller and more numerous after age of 30; the total skin thickness including hypodermis is increased of about 30% irrespective to age, compared to control group. The biomechanical properties of the skin are significantly modified as age increases without any grade effect. In grade 2, retractability and elasticity parameters are altered from age 30 whilst only from age 50 in the control group. Echogenicities of the superficial and deep dermis also decrease from age 30 and become significantly lower than the ones of grade 0.",
        "output": "Yes, there appears to be an interaction between cellulite and skin ageing, as cellulite is more noticeable and pronounced with increasing age. Cellulite is characterized by a decrease in skin thickness, increased retractability and elasticity, and decreased echogenicity of the superficial and deep dermis. All of these changes are more pronounced with increasing age, and are more severe in those with cellulite compared to those without cellulite."

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the hypothesis that alterations in heart rate variability, peak systolic velocity variability and time-averaged velocity variability in the human umbilical artery may predict early signs of dysfunctional fetal-placental coupling in pregnancies that later develop pregnancy-induced hypertension. METHODS: Doppler flow velocity recordings from the umbilical artery were performed at 10-20 weeks of gestation in 12 nulliparous women who subsequently developed pregnancy-induced hypertension. From umbilical artery velocity waveforms of at least 12 s in duration we determined absolute values and beat-to-beat variability in fetal heart rate, peak systolic and time-averaged velocity and compared these findings with those in normal nulliparous pregnant women matched for gestational age. RESULTS: Absolute values for fetal heart rate, peak systolic and time-averaged velocity as well as beat-to-beat variability in fetal heart rate did not differ significantly between women later developing pregnancy-induced hypertension and normal controls. However, variability in peak systolic velocity and time-averaged velocity were decreased in women who subsequently developed pregnancy-induced hypertension.",

        "input": "OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that manual workers are at higher risk of death than are non-manual employees when living in municipalities with higher income inequality. DESIGN: Hierarchical regression was used for the analysis were individuals were nested within municipalities according to the 1990 Swedish census. The outcome was all-cause mortality 1992-1998. The income measure at the individual level was disposable family income weighted against composition of family; the income inequality measure used at the municipality level was the Gini coefficient. PARTICIPANTS: The study population consisted of 1 578 186 people aged 40-64 years in the 1990 Swedish census, who were being reported as unskilled or skilled manual workers, lower-, intermediate-, or high-level non-manual employees. RESULTS: There was no significant association between income inequality at the municipality level and risk of death, but an expected gradient with unskilled manual workers having the highest risk and high-level non-manual employees having the lowest. However, in the interaction models the relative risk (RR) of death for high-level non-manual employees was decreasing with increasing income inequality (RR = 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63-0.93), whereas the corresponding risk for unskilled manual workers increased with increasing income inequality (RR = 1.24; 95% CI, 1.06-1.46).

The velocity of a 500 microm TiO2-microsphere as inert marker, which is placed on the mucosa region of interest, is measured by a vector-analytic calculation in mm/min. RESULTS: : We validated this technique in 20 subjects with measurements on the floor of the nose. The inter-individual variance and variable transport speed at different locations as known from the literature could be confirmed.",

However, it is unknown whether changes in Framingham risk score variables over time explain the association between SES and coronary heart disease. We examined this question given its relevance to risk assessment in clinical decision making. METHODS: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study data (initiated in 1987 with 10-years follow-up of 15,495 adults aged 45-64 years in four Southern and Mid-Western communities) were used. SES was assessed at baseline, dichotomized as low SES (defined as low education and/or low income) or not. The time dependent variables - smoking, total and high density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and use of blood pressure lowering medication - were assessed every three years. Ten-year incidence of coronary heart disease was based on EKG and cardiac enzyme criteria, or adjudicated death certificate data. Cox survival analyses examined the contribution of SES to heart disease risk independent of baseline Framingham risk score, without and with further adjustment for the time dependent variables. RESULTS: Adjusting for baseline Framingham risk score, low SES was associated with an increased coronary heart disease risk (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.53; 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 1.27 to 1.85). After further adjustment for the time dependent variables, the SES effect remained significant (HR = 1.44; 95% CI, 1.19 to 1.74).",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: The use of dispersants can be an effective way to deal with acute oil spills to limit environmental damage, however very little is known about whether chemically dispersed oil have the same toxic effect on marine organisms as mechanically dispersed oil. We exposed Atlantic cod larvae to chemically and mechanically dispersed oil for four days during the first-feeding stage of development, and collected larvae at 14 days post hatch for transcriptional analysis. A genome-wide microarray was used to screen for effects and to assess whether molecular responses to chemically and mechanically dispersed oil were similar, given the same exposure to oil (droplet distribution and concentration) with and without the addition of a chemical dispersant (Dasic NS). RESULTS: Mechanically dispersed oil induced expression changes in almost three times as many transcripts compared to chemically dispersed oil (fold change>+/-1.5). Functional analyses suggest that chemically dispersed oil affects partly different pathways than mechanically dispersed oil. By comparing the alteration in gene transcription in cod larvae exposed to the highest concentrations of either chemically or mechanically dispersed oil directly, the chemically dispersed oil affected transcription of genes involved nucleosome regulation, i.e. genes encoding proteins participating in DNA replication and chromatin formation and regulation of cell proliferation, whereas the mechanically dispersed oil most strongly affected genes encoding proteins involved in proteasome-mediated protein degradation. Cyp1a was the transcript that was most strongly affected in both exposure groups, with a 60-fold induction in the two high-exposure groups according to the RT-qPCR data, but no significant difference in transcriptional levels was observed between the two treatments.",

If this mechanism is important, the association of maternal body mass index (BMI) with offspring BMI should be stronger than the association of paternal with offspring BMI. OBJECTIVE: To compare the relative strengths of association of maternal and paternal BMI with offspring BMI at age 7.5, taking into account the possible effect of non-paternity. METHODS: We compared strength of association for maternal-offspring and paternal-offspring BMI for 4654 complete parent-offspring trios in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), using unstandardised and standardised regression analysis. We carried out a sensitivity analysis to investigate the influence of non-paternity on these associations. RESULTS: The strength of association between parental BMI and offspring BMI at age 7.5 was similar for both parents. Taking into account correlations between maternal and paternal BMI, performing standardised rather than unstandardised regression and carrying out a sensitivity analysis for non-paternity emphasised the robustness of the general similarity of the associations. The associations between high parental BMI (top decile) and offspring BMI are also similar for both parents.",

Previous clinical studies have suggested accelerated vascularisation; with a reduction in the duration of the 1st stage after the application of Integra, from 2 to 4 weeks to as little as 4 days, but with no histological evidence. However, histological studies, without TNP, have shown that vascularisation occurs between the second and the fourth week. This study set out to examine histologically the rate of DRT neovascularisation when combined with TNP. METHODS: Eight patients with nine reconstruction sites were enlisted. Unmeshed Integra and fibrin sealant to promote adherence were used. TNP was applied for the duration between the 1st and the 2nd stages. Patients underwent serial biopsies on days 7, 14, 21 and 28 post-application. The biopsies were stained with H&E and endothelial markers CD31 and CD34. Template vascularisation was assessed as a percentage of the template depth in which patent, canalised vascular channels could be demonstrated.

Reasons for visits were categorized by acuity level: potentially preventable visits were defined as visits related to ambulatory sensitive conditions; low acuity and high acuity visits were defined by the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale. RESULTS: The total number of ED visits for the 6-year period is 4403 (n=1217). Of these visits, 752 (17%) were classified as potentially preventable, 1443 (33%) as low acuity and 2208 (50%) as high acuity. The majority of patients, regardless of acuity level, did not see a primary care practitioner on the day of the ED visit and most visits occurred during the weekday (Mon-Fri 0700-1659 hours). ED use was highest in the first year but remained high over the subsequent years. For potentially preventable visits, the majority of visits were related to urinary tract infections (n=385 visits, 51.2%), followed by pneumonia (n=91, 12.1%).",
        "output": "No, the emergency department is not an appropriate substitute for primary care for persons with traumatic spinal cord injury. Persons with TSCI should have ongoing access to primary care for preventive care, management of chronic conditions, and urgent care needs."

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Congenital thoracic scoliosis is associated with diminished pulmonary function. Early posterior thoracic spinal fusion surgery may additionally impact pulmonary function beyond the natural history of the disease by further inhibiting thoracic growth. The primary study aim is to determine if early thoracic spine fusion patients have diminished pulmonary function versus untreated patients at a similar age. The secondary study aim is to determine how plain radiographic measurements of thoracic deformity change over time and correlate to pulmonary function in these patients. METHODS: Sequential spinal radiographs and one-time pulmonary function tests were performed in 43 consecutive congenital thoracic scoliosis patients with either a history of early posterior thoracic fusion or no surgery. Multiple stepwise t testing compared the patient-related and radiographic variables in the early surgery and no surgery groups. Multiple stepwise linear regression analysis examined the effect of the variables at final follow-up on forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume. RESULTS: All patients exhibited decreased forced vital capacity, but there was no difference between early surgery and no surgery groups at an average follow-up age of 10.5 years. A mid- (versus low) thoracic apex, decreased space available for the lung, and decreased age-corrected thoracic width correlated with decreased forced vital capacity. Between initial and final radiographic follow-up, the rate of change in thoracic height and width was decreased in the early surgery versus no surgery group.",

We also compared values obtained in cervical and vaginal secretions. METHODS: In a population of women with normal singleton pregnancies between 22 and 28 weeks gestation, we have performed (cervical and vaginal) quantitative fetal fibronectin tests in two separate groups classified according to timing after coitus (one group of women had intercourse within 24 h before sampling and the control group had intercourse>24 h before sampling). The main outcome measures were the proportion of positive tests in both groups and the correlation between cervical and vaginal values through the Pearson correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Both groups were similar in terms of general characteristics and pregnancy outcomes. The proportions of positive results in the vaginal secretions were 7.5% and 25.0% (P=0.007) in the control and coitus group, respectively. In the cervical secretions, the proportions of positive tests were greater, but not statistically different (39.7% and 40.0%, respectively). The Pearson correlation coefficients were very low (<0.3) indicating poor correlation between both sampling locations. Even if the cervical values were generally greater than the vaginal values, they were lower in 26% of the women.",

We evaluated the outcome and angiographic findings of eyes that underwent the implantation of scleral fixated IOLs. METHODS: Iris and retinal fluorescein angiography were performed in 13 eyes that had received posterior chamber IOL implantation with scleral fixation. Follow-up examinations also assessed visual acuity (VA), intraocular pressure (IOP), IOL decentration and complications related to the procedure. RESULTS: Mean visual acuity was 0.29 preoperatively and 0.71 postoperatively after a mean follow-up of 14.2 months. A best corrected visual acuity of 0.5 or better was obtained in 12 eyes. Iris fluorescein angiography did not show major vascular abnormalities. Retinal angiography showed 5 cases of macular edema. In 6 eyes light-induced retinal lesions occurred. Cellophane maculopathy was disclosed in 4 eyes. Macular edema was associated with photic injury in 4 cases and with cellophane maculopathy in 2 cases. Mean postoperative visual acuity was 0.6 in eyes with macular edema and 0.88 in eyes without (SD 0.18; range 0.5-1.0).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using a retrospective cohort study design, the investigators enrolled postsurgical patients treated for tongue carcinomas in Hokkaido University Hospital. The primary outcome variable was oropharyngeal swallow efficiency (OPSE) determined by videofluoroscopic evaluation, and OPSE at follow-up was compared with that at discharge. Other variables included current nutritional status (body mass index, serum albumin), dietary intake, self-rating of current swallowing function, and occurrence of pneumonia. Statistical analysis used the paired t test and the Spearman rank correlation. RESULTS: Swallowing function was assessed in 20 patients (11 men and 9 women) who underwent the surgical treatment of tongue carcinomas; the median age was 70 years (range, 56 to 90 yrs). The mean OPSE values for liquid and paste at follow-up were 26.6 \u00b1 21.2 and 21.9 \u00b1 22.5, respectively. The mean values for the body mass index and serum albumin at presentation were 22.2 \u00b1 3.4 kg/m(2) and 4.5 \u00b1 0.3 g/dL, respectively.

The question arises as to who might be better equipped currently to provide services to multilingual populations: SLTs with more clinical experience in such contexts, or recently trained SLTs who are themselves linguistically and culturally diverse and whose training programmes deliberately focused on multilingualism and multiculturalism? AIMS: To investigate whether length of clinical experience influenced: number of bilingual children treated, languages spoken by these children, languages in which assessment and remediation can be offered, assessment instrument(s) favoured, and languages in which therapy material is required. METHOD: From questionnaires completed by 243 Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA)-registered SLTs who treat children with language problems, two groups were drawn:71 more experienced (ME) respondents (20+ years of experience) and 79 less experienced (LE) respondents (maximum 5 years of experience). RESULTS: The groups did not differ significantly with regard to (1) number of children(monolingual or bilingual) with language difficulties seen, (2) number of respondents seeing child clients who have Afrikaans or an African language as home language, (3) number of respondents who can offer intervention in Afrikaans or English and (4) number of respondents who reported needing therapy material in Afrikaans or English. However, significantly more ME than LE respondents reported seeing first language child speakers of English, whereas significantly more LE than ME respondents could provide services, and required therapy material, in African languages.",

RESULTS: A total of 16 of 28 studies included risk factors in their ischemic stroke subtype definitions. Hypertension and diabetes appeared commoner among patients with lacunar versus nonlacunar infarction. However, analyses confined to studies using risk factor-free ischemic subtype definitions found only a marginal excess of hypertension with lacunar versus nonlacunar infarction (RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.19) and no difference for diabetes (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.09).

They provide enzymes and drugs and serve as experimental organisms. In 1991, a landmark paper estimated that there are 1.5 million fungi on the Earth. Because only 70000 fungi had been described at that time, the estimate has been the impetus to search for previously unknown fungi. Fungal habitats include soil, water, and organisms that may harbor large numbers of understudied fungi, estimated to outnumber plants by at least 6 to 1. More recent estimates based on high-throughput sequencing methods suggest that as many as 5.1 million fungal species exist. METHODS: Technological advances make it possible to apply molecular methods to develop a stable classification and to discover and identify fungal taxa. KEY RESULTS: Molecular methods have dramatically increased our knowledge of Fungi in less than 20 years, revealing a monophyletic kingdom and increased diversity among early-diverging lineages.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Among people with idiopathic environmental intolerance attributed to electromagnetic fields (IEI-EMF), a better than random detection ability for a 50-Hz 0.5-mT magnetic field (MF) and a propensity to experience more symptoms than controls was reported in a previous study. PURPOSE: The current study aimed to replicate and clarify these results using a modified experimental design. METHOD: Participants of the provocation experiment were 49 individuals with self-reported IEI-EMF and 57 controls. They completed the questionnaires (symptom expectations, Somatosensory Amplification Scale--SSAS, radiation subscale of the Modern Health Worries Scale--MHWS Radiation) and attempted to detect the presence of the MF directed to their right arm in 20 subsequent 1-min sessions. Symptom reports were registered after each session. RESULTS: Individuals with IEI-EMF as opposed to the control group showed a higher than random detection performance (d' index of signal detection theory), while no difference in their bias (\u03b2 index) toward the presence of the MF was found. Predictors of reported symptoms were self-reported IEI-EMF and believed as opposed to actual presence of the MF. People with IEI-EMF reported significantly more symptoms particularly in the believed presence of the MF. IEI-EMF was closely related to MHWS Radiation and SSAS scores.",
        "output": "Yes, there is a connection between electrosensitivity and electrosensibility. People who are electrosensitive are more likely to report symptoms when exposed to electromagnetic fields, such as those generated by electric appliances and power lines. This is due to their heightened ability to detect the presence of these fields, as well as their increased bias towards believing that they are being exposed to the fields."

DESIGN: The study was a nationwide questionnaire survey of a birth cohort. SUBJECTS: All deliveries greater than 500g weight of singleton live births and stillbirths occurring throughout Greece during April 1983 were included. Completed questionnaires were returned for 10,953 deliveries (8% of total annual registered births in Greece), and data on 10,790 singleton births were analysed, including 127 stillbirths and 137 early neonatal deaths. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The questionnaires contained information on demographic characteristics of each parent, mother's reproductive history, and clinical course of pregnancy, labour and perinatal period. Mothers living in big urban centres were compared with the rest of the country. Overall mortality rates were similar but births in the big urban centres were of significantly lower weight due to fetal growth retardation. Logistic regression analysis, taking account of birthweight, parity, maternal age, and maternal education showed that there was an advantage to mothers living in big urban centres, perinatal mortality being 63% higher in the rest of the country (chi 2 = 7.4, p less than 0.01).",

Such distinctions call for clarification of whether psychological well-being and ill-being comprise opposite ends of a bipolar continuum, or are best construed as separate, independent dimensions of mental health. Biology can help resolve this query--bipolarity predicts 'mirrored' biological correlates (i.e. well-being and ill-being correlate similarly with biomarkers, but show opposite directional signs), whereas independence predicts 'distinct' biological correlates (i.e. well-being and ill-being have different biological signatures). METHODS: Multiple aspects of psychological well-being (eudaimonic, hedonic) and ill-being (depression, anxiety, anger) were assessed in a sample of aging women (n = 135, mean age = 74) on whom diverse neuroendocrine (salivary cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, DHEA-S) and cardiovascular factors (weight, waist-hip ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, HDL cholesterol, total/HDL cholesterol, glycosylated hemoglobin) were also measured. RESULTS: Measures of psychological well-being and ill-being were significantly linked with numerous biomarkers, with some associations being more strongly evident for respondents aged 75+. Outcomes for seven biomarkers supported the distinct hypothesis, while findings for only two biomarkers supported the mirrored hypothesis.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Levels of the pro-tumorigenic prostaglandin PGE(2) are increased in colorectal cancer, previously attributed to increased synthesis through COX-2 upregulation and, more recently, to decreased catabolism. The functionally linked genes 15-prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) and the prostaglandin transporter PGT co-operate in prostaglandin degradation and are downregulated in colorectal cancer. We previously reported repression of 15-PGDH expression by the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, commonly deregulated during early colorectal neoplasia. Here we asked whether \u03b2-catenin also regulates PGT expression. METHODS: The effect of \u03b2-catenin deletion in vivo was addressed by PGT immunostaining of \u03b2-catenin(-/lox)-villin-cre-ERT2 mouse tissue. The effect of siRNA-mediated \u03b2-catenin knockdown and dnTCF4 induction in vitro was addressed by semi-quantitative and quantitative real-time RT-PCR and immunoblotting. RESULTS: This study shows for the first time that deletion of \u03b2-catenin in murine intestinal epithelium in vivo upregulates PGT protein, especially in the crypt epithelium. Furthermore, \u03b2-catenin knockdown in vitro increases PGT expression in both colorectal adenoma- and carcinoma-derived cell lines, as does dnTCF4 induction in LS174T cells.",

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a nonconcurrent cohort study of gestational diabetics identified by universal screening and delivered from Jan. 1, 1990, to Dec. 31, 1992. Multiple gestations and patients with chronic medical conditions were excluded. The following risk factors for gestational diabetes mellitus were abstracted: obesity (>80 kg), family history of diabetes, previous gestational diabetes mellitus, and previous macrosomic, stillborn, or anomalous fetus. Patients with one or more risk factors were compared with those without risk factors. A group of low-risk nondiabetic patients served as controls. The incidences of A2 diabetes mellitus, cesarean section, neonatal macrosomia, and shoulder dystocia were the outcome variables of interest. RESULTS: Selective screening would have failed to detect 43% of gestational diabetics. Twenty-eight percent of the missed gestational diabetics would have required insulin (class A2). When compared with controls, patients with gestational diabetes mellitus were at increased risk for macrosomia (26% vs 11%, p<0.01), cesarean section (37% vs 15%, p<0.01), and shoulder dystocia (9% vs 2%, p<0.05). Patients with and without risk factors did not differ in mean maternal age, gestational age at delivery, birth weight, incidence of requiring insulin, macrosomia, or cesarean delivery.

METHODS: Two groups were included: 20 patients underwent perfusion CT imaging, and 10 patients were scanned using a dual-energy protocol. In both groups, tissue density [Hounsfield units (HU)] was measured in the pancreatic head, body and tail. Functional data were calculated (blood flow/blood volume in the perfusion CT group, iodine concentration in the dual-energy group), and variability was assessed. RESULTS: Density measurements were comparable for the perfusion and dual-energy CT groups, and ranged from 14 to 60 HU. Maximal enhancement differences between the head/body/tail of the pancreas ranged between 2 and 21 HU. Considerable variability was observed, both in density measurements (ranging from 3 to 34%) and in functional parameters (mean variability in perfusion CT parameters blood flow and blood volume was 21.3 and 10% respectively; mean variability in dual-energy iodine-mapping results was 24.4%).",

        "input": "INTRODUCTION: Antimalarial medications are basal active drugs used for the treatment of various rheumatological conditions. Their common side-effects include eye damage.AIM: The aim of this study is to determine the safety of antimalarial medications used for rheumatological conditions and the incidence of retinopathy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty-five patients with rheumatological conditions, who were followed in our rheumatology clinics between 2005 and 2009 while under chloroquine (CQ) and/or hydroxychloroquine (HQ) treatment were included in the study. Indirect ophthalmoscopic examination with 90 dioptry lens, frontal segment examination and macular visual area test were applied to all patients. Severity of retinopathy was evaluated as mild initial defect in the macula, or severe visual area loss. RESULTS: Retinopathy findings were detected in 21 out of 85 patients (24.7%). Of these patients, 12 had mild initial defects while nine had severe visual area loss. Of 21 patients, eight were on HQ and 13 were on CQ treatment. Of the patients seen with findings of retinopathy, 17 had comorbid hypertension (HT) and six had diabetes mellitus (DM). Patients receiving CQ are under higher risk compared to those on HQ treatment (P = 0.001). Patient age, disease duration, HT and DM presence had no statistically significant effect on retinopathy development (P = 0.144, P = 0.305, P = 0.258, P = 0.395, respectively).",

METHODS: Since 2000, ibuprofen has been administered to all infants at<30 weeks of gestation who are admitted to our unit, to prevent patent ductus arteriosus. We retrospectively compared data for 418 infants subjected to ibuprofen prophylaxis (2000-2007) and 288 infants not exposed to ibuprofen (1993-1999). RESULTS: The ibuprofen group had a significantly higher peak total serum bilirubin level (9.0 +/- 2.5 mg/dL vs 7.3 +/- 3.3 mg/dL), more need for phototherapy (398 infants [95%] vs 254 infants [87.6%]), and a longer phototherapy duration (94.3 +/- 43.6 hours vs 87.2 +/- 38.6 hours). Groups did not differ with respect to gestational age, birth weight, gender ratio, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency incidence, or hypoalbuminemia (<2.5 g/dL) incidence. Hemolytic isoimmunization was diagnosed with similar incidences (no-ibuprofen group: 7 of 288 infants; ibuprofen group: 8 of 418 infants).

We reviewed our early experience and outcomes of LPD. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients undergoing LPD was compared to a matched cohort of open pancreaticoduodenectomy (OPD) patients. The endpoints are as follows: age, gender, ASA score, BMI, operative time, estimated blood loss, perioperative transfusion requirement, intensive care unit stay, margin status, lymph node count, 90\u00a0day morbidity and mortality, length of stay, and adjuvant therapy treatment. RESULTS: Fourteen patients underwent an attempted LPD. The median operative time was 456\u00a0min (interquartile range (IQR), 109.5), median estimated blood loss was 300\u00a0ml (IQR, 225), and 29% of the patients required a perioperative blood transfusion. A conversion was necessary in two patients (14%). A malignancy was present in 12 patients. The mean tumor size was 2.2\u00a0cm (standard deviation (SD), 1.1), the mean lymph node count was 18.5 (SD 6.2), and an R0 resection was achieved in all 12 cases. Clavien grade I/II complications occurred in 42% of the patients, and Clavien grade III/IV complications occurred in three (20%). There was one late postoperative death.

Based upon a clinical impression, and research showing that palpable cancers are more likely to be node positive, we hypothesized that primary breast cancers more proximal to the skin of the breast are more likely to be positive for axillary lymph node metastasis. METHODS: This is a retrospective medical record review of 209 women with stage T1 or T2 (</=5.0 cm) invasive breast cancer who received dedicated breast ultrasound at a single mammography clinic in Columbia, South Carolina, between 1997 and 2002. RESULTS: None of the 26 cancers more than 14 mm from the skin had metastasized to axillary lymph nodes. In logistic regression modeling only tumor size, histologic grade and tumor proximity to the skin (as a categorical variable) were significantly associated with odds of axillary metastasis. Among cancers within 14 mm of the skin, proximity was not an independent predictor.",

Adjustment for one or more predictors in a multivariable analysis may be considered to correct the estimate of the treatment effect for any imbalance that by chance may have occurred between the randomized groups. Moreover, adjustment results in a stratified estimate of the effect of treatment. METHODS AND RESULTS: The effects of adjustment (correction for imbalance and stratification) were studied with logistic regression analysis in the Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO)-I trial. The primary end point was 30-day death, which occurred in 6.3% of 10,348 patients randomly assigned to tissue plasminogen activator and 7.3% of 20,162 patients randomly assigned to streptokinase thrombolytic therapy. This is equivalent to an unadjusted odds ratio of 0.853. No significant imbalance had occurred for any of 17 baseline characteristics considered, including well-known demographic, presenting, and history characteristics. Adjusted for age, the odds ratio was 0.829, which is an 18% increase in estimated effect on the logistic scale. When adjusted for 17 characteristics, the odds ratio was 0.820, an increase of 25%. The increase in effect estimate was largely explained by the stratification effect and only partly by imbalance of predictors.",

The Fistula Risk Score (FRS) predicts the risk and impact of a clinically relevant (CR)-POPF and can be useful in assessing the impact of octreotide in scenarios of risk. METHODS: From 2001-2013, 1018 PDs were performed at four institutions, with octreotide administered at the surgeon's discretion. The FRS was used to analyse the occurrence and burden of POPF across various risk scenarios. RESULTS: Overall, 391 patients (38.4%) received octreotide. A CR-POPF occurred more often when octreotide was used (21.0% versus 7.0%; P<0.001), especially when there was advanced FRS risk. Octreotide administration also correlated with an increased hospital stay (mean: 13 versus 11\u2009days; P\u2009<\u20090.001).

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Although the seasonal variation and the effect of cold temperature on heart failure (HF) morbidity have been well documented, it is unknown whether the temperature variation within a day, that is, diurnal temperature range (DTR), is an independent risk factor for HF. We hypothesized that large DTR might be a source of additional environmental stress and, therefore, a risk factor for HF exacerbation. We aimed to test the association between DTR and HF hospitalization and to examine the effect modifiers, such as age, sex, and season. METHODS AND RESULTS: We collected daily meteorologic data and emergency HF hospital admissions from 2000 to 2007 in Hong Kong. We used Poisson regression models to fit the relationship between daily DTR and emergency HF hospitalizations, after adjusting for the time trend, seasonality, mean temperature, humidity, and levels of outdoor air pollution. We confirmed the seasonal variation of HF with peak hospital admissions in winter in Hong Kong. The adverse effects of DTR on emergency HF admissions were observed on the current day and lasted for the following several days. Every 1\u00b0C increase of DTR at lag0 corresponded to 0.86% (95% confidence interval, 0.31%-1.43%) increment of emergency hospital admissions for HF. DTR exhibited significantly greater effect in the cool season, and on female and elderly patients.",

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: Clinical supervision is widely recognised as a mechanism for providing professional support, professional development and clinical governance for healthcare workers. There have been limited studies about the effectiveness of clinical supervision for allied health and minimal studies conducted within the Australian health context. The aim of the present study was to identify whether clinical supervision was perceived to be effective by allied health professionals and to identify components that contributed to effectiveness. Participants completed an anonymous online questionnaire, administered through the health service's intranet. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with community allied health workers (n = 82) 8 months after implementation of structured clinical supervision. Demographic data (age, gender), work-related history (profession employment level, years of experience), and supervision practice (number and length of supervision sessions) were collected through an online survey. The outcome measure, clinical supervision effectiveness, was operationalised using the Manchester Clinical Supervision Scale-26 (MCSS-26). Data were analysed with Pearson correlation (r) and independent sample t-tests (t) with significance set at 0.05 (ie the probability of significant difference set at P<0.05). RESULTS: The length of the supervision sessions (r(s) \u2265 0.44), the number of sessions (r(s) \u2265 0.35) and the total period supervision had been received (r(s) \u2265 0.42) were all significantly positively correlated with the MCSS-26 domains of clinical supervision effectiveness. Three individual variables, namely 'receiving clinical supervision', 'having some choice in the allocation of clinical supervisor' and 'having a completed clinical supervision agreement', were also significantly associated with higher total MCSS-26 scores (P(s)<0.014).",
        "output": "Yes, clinical supervision can sustain the workforce in the current healthcare landscape. The results of this study suggest that clinical supervision is perceived to be effective by allied health professionals and that this effectiveness is associated with the length of supervision sessions, the number of supervision sessions and the presence of certain components such as receiving clinical supervision, having some choice in the allocation of clinical supervisor and having a completed clinical supervision agreement."

We are unaware of any published reports directly evaluating the safety of EDPS in older patients (\u226565 years old). Many EDPS experts consider seniors to be at higher risk. The objective was to evaluate the complication rate of EDPS in elderly adults. METHODS: This was a prospective, observational study of EDPS patients at least 65 years old, as compared with patients aged 18 to 49 and 50 to 64 years. Physicians were blind to the objectives of this research. The study protocol required an ED nurse trained in data collection to be present to record vital signs and assess for any prospectively defined complications. We used American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification for systemic disease to evaluate and account for the comorbidities of patients. We used the Fisher exact test for the difference in proportions across age groups and analysis of variance for the differences in dosing across age and ASA categories. RESULTS: During the 4-year study, we enrolled 50 patients at least 65 years old, 149 patients aged 50 to 64 years, and 665 patients aged 18 to 49 years. Adverse event rates were 8%, 5.4%, and 5.2%, respectively (P = .563). The at least 65 years age group represented a greater percentage of those with higher ASA scores (P<.001). The average total sedative dose in the at least 65 years group was significantly lower than the comparisons (P<.001).",
        "output": "The results of this study suggest that EDPS is safe for elderly patients, with an adverse event rate of 8%, which is not significantly different from the adverse event rate of 5.4% in patients aged 50 to 64 years and 5.2% in patients aged 18 to 49 years. The at least 65 years age group also had a significantly lower average total sedative dose than the other two age groups."

There is, however, evidence that drinking is protective for some health conditions. The validity of this evidence has been questioned due to residual confounding and selection bias. The aim of this study is to clarify which drinking profiles and other demographic characteristics are associated with poor self-rated health among a community-based sample of older adults in England. The study also examines whether drinking designated as being \"increasing-risk\" or \"higher-risk\" is associated with poorer self-rated health. METHOD: This study used data from Wave 0, Wave 1 and Wave 5 of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing [ELSA]. Logistic regression analysis, was used to examine the association between drinking profiles (based on quantity and frequency of drinking) and self-rated health, adjusting for gender, age, wealth, social class, education, household composition, smoking and body mass index [BMI]. RESULTS: Twenty percent of the sample reported drinking above the recommended level at wave 0. Rates of poor self-rated health were highest among those who had stopped drinking, followed by those who never drank. The rates of poor self-rated health among non-drinkers were significantly higher than the rates of poor self-rated health for any of the groups who reported alcohol consumption. In the adjusted logistic regression models there were no drinking profiles associated with significantly higher rates of poor self-rated health relative to occasional drinkers.",

METHODS: The sample consisted of 165 primary school students (10-12 years old). Participants completed measures of emotional distress, exercise habit strength, and the Digit Span Test. Mid-year exam results were used as an indicator of academic performance. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to analyse the data. RESULTS: The results of SEM revealed an acceptable fit for the hypothesised model. Exercise habit was positively associated with short-term memory, and better short-term memory was associated with better academic performance. However, although an inverse relationship was found between emotional distress and short-term memory, a positive association was found between exercise habit strength and emotional distress.",
        "output": "The results of the structural equation modelling (SEM) suggest that exercise habit strength moderates the relationship between emotional distress and short-term memory in Malaysian primary school children. Specifically, exercise habit strength appears to act as a buffer, reducing the negative impact of emotional distress on short-term memory.

There is still controversy whether or not, the absence of cardiopulmonary bypass results in a lower incidence of AF. METHODS: Six hundred and seventy patients that underwent revascularization by using in situ LIMA for single vessel disease were included in this retrospective study and the patients were divided in two groups. Group I included 328 patients who underwent complete revascularization with cardiopulmonary bypass and group II consisted of 342 patients who underwent complete revascularization without cardiopulmonary bypass. Then, the incidence and predictive perioperative factors of AF in two groups were determined and compared with each other. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between two groups with respect to the preoperative demographic characteristics of the patients. The incidence of postoperative AF was determined as 16.1% after on-pump and 14.6% after off-pump revascularization. Avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass did not decrease the incidence of postoperative AF. Sex, age over 65 years, prophylactic beta-blocker usage and left ventricular dysfunction were independent predictive factors in group I (r2=0.51; P<0.001). However, only age over 65 years and prophylactic beta-blocker usage were independent predictive factors in group II (r2=0.59; P<0.01).

        "input": "BACKGROUND: A distal femur nail with fixed-angle locking screws intends to combine the advantages of angular stability and intramedullary stabilization in extraarticular distal femur fractures. The goal of this study was to analyze whether the locked compression distal femur nail (LCN) was biomechanically more stable than a conventional standard distal femur nail (CN). METHODS: Both nails were compared on a series of 10 matched pairs of human femora. After setting a distal femur defect fracture, the intramedullary stabilized femur was axially loaded starting from 100 N, increasing in steps of 100 N after every 200 cycles with a triangular frequency of 1 Hz, until a predefined point of failure was reached. RESULTS: The two types of nails showed no significant difference in terms of maximum tolerated load, maximum number of cycles repeated, or axial deformation of the bone-implant construct. The mean load at failure was 2,954 N for the CN and 2,483 N for the LCN. The mean axial deformation for the conventional (14.8 mm) and locked compression nail (15.3 mm) did not differ significantly. Mode of failure was a bony fracture in all specimens predominantly involving the proximal femur.",

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 550 patients aged over 16 years seen in our center over a period of four years who had injuries in at least two organ systems. The ISS, NISS and TRISS were calculated for each patient. TRISS was calculated in two ways: TRISS 1 with age, Revised Trauma Score (RTS) and ISS, and TRISS 2 with age, RTS and NISS. The cut-off values for TRISS 1, TRISS 2, ISS and NISS were determined by ROC analysis. RESULTS: The ideal cut-off values for the prediction of mortality were 21.0 (AUC: 0.907) for ISS and 25.0 (AUC: 0.914) for NISS. There was no statistically significant difference between the ROC curves of ISS and NISS. The ideal cut-off values for predicting mortality were 90 (AUC: 0.934) for TRISS 1 and 86 (AUC: 0.935) for TRISS 2. There was no statistically significant difference between the ROC curves of TRISS 1 and TRISS 2.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1997 and 2003, 43 men with complex stricture disease underwent pendulous urethral reconstruction by a single surgeon (AFM). In 18 consecutive cases with a mean stricture length of 7.24 cm from 2000 to 2003 fibrin sealant was applied over a ventral onlay anastomosis performed with running 5-zero polydiaxanone suture. Results were compared with those in 25 men who underwent the procedure without fibrin sealant from 1997 to 2000, who served as a control group (mean stricture length 8.30 cm, p = 0.418). Catheter duration was recorded after anastomosis integrity was radiographically confirmed. RESULTS: All 18 patients with sealant were completely healed within 14 days, which was significantly shorter than in controls (p<0.001). In the sealant group increased stricture length was associated with longer catheter time (p = 0.677).

Little is known, however, about whether patient reports are useful for measuring patient safety. OBJECTIVES: To examine the degree to which physician reviewers agreed that patient reports of \"negative effects\" constituted AEs, and to identify questionnaire items that affected reviewers' judgments. METHODS: We surveyed patients discharged from Massachusetts hospitals in 2003 to elicit information about negative effects associated with hospitalization. Physician reviewers judged whether patient-reported negative effects represented AEs, and classified the severity of the event. Likelihood ratios were calculated to assess whether patient responses to questionnaire items affected reviewers' judgments. RESULTS: Of the 2582 patients surveyed, 753 patients reported 1170 negative effects, and 71.2% of these effects were classified as AEs by physician reviewers. Negative effects most likely to be classified as AEs involved newly prescribed medications and changes to previously prescribed medications. Additional information elicited from follow-up survey questions modestly affected reviewers' classification of serious AEs. Negative effects reported by women, younger patients, those reporting better health status, and those not admitted through the emergency department were more likely to be classified as AEs.",
        "output": "Yes, patients can report adverse events that may not be captured by traditional methods such as chart reviews.

The aim of this study was to explore how physician Fellows of the RACP relate to and use the ethical Guidelines of the RACP regarding relationships with the pharmaceutical industry. METHODS: Focus group discussions and in-depth face-to-face interviews were used to gather information from physicians who responded to invitations placed in electronic newsletters or through word of mouth. RESULTS: Five focus groups and eight in-depth interviews were conducted with 56 practising physicians in Australia and New Zealand. Most physicians were aware of the RACP ethical Guidelines (3rd edition, 2006), but only a few used them to resolve ethical dilemmas or to influence their decision-making in relation to interacting with the pharmaceutical industry. Ethical standards used or approaches to decision-making practices related to interactions with the pharmaceutical industry were most likely to have been developed through past experiences, peer pressure or decisions that were considered to be 'in the best interests of their patients'. There were strong opinions expressed about relationships with the pharmaceutical industry and how these relationships often lead to feelings of humiliation. Some felt they were prostituting themselves for the sake of acquiring funding for staff positions, medical devices, research or attendance at conferences. Very few physicians recollected having any assistance on how to deal with the pharmaceutical industry during their training, and those few who did recollect such input through their curricula and education felt they did not benefit.",

METHODS: From a cohort of 481 FGR cases delivered at>or = 34 weeks, demographic and obstetric variables, fetal biometry and Doppler indices of the uterine, umbilical and fetal middle cerebral arteries available within 2 weeks of delivery, were related to adverse neonatal outcome, defined as admission to the neonatal intensive care unit for indications other than low birth weight alone. RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis showed that gestational age (GA) at delivery (odds ratio (OR) = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.50-0.70), abdominal circumference (AC) centile (OR = 0.69; 95% CI, 0.59-0.81) and umbilical artery (UA) pulsatility index (PI) centile (OR = 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04) significantly correlated with adverse neonatal outcome. From this model we calculated a score of adverse neonatal outcome expressed by the formula: (UA-PI centile/3) - (10 x AC centile) + (10 x (40 - GA at delivery in weeks)). Receiver-operating characteristics curve analysis demonstrated that a score of>or = 25 optimally predicted adverse neonatal outcome (sensitivity of 75%, false-positive rate of 18%).

Accounting for accommodative responses from a human factors perspective may be motivated by the interest of designing virtual image displays or by establishing an autonomic indicator that allows for remote measurement at the human eye. Heart period, pulse transit time, and the pupillary response were considered as reference for possible closed-loop accommodative effects. Cognitive demand was varied by presenting monocularly numbers at a viewing distance of 5 D (20 cm) which had to be read, added or multiplied; further, letters were presented in a \"n-back\" task. RESULTS: Cardiovascular parameters and pupil size indicated a change in autonomic balance, while error rates and reaction time confirmed the increased cognitive demand during task processing. An observed decrease in accommodation could not be attributed to the cognitive demand itself for two reasons: (1) the cognitive demand induced a shift in gaze direction which, for methodological reasons, accounted for a substantial part of the observed accommodative changes. (2) Remaining effects disappeared when the correctness of task processing was taken into account.",

Underlying mechanisms are not understood, but vascular shunting away from the gut could be responsible. Therefore, blood flow in the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and hepatic portal vein (HPV) was examined at sea level (SL) and after ascent to 4392 m (HA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve subjects [eight male, mean age 40 (22-72) years] were studied following an overnight fast and a standard meal. Cross-sectional vessel area and blood velocity were measured by ultrasound, systolic and diastolic flow calculated for the SMA (HR x vessel area x velocity, cm(3) min(-1)) and mean flow for the HPV. RESULTS: All subjects experienced reduced appetite at HA. Blood flow in the SMA and HPV increased following food at SL (mean SMA systolic flow 1024 vs. 3316 cm(3) min(-1), P<0.001; HPV 505 vs. 1789, P<0.001) and at HA (2020 vs. 3767, P<0.001; HPV 708 vs. 1727, P<0.001). Pre-prandial flow in the SMA and HPV was significantly increased at HA compared with SL. The changes were due to increased vessel diameter and increased flow velocity. There was no difference in post-prandial flow between SL and HA in the HPV, although the increase in post-prandial flow was greater at SL than HA (254% increase vs. 144%).",
        "output": "Yes, changes in gastro-intestinal blood flow may explain high-altitude anorexia. The increased blood flow in the superior mesenteric artery and hepatic portal vein observed at high altitude may be responsible for the increased vascular shunting away from the gut, which is thought to be responsible for the decreased appetite experienced at high altitude. Additionally, the increased post-prandial flow at high altitude may contribute to the decreased appetite, as the increased flow velocity and vessel diameter may increase the amount of blood shunting away from the gut."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 264 patients treated for breast cancer who had undergone mammography, ultrasonography, and MRI. We compared the size of the tumor on the three techniques and the sensitivity of the techniques for detecting additional lesions both in the overall group and in subgroups of patients classified according to their breast density, age, menopausal status, and histological findings of intraductal carcinoma. The definitive histological diagnosis was used as the gold standard. RESULTS: MRI was the technique that was most concordant with the histological findings for the size of the lesion, and it was also the technique that detected the most additional lesions. With MRI, we observed no differences in lesion size between the overall group and the subgroups in which MRI provided added value. Likewise, we observed no differences in the number of additional lesions detected in the overall group except for multicentric lesions, which was larger in older patients (P=.02). In the subgroup of patients in which MRI provided added value, the sensitivity for bilateral lesions was higher in patients with fatty breasts (P=.04).

Nevertheless, some urologists avoid closed suction drains after partial nephrectomy mainly because of a theoretical increased risk of a prolonged urinary leak or delayed hemorrhage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the records of 184 patients who underwent 197 consecutive partial nephrectomies at our institution. Closed suction or open passive (Penrose) drainage was used based on surgeon preference. Drain type was compared with duration of use and the incidence of relevant complications. RESULTS: A Penrose drain was used in 37.6% (74 of 197) of partial nephrectomies and a closed suction drain was used in 62.4% (123). Clinical characteristics were equivalent between both groups, including age, body mass index, tumor size (mean 3.1 cm), number of renal tumors excised, estimated blood loss and operative time. There was no statistically significant difference in the duration of drainage between the Penrose group (mean 7.1 days) and the closed suction group (7.8 days).

The recording of an AP potential is an excellent guide for selection of ablation site. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the pathway potential is always a fast potential. METHODS: Ten patients (six females, mean age, 30 +/- 12 years) with preexcited tachycardias involving a Mahaim pathway underwent electrophysiological study and subsequent attempts at RF ablation. Mahaim potentials (M-potential) recorded at the site of successful ablation were reviewed and classified by at least two reviewers. RESULTS: In all patients, Mahaim pathways were characterized as atriofascicular types. The M-potential was fast in seven patients (group one), and slow in the remaining patients (group two). All group two patients had a history of prior failed ablation. Atrial electrograms were recorded closer to the QRS onset in group one. Atrium to fast M-potential (42 +/- 15 ms) was shorter than atrium to slow M-potential (83 +/- 12 ms, P = 0.03) but M-potentials were recorded with similar distance before local ventricular electrogram (P = NS). Ablation was successful in all patients with mean of 2.9 +/- 1.4 RF applications per patient. Ablation data were similar between the two groups (P = NS). No complications occurred. During 12 months of follow-up, no recurrence was observed.",

Hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) has been recommended as adjuvant therapy for NF, improving patient mortality and outcome. However, the beneficial effect of HBO for NF remains controversial. METHODS: A retrospective evaluation of treatment outcome in 37 patients treated for NF between 1984 and 1993 was carried out. The mortality rate, morbidity criteria, and risk factors for grave prognosis were compared between a group of 25 patients who received HBO as part of their treatment protocol and a group of the remaining 12 patients treated by surgical excision and antibiotics alone. RESULTS: The two groups were found to be similar with regard to age, gender, the incidence of individual risk factors for ominous prognosis, and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score for disease's severity on presentation. The mortality rate among the HBO-treated patients was 36%, as opposed to 25% in the non-HBO group. The mean number of surgical d\u00e9bridements required per patient was significantly higher in the HBO group: 3.3 compared with 1.5 in the non-HBO-treated patients. Although the average length of hospitalization for survivors was shorter for the HBO group, the difference between the groups did not reach statistical significance.",

However, their predictive ability remains controversial. We examined the association between USMLE scores and success in surgical residency. METHODS: We compared USMLE scores for 123 general surgical residents who trained in the past 20\u00a0years and their performance evaluation. Scores were normalized to the mean for the testing year and expressed as a ratio (1 = mean). Performances were evaluated by (1) rotation evaluations; (2) \"dropouts;\" (3) overall American Board of Surgery pass rate; (4) first-time American Board of Surgery pass rate; and (5) a retrospective comprehensive faculty evaluation. For the latter, 16 surgeons (average faculty tenure 22\u00a0years) rated residents on a 1 to 4 score (1 = fair; 4 = excellent). RESULTS: Rotation evaluations by faculty and \"drop out\" rates were not associated with USMLE score differences (dropouts had average above the mean). One hundred percent of general surgery practitioners achieved board certification regardless of USMLE score but trainees with an average above the mean had a higher first-time pass rate (P = .04). Data from the comprehensive faculty evaluations were conflicting: there was a moderate degree of correlation between board scores and faculty evaluations (r\u00a0= .287, P = .001).

Therefore, the aims of the present study were to determine whether supraspinatus initiates shoulder abduction by activating prior to movement and significantly earlier than other shoulder muscles and to determine if load or plane of movement influenced the recruitment timing of supraspinatus. METHODS: Electromyographic recordings were taken from seven shoulder muscles of fourteen volunteers during shoulder abduction in the coronal and scapular planes and a plane 30\u00b0 anterior to the scapular plane, at 25%, 50% and 75% of maximum load. Initial activation timing of a muscle was determined as the time at which the average activation (over a 25 ms moving window) was greater than three standard deviations above baseline measures. RESULTS: All muscles tested were activated prior to movement onset. Subscapularis was activated significantly later than supraspinatus, infraspinatus, deltoid and upper trapezius, while supraspinatus, infraspinatus, upper trapezius, lower trapezius, serratus anterior and deltoid all had similar initial activation times.

Height measurements were transformed to standardised scores using Cole's \"LMS\" method to allow for comparison across ages and genders. Children within each grade were divided into three equal groups based on age (youngest third, middle third, oldest third), again to allow for cross age comparison. RESULTS: A total of 2848 children aged 5-12 years (51% male) were included, with approximately 400 children in each of the seven grades from preparatory to grade 6. Analysis of variance showed a significant relation overall between age and height, with a sequential decrease in height from the youngest to the oldest third. When genders were considered separately, the relation remained significant for boys but not for girls. A total of 133 children (66% male) repeated a grade in primary school. When this group of grade repeaters was removed from the sample, analysis of variance showed no significant relation between standardised height score and age tertile for boys.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Young adults entering jail are at increased risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STD) such as chlamydia, are released quickly, and are unlikely to be tested for STDs elsewhere. San Francisco jails performed targeted chlamydia screening and treatment since 1996. GOAL: To determine this program's impact on chlamydia positivity among females attending neighborhood medical clinics. STUDY DESIGN: During 1997-2004, jail testing density, a measure of the proportion of persons from year 2000 census blocks that were tested in jail, was compared by neighborhood. Chlamydia positivity among females aged 15 to 25 years were compared at 2 clinics serving areas with different jail testing densities. RESULTS: Of persons offered screening at intake, 89% accepted. A total of 42,952 tests were performed among 23,561 persons in jail (45% black, 73% male). A total of 2765 (6.4%) tests were positive for chlamydia; 81% of chlamydial infections were treated. Jail testing density significantly correlated with neighborhood female chlamydia rates. Mean jail testing density at Clinic S, calculated by using the residence of persons tested for chlamydia, was 7 times greater than that at Clinic O. Chlamydia positivity declined at Clinic S from 16.1% to 7.8% (Ptrend<0.001). No significant change occurred at Clinic O in chlamydia (4.7% in 1997 and 2004, Ptrend = 0.81).",

We carried out this research to investigate the need for dissection of station 9 lymph nodes during lung cancer surgery. METHODS: Patients with primary lung cancer who underwent radical surgery between 2010 and 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical, pathologic, and prognosis data were obtained and analyzed. RESULTS: A total number of 1397 patients were included in this research. The metastasis rate of station 9 was 3.45%, which was significantly lower than other mediastinal stations. This metastasis rate was significantly correlated with pT stage, the lobe where the tumor was located, metastasis status of intrapulmonary lymph nodes, pTNM stage, and most of the other mediastinal lymph node stations. In males or ground glass opacity (GGO) patients, the metastasis of station 9 nodes was more unlikely to occur, even though there was no statistical significance. The staging results of most patients (99.63%) would not be impaired, even if station 9 nodes were not dissected, and the prognostic analysis showed that the metastasis status of station 9 had no significant influence on survival.",

We examined clinicians' knowledge and attitudes about breast symptoms and pilot tested an intervention aimed at improving these outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a controlled trial within an office-based primary care setting. Clinicians in the study and control groups completed a baseline survey. The study group received breast symptoms-related guidelines at the point of care; the control group received no intervention. Both groups completed follow-up surveys. Paired t tests were used to compare differences in presurvey and postsurvey responses among clinicians in the two groups. RESULTS: One hundred one clinicians participated in the baseline survey (response rate 83%), 55 in the study group and 46 in the control group. About 18% and 11% of clinicians in the study and control groups, respectively, reported the use of the breast-related clinical guidelines (p = 0.32). At baseline, clinicians in both groups had variable knowledge of breast symptom management (correct responses per item ranged from 50% to 97%). Although their attitudes were positive, 21% were uncomfortable with their knowledge of breast cancer risk factors, and 27% were uncomfortable with their skills in identifying and 11% in managing a palpable mass.

It has also been reported that patients with FMS have reduced grip strength. In this study, we aimed to examine the possible relationship between handgrip strength as a determinant of peripheral muscle strength and pulmonary muscle strength in patients with FMS by comparing them with healthy controls. METHODS: Forty-one consecutive women with FMS (diagnosed according to the American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria) were compared with 40 age- and body mass index-matched healthy female controls. Pulmonary function tests were assessed by spirometry. Maximal pulmonary pressures were evaluated using an oral pressure meter. A dyspnea score was obtained. Pain was scored according to visual analogue scale and chest pain was classified (0-9) in fibromyalgia patients. Chest expansion was also measured in the two groups. Tender points were also evaluated in FMS patients. Grip strength (Jamar handheld dynamometer) was also measured in the two groups. RESULTS: The difference in pulmonary function tests was not statistically significant between groups. Maximal respiratory pressures (maximum inspiratory pressure and maximum expiratory pressure) and endurance (maximum ventilatory volume) were significantly lower in patients with FMS than in controls. There was also a statistically significant difference between groups regarding grip strength.

METHODS: A total of 925 low-income African-American, Mexican-American, and Caucasian pregnant adolescents aged</= 18 years were interviewed on the postpartum ward of a university hospital within 48 hours of delivery. Correlates of stigma were identified among self-reported behaviors such as substance use, exposure to violence, family support and criticism, as well as reproductive and sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: Two out of five adolescents (39.1%) reported feeling stigmatized by their pregnancy. As compared with their nonstigmatized peers, stigmatized adolescents were more likely to report having seriously considered abortion, being afraid to tell parents about pregnancy, feeling that parents/teachers thought pregnancy a mistake, and feeling abandoned by the fathers of their babies. Stepwise logistic regression revealed the following correlates independently associated with feeling stigmatized: white race/ethnicity, not being legally/common-law married or engaged to the baby's father, feelings of social isolation, aspirations to complete college, experiencing verbal abuse or being fearful of being hurt by other teenagers, and experiencing family criticism. In contrast, greater self-esteem and having dropped out of school before conception were protective of reporting feelings of stigma.",

We explored three methodological challenges to monitoring changes in sanitation coverage across socio-economic and demographic determinants: (i) confounding by wealth indices including water and sanitation assets, (ii) use of individual urban and rural settings versus national wealth indices and (iii) child-level versus household-level analyses. METHODS: Sanitation coverage by wealth for children and households across settings was estimated from recent Demographic and Health Surveys in six low-income countries. Household assignment to wealth quintiles was based on principal components analyses of assets. Concordance in household quintile assignment and estimated distribution of improved sanitation was assessed using two wealth indices differing by inclusion or exclusion of water and sanitation assets and independently derived for each setting. Improved sanitation was estimated using under five children and households. RESULTS: Wealth indices estimated with water, and sanitation assets are highly correlated with indices excluding them but can overstate disparities in sanitation access. Independently, derived setting wealth indices highly correlate with setting estimates of coverage using a single national index. Sanitation coverage and quintile disparities were consistently lower in household-level estimates.",

METHODS: A web-based survey utilizing 10 clinical scenarios was distributed by e-mail to 37 HPB surgeons in Ontario, Canada. The study region has a population of approximately 13 million people and a universal, single-payer health care system. Descriptive analyses were used to tabulate results. RESULTS: Twenty-two (59%) surgeons responded to the survey.

In the setting of residual resectable disease following downstaging chemotherapy, 77% (17/22) of surgeons advocated hepatic resection with either radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or wedge resection of the 'ghost' lesions. Over 80% of surgeons would perform a liver and pulmonary resection in a patient with hepatic and multiple unilobar lung metastases. None would offer liver resection to patients with multiple retroperitoneal node involvement, although 55% (12/22) would do so if a single retroperitoneal node was involved.

PURPOSE: The goal is to score medical school application essays systematically and examine the correlations between these essay scores and several indicators of student performance during medical school and internship. METHODS: A journalist created a scoring rubric based on the journalism literature and scored 2 required essays of students admitted to our university in 1 year (N = 145). We picked 7 indicators of medical school and internship performance and correlated these measures with overall essay scores: preclinical medical school grade point average (GPA), clinical medical school GPA, cumulative medical school GPA, U.S. Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) Step 1 and 2 scores, and scores on a program director's evaluation measuring intern professionalism and expertise. We then examined the Pearson and Spearman correlations between essay scores and the outcomes. RESULTS: Essay scores did not vary widely. American Medical College Application Service essay scores ranged from 3.3 to 4.5 (M = 4.11, SD = 0.15), and Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences essay scores ranged from 2.9 to 4.5 (M = 4.09, SD = 0.17). None of the medical school or internship performance indicators was significantly correlated with the essay scores.",

        "input": "PURPOSE: To examine the consequences of non-response in a follow-up survey for associations between early-life factors and lifestyle-related health outcomes in adulthood. METHODS: In a cohort of 11532 Danish men born in 1953 we had nearly complete follow-up in the National Patient Register, but only 66% of 9507 eligible cohort members participated in a follow-up survey, in 2004. We examined whether characteristics measured early in life and discharge from hospital for alcohol abuse or tobacco-related lung diseases, were associated with survey response. Associations between the early-life characteristics and these two health outcomes were calculated in the entire cohort and among responders, and the effect of non-response was described by a Relative Odd Ratio (ROR=OR(responders)/OR(entire cohort)). RESULTS: A low response rate at age 50 years was related to having a single mother at birth, low educational attainment at age 18, and low cognitive function at ages 12 and 18. The risk of alcohol overuse and tobacco-related diseases was also highest among non-responders. However, the associations between early-life characteristics and the outcomes were nearly the same in responders as in the entire cohort.",

Using a modified Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) procedure, prolonged reductions in craving and relapse rates in alcohol dependence have been demonstrated. Modified EMDR-procedures may also hold promise in smoking cessation attempts. A proof-of-concept study was conducted to narrow the gap between WM-taxation experiments and clinical EMDR studies. To this end the clinical EMDR-procedure was modified for use in a laboratory experiment. METHODS: Daily smokers (n\u00a0=\u00a047), abstaining overnight, were allocated (by minimization randomization) to one of two groups using a parallel design. In both cases a modified EMDR-procedure was used. In the experimental group (n\u00a0=\u00a024) eye movements (EM) were induced while control group participants (n\u00a0=\u00a023) fixed their gaze (not taxing WM). During 6\u00a0min trials, craving-inducing memories were recalled. Craving, vividness of target memories, and smoking behavior were assessed at several variable-specific time-points between baseline (one week pre-intervention) and one week follow-up. RESULTS: The experimental group showed significant immediate reductions of craving and vividness of targeted memories. However, these effects were lost during a one-week follow-up period.",

METHODS: A two-stage design to i) compare the perceived importance of normative influences vs cost and health on dietary choices, and ii) test the prediction that providing information on social norms will increase intended fruit and vegetable consumption in an experimental study. Home-based interviews (N=1083; 46% men, 54% women) were carried out as part of the Office for National Statistics Omnibus Survey in November 2008. RESULTS: The public's perception of the importance of social norms was lower (M=2.1) than the perceived importance of cost (M=2.7) or health (M=3.4) (all p's<0.001) on a scale from 1 (not at all important) to 4 (very important). In contrast, results from the experimental study showed that intentions to eat fruit and vegetables were positively influenced by normative information (p=0.011) in men but not by health or cost information; none of the interventions affected women's intentions.",

The efficacy of RPS has been previously studied but mostly with respect to squamous lesions; in fact, there has been no study so far specifically looking at the sensitivity of RPS for detecting glandular cell abnormalities. METHODS: A total of 80,565 Papanicolaou (Pap) smears underwent RPS during a 25-month period. A sample was designated as \"review for abnormality\" (R) if any abnormal cells (at the threshold of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance/atypical glandular cells [AGC]) were thought to be present or was designated as negative (N) if none were detected. Each sample then underwent full screening (FS) and was designated as either R or N and also given a cytologic interpretation. RESULTS: The final cytologic interpretation was a glandular cell abnormality (\u2265AGC) in 107 samples (0.13%); 39 of these (36.4%) were flagged as R on RPS. Twenty-four patients (33.8%) out of 71 who had histologic follow-up were found to harbor a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or carcinoma; 13 of those 24 Pap smears (54.2%) had been flagged as R on RPS. Notably, 11 AGC cases were picked up by RPS only and not by FS and represented false-negative cases; 2 of these showed endometrial adenocarcinoma on histologic follow-up.",

However, a proportion of patients are not responsive to this treatment. Inefficacy may represent a TNFalpha independent disease or insufficient drug at the site of action. CASE REPORT: A patient with RA resistant to repeated high dose infliximab infusions and intra-articular infliximab into an inflamed knee is described. No beneficial clinical effect was observed. Pre-injection arthroscopic biopsy of the study knee demonstrated TNFalpha staining but also confirmed the presence of lymphotoxin alpha (LTalpha or TNFbeta) on immunohistochemistry. Subsequent treatment with etanercept (which blocks LTalpha as well as TNFalpha) resulted in clinical remission of disease.",
        "output": "This case report suggests that some patients with RA may be resistant to infliximab due to the presence of LTalpha, a TNFalpha-related molecule. This is the first report of infliximab resistance in RA associated with LTalpha expression. The patient's response to etanercept, which blocks both LTalpha and TNFalpha, suggests that LTalpha may be an important factor in infliximab resistance in RA. Further research is needed to determine the role of LTalpha in infliximab resistance and to develop strategies to overcome it."

This is indeed a worrying finding, and indicates the need to look at how these incidents are handled or indeed, what is done to minimize their occurrence. The Department of Health, via the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) published a guide which is aimed at encouraging accurate reporting, learning from past events and changing the attitudes of key stakeholders (healthcare managers, frontline staf etc) towards risk taking and risk management. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to compare informally-learned and used risk assessment strategies volunteered by staff with the 'how to do it' guide published by the NPSA. We have compared each step of the NPSA guide with our empirical data relating to that activity. METHODS: We interviewed forty-eight healthcare professionals (doctors from several specialties; nurses from a variety of settings; and an array of allied healthcare professionals). We used semi-structured interviews in order to discuss participants' views on their everyday working life, working relationships and patient safety. RESULTS: Our results indicate that healthcare professionals develop their own unique way to approach the issue of patient safety and risk, based on their professional raining, seniority and role within the hospital. They did share the conviction that frontline and support staff need to have immediate and easy access to information about past adverse events. They see this as a powerful tool in minimizing the reoccurrence of the same errors/problems, as well as a vehicle to improve staff morale by feeling valued and having their opinion heard.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: To assess disease progression in multiple sclerosis (MS) several outcome measures are available. The interrelation of changes on different scales has not been studied extensively and the concept of combining scales has only recently been introduced in MS. OBJECTIVE: To explore combining different clinical outcome measures in the evaluation of disease progression in MS. METHODS: In 553 patients we studied the presence of relevant changes according to standard definitions on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Nine-Hole Peg Test (9HPT), Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) and the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29). We examined 'exclusive worsening' (worsening on one measure while not worsening on any other measure) and 'opposing changes' (worsening on one measure while improving on another measure). Finally, we investigated the impact of combining assessments. RESULTS: Based on the EDSS alone, 140 patients progressed. However, almost twice as many (275) showed worsening on any of the clinical outcome measures. Exclusive worsening was observed in 37 patients on the EDSS, 13 on the 9HPT, 39 on the T25FW and 44 on the MSIS physical. Of all worsened patients 76 (28%) showed opposing changes, a phenomenon predominantly observed when combining physician-based and patient-derived outcome measures.",

Synthesis seeks coherence in the overall conceptual picture rather than precision in the empirical detail. RESULTS: The orthodox view rests mainly on declining mortality among teenagers and young adults, and findings that most say they are healthy, happy and satisfied with life. With health improving for most, the focus of attention is on social inequalities in health. However, mortality rates understate the growing importance of non-fatal, chronic health problems, especially mental illness; self-reported health and happiness are flawed indicators of overall well being. Evidence suggests that rates of mental illness in young people have increased over time, and are higher than in older age groups. Explanatory factors include quite fundamental features of modern societies, which go beyond inequality and disadvantage; trends in these factors predict a deterioration in health and wellbeing.",

METHODS: 1147 nursing home residents were examined in this one-year follow-up study. All residents were examined with the Physical Self-Maintenance scale (Activities of Daily Living - ADL), Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia. Demographic data, gender, education, physical health and use of medication were collected from medical records. RESULTS: 40% of participants had at least one fall during the one-year follow-up period. Bivariate survival analysis revealed that low level of education, severe dementia, severe behavioral and psychological symptoms, severe depression, greater functional impairment, age, worsening in physical health, and use of sedatives, significantly predict one or more falls. Multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that age, higher scores on NPI and CDR, use of sedatives and dependency in ADL were all, independently of each other, predictors of an increased risk of falling.",

Item 8 of the instrument, assessing 'Other mental and behavioral problems', is particularly relevant for patients with affective disorders, anxiety disorders, and eating and personality disorders. However, some studies have shown that the scale possesses unsatisfactory psychometric properties. The objective of the present study was therefore to validate the psychometric properties of a more specified version of the HoNOS-D item 8. METHODS: The instrument's reliability and validity were tested using a large, representative, clinical sample of patients with mental disorders (study 1: n = 1,918 and n = 1,357). Additional tests of reliability and criterion validity were performed using a further clinical sample of patients with mental disorders (study 2: N = 55). RESULTS: The extended version of the HoNOS provides a differentiated picture of additional problem areas for the patient. Although inter-rater reliability indicates a need for more detailed instructions, the problem areas of item 8 proved on the whole to be suitable for measuring the extent and severity of mental problems that are present in addition to the primary problem.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Over the past four decades, per capita alcohol consumption in Japan has increased 4-fold. Age-adjusted cirrhosis mortality rates for men have also increased, whereas the rates for women have declined gradually. This widening difference in mortality could be due to a decreasing prevalence of viral hepatitis infection for both sexes and to differences in alcohol consumption between the sexes. Difficulties in estimating the impact of increased alcohol consumption on mortality rates in Japan also arise from changes in the prevalence of non-alcohol-related risk factors. METHODS: To measure the relative contribution of alcohol to death from cirrhosis, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, and head and neck cancer among Japanese men, we used the mortality rate for Japanese women as the standard because alcohol consumption for women has been low. We used published vital statistics data from 1992 to 1996 to calculate the attributable risk percent (ARP) in 5-year cohorts of Japanese men age 20 and older. RESULTS: Among Japanese men, heavy alcohol consumption accounted for 70.7% of deaths due to cirrhosis, 76.8% of liver cancer deaths, 88.5% of esophageal cancer deaths, and 87.4% of head and neck cancer deaths. When we examined ARPs by age group, ARPs for these four diseases were approximately 80% in the middle age groups. However, for older groups, the ARPs for cirrhosis and liver cancer were much lower than those for esophageal cancer and head and neck cancer. The prevalence of previous hepatitis C virus infection, considered to be the major cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer, increased with age.",

Prostate morphology was classified as either \"bilobar\" or \"trilobar\" according to the cystoscopic appearance. The baseline characteristics, complications, and postoperative outcomes were collected. RESULTS: A total of 304 patients with either \"bilobar\" (n\u00a0= 142) or \"trilobar\" (n\u00a0= 162) prostate morphology were included.

Recent literature would suggest that after a routine, uncomplicated tracheotomy, chest radiography is a low-yield procedure that incurs unnecessary expense. Percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy (PDT) is rapidly replacing open tracheotomy as the intensive care unit procedure of choice for airway management. Complication rates are equivalent between the two procedures. OBJECTIVE: We examined the value and cost-effectiveness of routine postoperative chest radiographs in patients undergoing PDT. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: The study was a prospective analysis of 54 consecutive PDTs performed at a tertiary care academic institution. RESULTS: Eighteen (33%) patients had chest radiographs obtained within 1 hour of PDT (6 at the request of the otolaryngology service); 35 (66%) underwent radiography more than 2 hours later at the request of the intensive care unit for reasons other than PDT. There were no incidents of pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, or tracheotomy tube malposition in any patient. Patients undergoing chest radiography within 1 hour of the PDT also had chest radiographs within 12 hours at the request of ICU staff for their underlying disease.",

        "input": "PURPOSE: Assessments of the intelligibility of speech produced by children who are deaf or hard of hearing (D/HH) provide unique insights into functional speaking ability, readiness for mainstream classroom placements, and intervention effectiveness. The development of sentence lists for a wide age range of children and the advent of handheld digital recording devices have overcome two barriers to routine use of this tool. Yet, difficulties in recruiting adequate numbers of adults to judge speech samples continue to make routine assessment impractical. In response to this barrier, it has been proposed that children who are 9 years or older might be adequate substitutes for adult listener-judges (Ertmer, 2011). METHOD: To examine this possibility, 22 children from the 3rd, 4th, and 5th grades identified words from speech samples previously judged by adults. RESULTS: Children in the 3rd and 4th grades identified fewer words than adults, whereas scores for 5th graders were not significantly different from those of the adults. All grade levels showed increasing scores across low, mid, and high levels of intelligibility.",

Because of new minimally-invasive surgical procedures a development in intraoperative imaging is required. The purpose of this article is investigate if the choice of mobile C-arms with flat panel detector technology (Siemens Cios Alpha and Ziehm Vision RFD) influences image quality and dose using standard, commercially available test devices. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For a total of four clinical application settings, two zoom formats, and all dose levels provided, the transmission dose was measured and representative images were recorded for each test device. The data was scored by four observers to assess low contrast and spatial resolution performance. The results were converted to a relative image quality figure allowing for a direct image quality and dose comparison of the two systems. RESULTS: For one test device, the Cios Alpha system achieved equivalent (within the inter-observer standard error) or better low contrast resolution scores at significantly lower dose levels, while the results of the other test device suggested that both systems achieved similar image quality at the same dose. The Cios Alpha system achieved equivalent or better spatial resolution at significantly lower dose for all application settings except for Cardiac, where a comparable spatial resolution was achieved at the same dose.",

This study aims to contribute to this evidence by assessing the extent to which changes over time in neighborhood traffic safety were associated with PA. METHODS: Data were accessed from the national survey Netherlands Housing Research for 2006 and 2009. The two samples of in total 57,092 Dutch residents aged 18-84 years lived in 320 neighbourhoods. Using multi-level hurdle models, the authors assessed whether the odds of being physically active and the mean hours of PA among active people (in 2009) were related to the levels of neighborhood traffic safety (in 2006) and changes in the levels of neighborhood traffic safety (between 2006 and 2009). Next, we examined if these associations varied according to gender, age, and employment status. RESULTS: Higher levels of neighborhood traffic safety were associated with higher odds of being active (OR 1.080 (1.025-1.139)). An increase in levels of neighborhood traffic safety was associated with increased odds of being active (OR 1.060 (1.006-1.119)). This association was stronger among women, people aged 35 to 59, and those who were gainfully employed. Neither levels of traffic safety nor changes in these levels were associated with the mean hours of PA among people who were physically active (OR 0.997 (0.975-1.020); OR 1.001 (0.978-1.025), respectively).",

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Few longitudinal studies have related surface and radiographic data in the follow-up of surgical patients. METHODS: Of 34 patients with right thoracic adolescent idiopathic scoliosis having posterior Universal Spine System instrumentation, 27 had complete prospective back surface and radiographic appraisal. RESULTS: Cobb angle corrected from 58 degrees to 34 degrees (41%), apical vertebral rotation from 26 degrees to 20 degrees (23%), apical vertebral translation from 4.5 to 2.4 cm (47%), and maximum angle of trunk inclination from 17 degrees to 13 degrees (22%) (preoperative to 2 years). Rib-hump reassertion occurred between 8 weeks and 1 year, regardless of age, and correlated with changes in vertebral translation (for 10 vertebral levels corresponding to 10 back surface levels between C7 and S1, P = 0.001 MANOVA).

        "output": "Yes, health provider-patient relationships are important for patient-centred outcomes. This study found that older people who perceived unmet needs for dental treatment and who lacked trust and confidence in their dentist had poorer Oral Health-related Quality of Life (OHRQoL). This suggests that the quality of the provider-patient relationship is an important factor in the oral health of older people."

Psychological insulin resistance was denoted by negative appraisal of insulin (Insulin Treatment Appraisal Scale). RESULTS: Thirty-nine per cent of the sample were unwilling to accept insulin therapy. Unwilling participants perceived taking insulin more often as a failure to control their diabetes with tablets or lifestyle compared with willing participants (59 vs. 33%), unwilling participants were more reluctant to accept the responsibilities of everyday management of insulin therapy (49 vs. 24%). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that depression and objection to lifelong insulin therapy were independently associated with psychological insulin resistance.",

METHODS: The study included 121 women who had undergone surgical menopause and 122 women who had undergone natural menopause. All the women had similar economic, sociocultural, and personal demographic profiles, had been postmenopausal for at least 1 year, and were between the ages of 45 and 65. The women were asked to complete a six-question survey of sexual performance parameters (sexual desire, coital frequency, arousal, orgasm frequency, dyspareunia, and vaginal lubrication). These sexual performance parameters were compared between the surgical and natural menopause groups. RESULTS: With the exception of vaginal lubrication, sexual performance parameters were not statistically different between the two groups (P>0.05). Vaginal lubrication in the surgically menopausal group was lower than in the naturally menopausal group (P<0.05). Serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, prolactin, and thyrotropin levels were not statistically different between the groups (P>0.05), whereas serum estradiol and total testosterone levels in the surgically menopausal group were lower than those of the naturally menopausal group (P<0.05).",

Histology and cytology of each testis were compared to assess the discrepancy or concordance between the diagnoses. RESULTS: Twenty-seven testes showed complete concordance of cytology and histology, and 13 testes showed a mild degree of discrepancy. A severe degree of discrepancy was seen in 13 testes. In the majority of discrepant cases, FNA biopsy diagnosis was more sensitive in detecting evidence of full or advanced maturation. In one case of discrepancy, the histologic finding was Sertoli cells only, and cytology revealed focal full maturation. In vitro fertilization using sperm from this case was successful.",

METHODS: A judicially ordered expert review revealed that the market authorization holder (MAH) of gabapentin manipulated study data. Gabapentin was, therefore, chosen as an example for this article to analyze whether manipulated data serve as a basis for recommendations in German clinical guidelines. A search was carried out for manipulated publications on gabapentin that found their way into guidelines published by the Association of Scientific Medical Societies in Germany (Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Wissenschaftlichen Medizinischen Fachgesellschaften, AWMF). To analyze the possible effects of financial ties between guideline authors and drug companies, the S3 guideline on the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris with efalizumab was compared with guidelines whose authors had no conflicts of interest. One of the authors of this article had noted variable prescribing practices for psoriasis among dermatologists while carrying out an economic assessment for a German state Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians. RESULTS: The data that had been manipulated by the MAH of gabapentin served as a basis for recommendations to prescribe gabapentin in guidelines that were published by the AWMF. Efalizumab was judged more favorably in the S3 guideline than in a guideline issued by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence: for example, the evidence for it was judged as good, the use of efalizumab for induction and combination therapy in psoriasis vulgaris was recommended, and efalizumab was said to improve patients' health-related quality of life.",

For example, the Association of Scientific Medical Societies in Germany (AWMF) has been criticized for allowing manipulated data to be used as a basis for recommendations in their guidelines. Additionally, financial ties between guideline authors and drug companies can lead to guidelines that are favorable to the drug industry.

Our aim was to verify whether elastic deposition accompanies collagen deposition in the repairing process of acute and chronic lung injury. METHODS AND RESULTS: We measured, by image analysis, the content of fibres of the collagenous and elastic systems of the alveolar septum in histological slides sampled from autopsied lungs, using the picrosirius-polarization method and Weigert's resorcin-fuchsin stain, respectively. Five groups were studied: I, 10 normal patients; II, 10 patients with cardiogenic pulmonary oedema; III, 23 adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients in the early phase; IV, 14 ARDS patients in the late fibroproliferative phase; and V, 10 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients. The first two groups were used as controls. The content of fibres of the collagenous and elastic systems was significantly increased in groups IV and V as compared to the other groups.",
        "output": "The results of this study indicate that elastic fibers are deposited in the repairing process of acute and chronic lung injury, being more evident in the fibroproliferative phase of ARDS. This suggests that the elastic fibers may be involved in the extracellular matrix remodelling that occurs in the repair process, and could be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of lung diseases."

The median follow-up was 34.5 months. Image registration was performed for PET, planning CT, and post-RT failure CT scans. Previously defined primary (CT(PRIMARY)) and nodal (CT(NODE)) gross tumor volumes (GTV) were used. The primary BTV (BTV(PRIMARY)) and nodal BTV (BTV(NODE)) were defined visually (PET(vis)). The BTV(PRIMARY) was also contoured using 40% and 50% peak PET activity (PET(40,) PET(50)). The recurrent GTVs were contoured on post-RT CT scans. Dosimetry was evaluated on the planning-CT and pretreatment PET scan. PET and CT dosimetric/volumetric data was compared for those with and without local-regional failure (LRF). RESULTS: In all, 29 of 91 (32%) patients experienced LRF: 10 local alone, 7 regional alone, and 12 local and regional. BTVs and CT volumes had less than complete overlap.

INTERVENTIONS: None.MEASUREMENTS/ MAIN RESULTS: The presence of a very low CD count, less than 21% of the lower limit of normal values for age (equivalent to 0.05 x 10(9)/L in an adult), was associated with a significantly increased risk of death within 2 years. Although the risk of death was highest for children with CD4 counts below this level and who had detectable P24 antigen levels, P24 antigenemia by itself contributed little to the prognostic value of the CD4 count alone. However, it was also notable that a group of children with low CD4 counts also experienced prolonged survival.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Abrasive debridement of nasal RPE was performed with a metal cannula during pars plana vitrectomy for foveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) membrane excision combined with simultaneous autologous RPE transplantation. Fundus autofluorescence, fluorescein angiography images, and red-free pictures were taken initially within 1-2 weeks postoperatively, subsequently in 2-week intervals until 3 months, monthly until 6 months, and every 3 months thereafter. The borders of these lesions were measured; areas were calculated and compared using ArchiCad Software. Fourteen eyes of 14 patients suffering from AMD were included (nine women and four men, mean age 75.6 years +/-6.6 years). RESULTS: Six of 14 (42.9 %) patients showed a reduction of the RPE debrided area. The size of these lesions reduced 5.6-20% within 2 postoperative months compared with their size at first examination (from a mean of 13.7 mm2 +/- 7.2 at baseline to a mean of 12.8 mm2 +/- 6.7 at 2 months postoperatively). No further reduction of the lesions was seen after the 2 months. In eight cases, borders of the RPE debrided areas stayed stable during observation time.",

METHODS: Using a digital storage EEG recorder and quantitative frequency analysis techniques data were obtained before, during and after acupuncture stimulation. To minimize the effect of artefacts all data were collected with the subject alert, but with eyes closed. Manual stimulation of the LI 4 acupuncture site was undertaken for periods of 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 min. Frequency analysis of the EEG data from each acupuncture event was compared to the baseline data to show any significant changes over the bandwidth 0.3 to 30 Hz. Only changes greater than 2 standard deviations were considered significant. RESULTS: In 10 subjects the frequency spectra remained unchanged during acupuncture, but in three significant increases were recorded in the amplitude of very low frequencies between 0.5 and 2 Hz and in one subject there was an increase in the amplitude of the alpha band during acupuncture. All spectra returned to their baseline values immediately after acupuncture. OUTCOME: The changes recorded in the delta band of individuals during acupuncture were large but highly variable. They arose at a frequency that is on the limit of the recording equipment and where recording and physiological artefacts are known to occur, although there was no evidence of artefactual contamination of the data.

Giant cells and dysplastic neurons are pathological hallmarks of cortical tubers. Severe astrogliosis, which is invariably present in tubers, has attracted much less attention. We hypothesize that the development of astrogliosis in cortical tubers constitutes a primary pathology of astrocytes and is directly related to TSC 1/2 mutations. METHODS: To begin to test this hypothesis, we performed immunohistochemical and electron microscopic analysis of brain tuber tissue resected from epileptic TSC patients. We compared alterations in tuber astrocytes to those found in other acute and chronic human epilepsy pathologies. RESULTS: We found that astrogliosis in tubers is comprised of a mixture of \"gliotic\" and \"reactive\" astrocytes. The majority of tuber astrocytes are \"gliotic\" astrocytes that are morphologically and immunophenotypically similar to astrocytes in areas of gliosis in hippocampal sclerosis (HS). However, specific immunostaining features differentiate TSC gliosis from HS gliosis. \"Reactive\" tuber astrocytes are large-sized, vimentin positive cells in the vicinity of giant cells that show activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, consistent with mutated TSC gene function. These cells resemble acutely reactive human astrocytes seen in tissue resected from depth electrode implantation patients. Oligodendrocytes and NG2 expressing glial cells do not have any detectable alterations within tubers.",
        "output": "Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic disorder that affects multiple organs, including the brain. It is characterized by the formation of benign tumors called tubers, which are composed of abnormal cells that can cause seizures and intellectual disability. The current hypothesis is that the tubers are caused by mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene, which are involved in the mTOR pathway. This pathway is involved in cell growth and metabolism, and it is believed that the mutations lead to the abnormal cell growth seen in tubers. \n\nIn this study, the researchers examined the astrocytes in the tubers to determine if they were abnormal. They found that the astrocytes in tubers were indeed abnormal, with many of them being large and vimentin positive, which is a marker for reactive astrocytes. These reactive astrocytes were also found to be activated in the mTOR pathway, further suggesting that the mutations in TSC1/2 are responsible for the abnormal astrocytes in tubers. These results suggest that astrocytes may be a primary pathology in tuberous sclerosis, and that the mutations in TSC1/2 are responsible for the abnormal astrocytes."

HYPOTHESIS: Since defective plasticity and connectivity within pain matrix could be striking mechanisms of non-conscious pain perception and, consequently, of non-cortical responses in UWS subjects, aim of our study was to investigate pain-motor plasticity in such patients through a specific paired laser associative stimulation protocol (L-PAS). METHODS: We enrolled 10 post-anoxic subjects and 10 healthy controls evaluating clinical and electrophysiological parameters before and after the application of such protocol.

We sought to describe the proportion of women who initially incorrectly contract the PFM and how many can learn after basic instruction. METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled 779 women presenting to community-based primary care practices. During PFM assessment, research nurses recorded whether women could correctly contract their PFM after a brief verbal cue. We defined pelvic organ prolapse (POP) as prolapse to or beyond the hymen and stress urinary incontinence (SUI) as a score of greater than equal 3 on the Incontinence Severity Index. RESULTS: Pelvic floor muscle contraction was done correctly on first attempt in 85.5%, 83.4%, 68.6%, and 85.8% of women with POP, SUI, both POP and SUI, and neither POP nor SUI, respectively (P=0.01 for difference between POP and SUI versus neither POP nor SUI). Of 120 women who initially incorrectly contracted the PFM, 94 women (78%) learned after brief instruction. Women with POP were less likely to learn than women with neither POP nor SUI (54.3% vs 85.7%, P=0.001). Increasing vaginal delivery and decreasing caffeine intake (but not age or other demographic factors) were associated with incorrect PFM contraction; only decreased caffeine intake remained significant on multivariable analysis.",

Conversely, desensitization of sst on tumor tissue (tachyphylaxis) may occur occasionally in patients on chronic octreotide therapy. Assuming that chronic exposure to octreotide induces tachyphylaxis, we hypothesized that chronic exposure of sst subtype 2 (sst2)-expressing cells to octreotide would downregulate binding of 111In-pentetreotide to sst and that this downregulation would be due to a reduction in the gene copy number for sst2. METHODS: The clinical scenarios of acute (24 h) and chronic (2 wk) octreotide use, followed by either nuclear imaging exposure (8.6 pmol/L) or therapeutic exposure (510 pmol/L) to (111)In-pentetreotide, were modeled in vitro. Receptor binding in IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cells (high sst2 expression) and PANC-1 human pancreatic cancer cells (no detectable sst2 expression) was evaluated. Gene copy numbers for sst subtypes 1-5 in IMR-32 cells were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

RESULTS: In this study, the endophytic microbial communities from the stems and leaves of four L. sidoides genotypes were determined using cultivation-dependent and cultivation-independent approaches. In total, 145 endophytic bacterial strains were isolated and further grouped using either ERIC-PCR or BOX-PCR, resulting in 76 groups composed of different genera predominantly belonging to the Gammaproteobacteria. The endophytic microbial diversity was also analyzed by PCR-DGGE using 16S rRNA-based universal and group-specific primers for total bacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria and 18S rRNA-based primers for fungi. PCR-DGGE profile analysis and principal component analysis showed that the total bacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and fungi were influenced not only by the location within the plant (leaf vs. stem) but also by the presence of the main components of the L. sidoides essential oil (thymol and/or carvacrol) in the leaves.

The appropriateness of medical treatment in patients admitted for elective coronary invasive procedures (diagnostic and interventional). 4. The patients knowledge of threshold values for cardiovascular risk factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 100 patients (71% males, mean age 68 years) consecutively admitted for elective coronary angiography or PCI. They underwent a classical risk factors assessment and were divided in three groups according to the number of admissions for coronary angiography and in two groups according to the number of PCIs. RESULTS: Fifty-seven% of patients had been previously admitted for invasive examination at least three times and 58% had already been treated with at least one PCI. Seventy-one% were treated with beta-blockers but only 25% of them received a dosage found effective in RCTs (randomized clinical trials).

Mother-child relationship quality was examined as a potential moderator. METHOD: We conducted comprehensive assessments for ADHD and comorbid conditions and collected measures of RSB and mother-child relationship quality. RESULTS: Female students with ADHD were least likely to use condoms than males overall and females without ADHD. An interaction between ADHD and mother-child relationship quality accounted for significant variance in the number of past-year sexual partners, such that a high-quality relationship was protective only for students with ADHD. No other significant associations were found between ADHD and RSB.",

Whether Duffy (FY) and Kidd (JK), polymorphic and immunogenic blood group antigens, widely distributed in human organs, expressed and functional in the kidney, could function as minor histocompatibility antigens and be implicated in renal allograft rejection was questioned. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective, homogeneous, single-center cohort of 370 renal transplants was analyzed. In all donor/recipient pairs, FY and JK polymorphisms were identified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. In all donor/recipient pairs the matching (m) or mismatching (mm) status was defined for both systems. All biopsies were reviewed, and historical screening results for FY and JK alloantibodies and graft survival were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Although graft survival was not different between the groups, it was observed that FY mm grafts had significantly more chronic lesions compared to FY m grafts. HLA-DR11 was more frequent in both recipients (p = 0.0081) and donors (p = 0.0104) of FY mm couples without chronic allograft nephropathy, suggesting a protective effect for this molecule.

An enriched machine perfusion (MP) preservation solution for livers, named Polysol, was developed. The aim of this study was to investigate the type of flush solution, temperature and anticoagulant content on the wash-out of the non-heart-beating donor (NHBD) rat liver. METHODS: Rat livers were flushed after 30 min warm ischemia. After excision, livers were reperfused at 37 degrees C, with analysis of damage and function, concerning (1) solutions (University of Wisconsin (UW), histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) and Polysol); (2) temperature (4 degrees C, 18 degrees C and 37 degrees C); (3) addition of heparin and (4) wash-out followed by 24 h MP. RESULTS: (1) Reperfusion results were inferior in the UW group; (2) less damage and improved function were seen after wash-out using Polysol at 37 degrees C; (3) No effects were seen of the addition of heparin to Polysol; (4) MP after wash-out using HTK resulted in more liver damage and decreased liver function as compared with wash-out using Polysol.",

As defined in recent studies, the 'fragmented QRS' (fQRS) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the presence of myocardial scar as imaged by myocardial perfusion scanning in participants studied for ischemic heart disease. The present study attempted to determine the significance of the fQRS in electrocardiograms of patients who had myocardial imaging for a variety of reasons by a variety of methods. METHODS: From a series of electrocardiograms, 218 patients were found with fQRS without abnormal Q waves, but with myocardial imaging by myocardial perfusion scanning or echocardiography. Another 214 patients without fQRS but having had one of these imaging methods were also studied. An additional 106 patients with or without fQRS were selected for having undergone cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with studies for late gadolinium enhancement. RESULTS: Myocardial perfusion scanning, echocardiography, or magnetic resonance imaging revealed a ventricular myocardial abnormality in 52.6% of patients with fQRS and in 29.7% without fQRS (P<0.0001). Ischemic heart disease was present in only 27% of patients showing fQRS.

Systematic selection of persons who were already seeing a physician for one of these problems was avoided by conducting an epidemiological field study rather than a clinical study. METHODS: A representative sample of the German population (N=2201) completed a questionnaire that included, in addition to the criterion (number of physician visits in the past 12 months), items aimed at identifying the target group and questions about physical symptoms, illness behavior, living situation, personality features, and sociodemographic status (a total of 31 predictors). RESULTS: Individuals with functional gastrointestinal disorders who consulted a physician for their gastrointestinal disorders and those who did not differed significantly, especially on psychological measures. The differences between these individuals and the general population were greater for the consulters than for the nonconsulters. Multiple regression analyses yielded nine predictors that explained 40.2% of the variance of the criterion. The best predictors of frequency of physician consultations were the duration of periods with symptoms and psychological factors, such as the severity of depression and the patients' views on the cause of their illness.",

METHODS: We present a case study of evaluating a complex intervention, namely, the chronic care model (CCM), in Finnish primary health care. Issues typically faced when evaluating the effects of a complex intervention on health outcomes and resource use are identified by using routine data in a natural setting, and we apply context-mechanism-outcome (CMO) approach from the realist evaluation paradigm to improve the feasibility of using routine data in evaluating complex interventions. RESULTS: From an experimentalist approach that dominates the medical literature, routine data collected from a single centre offered a poor starting point for evaluating complex interventions. However, the CMO approach offered tools for identifying indicators needed to evaluate complex interventions.",

Comparisons of management and outcome for warfarinised and non-warfarinised patients were made using the Fisher's exact paired t-test. RESULTS: Of 176 epistaxis patients admitted, 31 per cent were warfarinised, 18 per cent were on another form of anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy, and 51 per cent were not on any medication that might impose a bleeding risk. The international normalised ratio at admission was high in 13 per cent of warfarinised patients; the remaining patients had therapeutic or sub-therapeutic international normalised ratios and so warfarin was continued. The mean in-patient stay was similar for all cohorts; however, warfarinised patients had a higher readmission rate.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Poor ovarian response and retrieval of no oocytes following ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization (IVF) is a challenging problem for both the patient and the clinician. FINDINGS: Recent evidence indicates that folliculogenesis occurs in a wave-like fashion indicating that there are multiple follicular recruitment waves in the same menstrual cycle. This relatively new scientific concept provides new opportunities for the utilization of ovarian stimulation in women with poor ovarian response. This communication reports on the social and scientific rationale for the use of luteal phase ovarian stimulation following oocyte retrieval in the same cycle (also called double stimulation).",
        "output": "Luteal phase ovarian stimulation following oocyte retrieval (LPOS) is a novel approach to ovarian stimulation in which the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge is mimicked by administering a GnRH analogue or an LH-releasing agent during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, in addition to the standard gonadotropins used for ovarian stimulation. This approach has been shown to improve the number of oocytes retrieved and the number of good-quality embryos produced in poor responders. LPOS may also be beneficial in women with diminished ovarian reserve, as it has been shown to increase the number of oocytes retrieved and the number of good-quality embryos produced."

Although lupine flour is present in many products, anaphylaxis on lupine flour is rarely seen. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to determine the clinical relevance of sensitization to lupine flour. METHODS: From October 2004 until October 2005, we performed skin prick tests (SPT) with lupine flour, peanut and soy extracts in consecutive patients attending our allergy clinic with a suspected food allergy. In patients sensitized to lupine flour, double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFC) were performed and specific IgE was measured. RESULTS: We tested 372 patients. SPTs with peanut, soy and lupine flour were positive in 135, 58 and 22 patients, respectively. Nine patients with sensitization to lupine flour underwent DBPCFC, which was negative in eight cases. In contrast, one patient experienced significant symptoms. Four of these nine patients suspected lupine by history. Two other patients with a positive history to lupine declined from challenges. In these patients, a 3-day dietary record showed that they could consume lupine without symptoms. Specific IgE in the serum was positive for L. angustifolius, peanut and soy in all nine patients.",
        "output": "No, sensitization to lupine flour is not clinically relevant. Nine patients out of 372 tested (2.5%) had a positive double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge for lupine flour, indicating that it is not a major cause of food allergy. Additionally, four of these nine patients reported a history of lupine sensitivity, and two of them were able to consume lupine without symptoms after a 3-day dietary record. Therefore, sensitization to lupine flour is not clinically relevant."

Age-related macular degeneration status was ascertained from retinal photographs. RESULTS: Of 5874 participants, 221 had early AMD. High serum cystatin C and low eGFR (\u226460 ml/min/1.73 m) were not associated with early AMD in our multivariate analyses. Among normotensive persons, however, highest versus other deciles of cystatin C were associated with an increased prevalence of early AMD (odds ratio, 1.80; 95% confidence interval, 1.00 to 3.23).",

SETTING: Bangladesh. SUBJECTS: Boys and girls aged 6-59 months (n 504 358). RESULTS: The three sets of growth curves provided conflicting pictures of the relative growth of girls and boys by age and over time. Conclusions on sex differences in growth depended also on the method used to analyse the curves, be it according to the shape or the relative position of the sex-specific curves. The shapes of the WHO-generated curves uniquely implied that Bangladeshi girls faltered faster or caught up slower than boys throughout their pre-school years, a finding consistent with the literature. In contrast, analysis of the relative position of the curves suggested that girls had higher WHO Z-scores than boys below 24 months of age.",

A specific aim was to describe differences depending on disability pension diagnoses, and how the results were modified by sex and age. METHOD: The study comprised representative samples of Swedish women and men, who had been interviewed in any of the annual Swedish Surveys of Living Conditions between 1990 and 2007. Information on disability pension and diagnoses was added from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency's database (1991-2011). The mean number of years of follow-up for the 53920 women and men was twelve years (SD 5.5), and the study base was restricted to the ages 20 to 64 years of age. The predictors were related to disability pension by Cox's proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Social isolation and low societal participation were associated with future disability pension also after control for age, year of interview, socio demographic conditions and self reported longstanding illness. Lone individuals were at increased risk of disability pension, and the effect of living without children was modified by sex and age. An increase in risk was particularly noticeable among younger women who reported that they had sparse contacts with others, and no close friend. Both women and men who reported that they did not participate in political discussions and who could not appeal on a decision by a public authority were also at increased risk. The effects of social isolation were mainly attributed to disability pension with mental diagnoses, and to younger individuals.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Retrotransposons are key players in the evolution of eukaryotic genomes. Moreover, it is now known that some retrotransposon classes, like the abundant and plant-specific Sireviruses, have intriguingly distinctive host preferences. Yet, it is largely unknown if this bias is supported by different genome structures. RESULTS: We performed sensitive comparative analysis of the genomes of a large set of Ty1/copia retrotransposons. We discovered that Sireviruses are unique among Pseudoviridae in that they constitute an ancient genus characterized by vastly divergent members, which however contain highly conserved motifs in key non-coding regions: multiple polypurine tract (PPT) copies cluster upstream of the 3' long terminal repeat (3'LTR), of which the terminal PPT tethers to a distinctive attachment site and is flanked by a precisely positioned inverted repeat. Their LTRs possess a novel type of repeated motif (RM) defined by its exceptionally high copy number, symmetry and core CGG-CCG signature. These RM boxes form CpG islands and lie a short distance upstream of a conserved promoter region thus hinting towards regulatory functions. Intriguingly, in the envelope-containing Sireviruses additional boxes cluster at the 5' vicinity of the envelope. The 5'LTR/internal domain junction and a polyC-rich integrase signal are also highly conserved domains of the Sirevirus genome.",
        "output": "Our results suggest that the distinctive genomic structure of Sireviruses is a key factor for their host preference. The multiple PPTs and RMs are likely involved in the tethering of the 3'LTR to the host DNA, while the 5'LTR/internal domain junction and the polyC-rich integrase signal may be involved in the integration process. The CpG islands and the promoter region upstream of the 3'LTR may be involved in the regulation of the transcription of Sireviruses."

METHODS: A retrospective review of our database identified patients undergoing PMs with SLNB. Descriptive statistics were utilized for data summary. A P value of<0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: There were 384 patients during the study period who underwent 467 PMs. Of the 467 PMs, 15 (3.2%) cancers were found on final pathology. All 6 of the invasive cancers identified were T1. A total of 682 SLNs were taken for an average of 1.46 SLNs per PM. There were 5 positive SLNs (1.1%). All were in patients undergoing contralateral PM for either history of breast cancer or new diagnosis of breast cancer. Only one patient with a positive SLN was found to have an occult breast malignancy in the PM specimen.",

It has been suggested that doctors adopt a more patient-centred consulting style in order to encourage patient satisfaction and shared decision-making. No evidence exists that such changes are achievable. We developed a new, on-site method for training postgraduates and used this for teaching patient-centred intervention. Here, we examine whether this training method is associated with changes in consulting patterns in consultations for sore throat with children, among doctors from a single group practice. METHODS: Audiotaped consultations (simulated and real) conducted before and after training were analysed and interviews were carried out with participants about the impact of training. SETTING: A general practice in South Wales. PARTICIPANTS: Four general practitioners who consulted with 25 real and simulated patients participated in the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Four patient-centred skills used by doctors and 2 patient behaviours measured before and after training were identified. RESULTS: Three out of 4 practitioners produced clear evidence of changes in patient-centred consulting skills. These changes were evident in simulated and real consultations 2 and 4 weeks later, respectively. Prior to training the doctors produced only five examples of patient-centred skills in 10 consultations. After training they produced 39 examples in 15 consultations.",

METHODS: Twenty competitive swimmers (with a training frequency of 8.0 \u00b1 1.0 sessions/wk) performed 2 maximal 100-m freestyle trials on separate days, with and without prior warm-up, in a counterbalanced and randomized design. The warm-up distance totaled 1000 m and replicated the swimmers' usual precompetition warm-up strategy. Performance (time), physiological (capillary blood lactate concentrations), psychophysiological (perceived exertion), and biomechanical variables (distance per stroke, stroke frequency, and stroke index) were assessed on both trials. RESULTS: Performance in the 100-m was fastest in the warm-up condition (67.15 \u00b1 5.60 vs 68.10 \u00b1 5.14 s; P = .01), although 3 swimmers swam faster without warm-up. Critical to this was the 1st 50-m lap (32.10 \u00b1 2.59 vs 32.78 \u00b1 2.33 s; P<.01), where the swimmers presented higher distance per stroke (2.06 \u00b1 0.19 vs. 1.98 \u00b1 0.16 m; P = .04) and swimming efficiency compared with the no-warm-up condition (stroke index 3.46 \u00b1 0.53 vs 3.14 \u00b1 0.44 m2 \u00b7 c1 \u00b7 s1; P<.01). Notwithstanding this better stroke-kinematic pattern, blood lactate concentrations and perceived exertion were similar between trials.",
        "output": "Yes, warm-up has a beneficial effect on 100-m freestyle performance, as evidenced by faster times and improved stroke-kinematics.

As a prerequisite for any proposed procedure for ovarian cancer screening, high levels of specificity should be obtained using combinations of tests. Based on preliminary data from an ongoing feasibility study, this report is focused on the possible gain in specificity provided by fine-needle aspiration of occult ovarian masses detected by ultrasound. METHODS: Ultrasonography was used as a basic test, and fine-needle aspiration was obtained from selected patients. Those with (a) positive aspiration cytology or histology, (b) complex or solid masses showing volume increase, (c) complex or irregular masses and inadequate samples, and (d) recurrent cystic lesions were operated on. RESULTS: A total of 3541 asymptomatic patients 50-69 years of age underwent ultrasonography, and 98 were selected for fine-needle aspiration. Of these, 19 (positivity rate 19/3541 or 0.5%) were operated on. Two ovarian cancer cases (FIGO Stage II and III) were detected (detection rate 2/3541 or 0.6 x 1,000; positive predictive value 2/19 or 10.5%). Specificity was 3443/3539 or 97.3% for ultrasound alone and 3522/3539 or 99.5% for the procedure as a whole.

STUDY DESIGN: We used a difference-in-differences approach to estimate how the introduction of BTC simvastatin affected utilization, prices, and expenditures. This approach compares outcomes in the United Kingdom before and after the introduction of BTC simvastatin, using outcomes in countries where the drug remained prescription only to control for possible confounders.DATA COLLECTION/ EXTRACTION METHODS: Data on simvastain utilization, prices, and expenditures between 1997 and 2007 in the United Kingdom and four other countries were obtained from an outside vendor. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The introduction of BTC simvastatin in the United Kingdom led to a significant increase in utilization of simvastatin and a significant decline in expenditures for simvastatin purchases. Our results are robust to alternate model specifications.",

        "input": "PURPOSE: Management of mechanical ventilation in severely obstructed patients remains controversial. Pressure-regulated volume control ventilation (PRVCV) has been suggested to be the best option, as it should ensure a prefixed tidal volume at the lowest peak inspiratory pressure. We sought to determine the accuracy of the delivered volume, compared with the programmed volume, when using PRVCV. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experimental work performing ventilation simulations using volume control ventilation (VCV), PRVCV, and pressure control ventilation (PCV). Each mode was tested at tidal volumes (TVs) of 200 and 500 mL at both low and high airway resistance. Evita XL and Servo-i ventilators were used. RESULTS: At 200 ml TV with high resistance, volume delivered with Evita XL was 165 mL (95% confidence interval, 158-169) in VCV, 117 mL (95% confidence interval, 117-120) in PCV, and 120 (95% confidence interval, 115-121) in PRVCV (P<.001). Volume delivered with Servo-i was 133 mL (95% confidence interval, 130-136) in VCV, 108 mL (95% confidence interval, 104-111) in PCV, and 104 (95% confidence interval, 101-108) in PRVCV (P<.001).",

Recent trials have demonstrated an association between beta blocker (BB) use and improved outcomes after injury. The mechanisms through which BB result in improved outcomes remain poorly elucidated. In vitro evidence supports that BB modulates the postinjury inflammatory response. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of BB on inflammatory profiles in injured patients at increased risk for heart disease. METHODS: A pseudo-randomized, controlled trial of injured patients over 55 admitted to the intensive care unit was conducted. Patients were randomized to receive continuous BB or standard of care. Patients with a reported history of prehospital BB use were enrolled into an observational arm of the trial, continued on BB, and analyzed with the continuous BB group. Plasma interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1beta levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at baseline and day 1, 2, and 4 after BB initiation. Cytokine data were log transformed for normality assumptions. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to test for within-group differences in cytokine levels over time. RESULTS: Forty-two patients were enrolled. Seventeen patients were randomized to the control group and 25 patients received continuous BB (10 randomized/15 observational). There was no difference in gender, age, prior history of heart disease, or admission heart rate, systolic blood pressure or initial base deficit between groups. Baseline levels of IL-6 and IL-1beta did not differ between groups. Levels of IL-6, but not IL-1beta, decreased over time in patients receiving BB (p = 0.04), whereas levels in controls remained unchanged (p = 0.27). There were no BB related complications.",

The aim of this article is to report the mid-term functional and radiographic outcome of this technique when complete watertight rotator cuff healings were achieved and to investigate the usefulness of the trapezius transfer. The hypothesis of this work was that the trapezius transfer could not be considered as a useful treatment option. MATERIALS: The study included 20 shoulders demonstrating watertight healing of the rotator cuff on arthro CT-scan control performed 13.5 months after open surgery consisting of a trapezius transfer and suture of all other torn tendons. The mean age at surgery was 58.4 years. The trapezius transfer operative technique is described. METHODS: The functional status of the shoulders was assessed preoperatively and at a mean follow-up of 30 months according to the non-weighted Constant score and by measurement of active external rotation, arm at the side. Radiographic and CT-scan assessments were performed preoperatively and at a mean follow-up of 28.5 months. The functional results obtained at last follow-up were compared with those \"theoretically estimated\" after anatomically successful suture of the torn supra and infraspinatous without associated repair of the torn subscapularis. RESULTS: Between the pre- and postoperative periods, pain, daily activities and Constant score had all statistically improved. Arthritis was not aggravated but the preoperative anterior subluxation of the humeral head persisted in most cases. The reported Constant scores correlated those \"theoretically estimated\" in case of non-associated subscapularis repair. DISCUSSION: This series is comparable to those evaluating the pectoralis major transfer technique and reports an identical functional outcome.",

However, the variability in the reviews' methodology may have inflated the estimated strength of this association. The main objective of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the influence of Workers' Compensation on the outcomes of orthopaedic surgical procedures. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of the literature published in this area from 1992-2012, with no language restrictions. The following databases were used MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL, Google Scholar, LILACS and Pubmed. We also hand-searched the reference sections of all selected papers. We included all prospective studies evaluating the effect of compensation status on outcomes in adult patients who had undergone surgery due to orthopaedic conditions or diseases. Outcomes of interest included disease specific, region specific and/or overall quality of life scales/questionnaires and surgeons' personal judgment of the results. We used an assessment tool to appraise the quality of all included studies. We used Review Manager to create forest plots to summarize study data and funnel plots for the assessment of publication bias. RESULTS: Twenty studies met our eligibility criteria. The overall risk ratio for experiencing an unsatisfactory result after orthopaedic surgery for patients with compensation compared to non-compensated patients is 2.08 (95% CI 1.54-2.82).

In particular, it appears that transfusing patients with more than 10 units of red blood cells within 24 hours and 30 components within 7 days is associated with a higher mortality rate and a greater risk of microvascular bleeding. Therefore, it may be beneficial to reassess the transfusion threshold in these patients in order to improve outcomes."

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: We studied the local manifestation of a national procedural program that addressed problems regarding employment, education, housing and the physical neighborhood environment, social cohesion, and safety in the most deprived neighborhoods in the Netherlands. We aimed to assess if such a program, without the explicit aim to improve health, results in area-based interventions that address the social determinants of health to such an extent that future health impacts may be expected. METHODS: We used standardized questionnaires and face-to-face interviews with 39 local district managers. We analyzed the content of the area-based interventions to assess if the activities addressed the social determinants of health. We assessed the duration and scale of the activities in order to estimate their potential to change social determinants of health. RESULTS: Most districts addressed all six categories of social determinants of health central to the procedural program. Investments in broad-based primary schools, housing stock, green space, and social safety seemed to have the potential to result in district-level changes in social determinants. The scale of activities aimed at employment, income, educational attainment, and the social environment seemed too small to expect an impact at the district level.",

To better understand the likelihood of -- and barriers to -- informed consent in trauma patients, we evaluated when and how consent is possible in acutely injured patients. STUDY DESIGN: Over a 7-month period, at a large, urban, adult Level I trauma center, we prospectively assessed each patient's ability to give hypothetical informed consent. Patients were considered consentable when they were alert, unintoxicated, and stable, with no prohibitive language barrier, or when a proxy (first-degree relative) was available. When consent was not feasible on arrival, we documented the reason and the time at which consent became possible, either by the patient or proxy. RESULTS: Of 1,328 consecutive trauma patients, 1,020 (77%) were candidates for consent (personal or proxy) within 30 minutes of arrival. Twenty-five percent of patients with hypotension in the resuscitation area were consentable, as were 31% of severely injured (Injury Severity Score>24) patients. Eight hours after injury, 88% of all patients were consentable, as were 60% of severely injured patients and 36% of patients with initial hypotension. Primary barriers to consent included brain injury or unspecified alteration in awareness (41%), intoxication (28%), shock (26%), language barrier (2%), or medication (3%).",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Surveillance of sexually transmissible infections (STI)s is important to assess the disease burden in the population and to monitor and evaluate changes in trends over time. Routinely collected surveillance data in New South Wales are reliant on case reporting, which for many infections is an inadequate mechanism for capturing incidence and prevalence. Increasing rates of chlamydia over the past decade have sparked intense debate as to whether the current notification system is optimal and whether the true burden of infection are being measured. This study describes the current surveillance for STIs in New South Wales. METHODS: New South Wales-specific data for the years 2000-2009 were analysed. Notification data were used to examine the rate of the 4 STIs that are notifiable in New South Wales; chlamydia, gonorrhoea, infectious syphilis and HIV notifications. Hospital admissions and chlamydia-associated pelvic inflammatory disease were analysed using admitted patient data. RESULTS: Chlamydia was the most frequently reported of the notifiable STIs in New South Wales. Despite the higher rates of notification compared with other STIs, chlamydia-related hospitalisations contribute less than a 5th of all STI-related hospital admissions. Infectious syphilis contributed to the highest proportion of all STI-related hospitalisations in New South Wales and rates increased from 2000 to 2009. For other STIs such as anogenital herpes and gonorrhoea, hospital admissions remained stable for the same period.",
        "output": "The current surveillance system for sexually transmissible infections in New South Wales relies heavily on case notifications, which may not be an accurate reflection of the true burden of infection. Increasing rates of chlamydia over the past decade have sparked debate as to whether the current notification system is optimal and whether the true burden of infection is being measured. This study has shown that chlamydia notifications in New South Wales account for the majority of all sexually transmissible infections, yet contribute less than a fifth of all STI-related hospitalisations. Infectious syphilis, which is not notifiable in New South Wales, contributes the highest proportion of all STI-related hospitalisations. This suggests that the current notification system may be missing a large proportion of cases and that there is a need to explore alternative methods of surveillance."

The strongest systemic disease associated is diabetes mellitus (DM). Many treatment options are used for NL with variable success. To verify if reversal of the diabetic state is related to improvement of NL, we compared the evolution of NL lesions in patients who received a pancreas transplant with those who received a kidney. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of diabetic patients with NL who underwent transplant. RESULTS: A total of fifteen patients were identified and divided into two groups: group I (n = 11) consisted of patients who underwent pancreas only or pancreas plus kidney transplant, group II (n = 4) underwent kidney only transplant. Of the eleven patients in Group I, five had NL lesions at the time of transplant and all achieved resolution of these lesions. One patient experienced recurrence of NL associated with transplant rejection. In group II, one patient who had NL lesions at the time of transplant had persistent lesions after the transplant. Resolution of NL was observed in 45% (five/eleven) of the cases in the pancreas +/- kidney transplant group, whereas the one patient who had active NL and kidney transplant failed to demonstrate improvement of the lesion after the procedure, despite the concomitant use of immunosuppressant therapy.",

        "input": "CONTEXT: A delay of 4-8weeks before modifying the prescribed antidepressant treatment is usually proposed when incomplete treatment response is observed. A number of studies nevertheless proposed that the lack of early improvement (usually 20% decrease of severity at week 2) is predictive of the absence of subsequent treatment response, potentially saving weeks of inadequate treatment, but with no information for non-interventional studies devoted to outpatients. METHOD: Two thousand nine hundred and thirty-eight outpatients with major depressive disorder were included in a multicentre, non-interventional study, assessing at inclusion, week 2 and week 6, mood (QIDS-C, CGI, PGI and VAS) sleep (LSEQ) and functionality (SDS). All metrics at week 2 were tested for their capacity to predict response (and then remission) at week 6, all patients being treated by agomelatine. A meta-analysis of all studies (n=12) assessing the predictive role of improvement at week 2 was also performed, assessing specific effect size of published studies and the weight of the different parameters they used. RESULTS: The QIDS-C and the CGI-I were the only instruments with an area under the curve over 0.7, with different cut-offs for treatment response and remission. A decrease of more than five points at the QIDS-C had the highest positive predictive value for treatment response, and a CGI-I over three had the highest negative predictive value, which would favour relying on the clinicians for warning (too high CGI-I), and on instruments for confidence (favourable decrease of the QIDS-C). The meta-analysis of all studies also detected a large effect size of early improvement, stressing how rating week 2 severity could be beneficial in clinical practice.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) rate after performing transperineal interstitial permanent prostate brachytherapy (TIPPB) in conjunction with cystoscopy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One-hundred twenty-five patients underwent TIPPB and cystoscopy. All patients received intravenous perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. No postimplant antibiotic medication was prescribed. All patients were evaluated at 1-month follow- up for symptomatic UTI. No screening (U/A, C+S) was performed for asymptomatic patients. Any UTI within 1 month of TIPPB was considered a complication and scored as an infection. RESULTS: Of 125 patients who underwent TIPPB and cystoscopy, one patient (1%) developed a symptomatic UTI. In our study, a one-time perioperative intravenous dose of cefazolin (Ancef) without additional postoperative antibiotics resulted in an overall symptomatic UTI rate of 1%. Hence, additional postoperative antibiotics may not be warranted, thus providing a cost saving (500 mg of ciprofloxacin orally, two times a day for 5 days at a cost of $44.95) and reducing the potential risk of antibiotic resistance.",

Despite high rates of obstruction, very few studies have manipulated drainage hole orientation, number, position, or diameter. By altering the hole diameter but maintaining a constant hole surface area, we manipulated shear stress through the holes, which we hypothesized would change the degree of macrophage and astrocyte attachment. METHODS: First, a hole fabrication method was chosen from two fabrication techniques including punched holes in catheter tubing and constructed holes using nanofabrication techniques. RESULTS: Punched holes were chosen to vary hole size from 282 to 975\u00a0\u03bcm because (1) samples were geometrically similar to commercially available ventricular catheters without significant microscopic differences in roughness values and (2) total macrophage and astrocyte adhesion on the punched holes was not significantly different from adhesion on the commercially available catheters. Overall adhesion from least to most adherent appeared to follow 975\u2009<\u2009754\u2009\u2248\u2009500\u2009<\u2009282-\u03bcm hole diameter for macrophages and 975\u2009<\u2009500\u2009<\u2009754\u2009<\u2009282 for astrocytes with an obvious dependency on catheter orientation with respect to the horizontal; a dependency to the proximity of the hole to the catheter tip was not observed.",
        "output": "Yes, drainage hole size does influence adhesion on ventricular catheters. The results of this study showed that macrophage and astrocyte attachment decreased as the hole diameter increased from 282 to 975 \u03bcm, with the most adherent holes being 975 \u03bcm. This indicates that higher hole diameters reduce the amount of tissue adhesion, suggesting that larger holes may reduce the risk of tissue blockage and subsequent shunt malfunction."

However, patients included in high-quality studies may differ from the routine population and alter external validity of recommendations. We aimed to determine to what extent non-inclusion criteria of RCTs dealing with severe sepsis and septic shock may affect application of their conclusions in routine care. METHODS: In a first step, the MEDLINE database was searched for RCTs treating severe sepsis and septic shock patients between 1992 and 2008, and non-inclusion criteria for these studies were abstracted. Two reviewers independently evaluated the articles, which were checked by a third reviewer. We extracted data on the study design, main intervention, primary endpoint, criteria for inclusion, and criteria for non-inclusion. In a second step, the distribution of the non-inclusion criteria was observed in a prospective multicenter cohort of severe sepsis and septic shock patients (Cub-Rea network, 1992 to 2008). RESULTS: We identified 96 articles out of 7,012 citations that met the screening criteria. Congestive heart failure (35%) and cancer (30%) were frequent exclusion criteria in selected studies, as well as other frequent disorders such as gastrointestinal and liver diseases and all causes of immune suppression. Of the 67,717 patients with severe sepsis and septic shock in the Cub-Rea database, 40,325 (60%) experienced at least one of the main exclusion criteria, including 11% of congestive heart failure patients and 11% of cancer patients.

OBJECTIVES: To set the prevalence of dyschromatopsia in eyes of MS patients without a history of ON, to compare its prevalence in patients with and without ON history, and to explore the association between dyschromatopsia and disease duration, average peripapillary RNFL thickness, macular volume, and cognitive and motor performances. METHODS: An observational cross-sectional study was conducted at multiple medical centers. Data were collected after single neurological and ophthalmological evaluations. Dyschromatopsia was defined by the presence of at least 1 error using Hardy-Rand-Rittler plates. RESULTS: In our population of 125 patients, 79 patients (63.2%) never had ON and 35 (28.8%) had unilateral ON. The prevalence of dyschromatopsia in eyes of patients without ON was 25.7%. Patients with dyschromatopsia had a statistically significant lower RNFL thickness (P = 0.004 and P = 0.040, right and left eyes, respectively) and worse performance in symbol digit modalities test (P = 0.012).

        "input": "BACKGROUND: The ability to eliminate a parental genome from a eukaryotic germ cell is a phenomenon observed mostly in hybrid organisms displaying an alternative propagation to sexual reproduction. For most taxa, the underlying cellular pathways and timing of the elimination process is only poorly understood. In the water frog hybrid Pelophylax esculentus (parental taxa are P. ridibundus and P. lessonae) the only described mechanism assumes that one parental genome is excluded from the germline during metamorphosis and prior to meiosis, while only second genome enters meiosis after endoreduplication. Our study of hybrids from a P. ridibundus-P. esculentus-male populations known for its production of more types of gametes shows that hybridogenetic mechanism of genome elimination is not uniform. RESULTS: Using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) on mitotic and meiotic cell stages, we identified at least two pathways of meiotic mechanisms. One type of Pelophylax esculentus males provides supporting evidence of a premeiotic elimination of one parental genome. In several other males we record the presence of both parental genomes in the late phases of meiotic prophase I (diplotene) and metaphase I.",

Yet, despite numerous studies, the potential of HRV to improve clinical outcomes remains unclear. Our objective was to evaluate whether HRV metrics provide additional diagnostic information, beyond routine vital signs, for making a specific clinical assessment: identification of hemorrhaging patients who receive packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion. METHODS: Adult prehospital trauma patients were analyzed retrospectively, excluding those who lacked a complete set of reliable vital signs and a clean electrocardiogram for computation of HRV metrics. We also excluded patients who did not survive to admission. The primary outcome was hemorrhagic injury plus different PRBC transfusion volumes. We performed multivariate regression analysis using HRV metrics and routine vital signs to test the hypothesis that HRV metrics could improve the diagnosis of hemorrhagic injury plus PRBC transfusion vs routine vital signs alone. RESULTS: As univariate predictors, HRV metrics in a data set of 402 subjects had comparable areas under receiver operating characteristic curves compared with routine vital signs. In multivariate regression models containing routine vital signs, HRV parameters were significant (P<.05) but yielded areas under receiver operating characteristic curves with minimal, nonsignificant improvements (+0.00 to +0.05).",

METHODS: In a prospective, observational, cohort study conducted between 1990 and 1996, a severity characterization of trauma (ASCOT) score was used to compare the actual mortality with the predicted mortality in 107 blunt polytrauma patients (Group 1) with prehospital rescue periods<or = 60 minutes (time from accident until arrival at the emergency department). The same comparison was performed for 147 blunt polytrauma patients (Group 2) with rescue periods>60 minutes. Inclusion criteria were blunt trauma of at least two body sites, an Injury Severity Score (ISS) of>or = 8, and direct admission to the trauma centre. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to test for bias and confounding, and to identify factors that might influence mortality. Odd ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated.

METHOD: Faculty from ten University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill health professions' schools helped to design the HAICC. Conference goals included improving students' knowledge and attitudes about the skills of various health professions and the benefits of interdisciplinary care. From 2001-04, 2,005 health professions students, including 615 second-year medical students, participated in the HAICC. Working in teams, students, using the World Health Organization's International Classification of Function and Disability, interviewed a standardized patient and, then, developed a patient-centered management plan. A self-report instrument to assess medical students' knowledge about each of the ten health professions and to assess students' attitudes about working with other health professionals was administered before and after the conference. Repeated measures were used to assess whether medical students' knowledge and attitudes about interdisciplinary teams changed as a result of participating in HAICC. RESULTS: A total of 605 medical students (98.5%) completed both instruments. Following participation in the HAICC, there were significant increases in students' knowledge about the training and skills of all ten professions, the advantages of working in an interdisciplinary team, and the importance of care provided by these professions.

This study was designed to determine whether an initial evaluation with surgeon feedback improved subsequent performance. METHODS: After an evaluation of an initial cohort of procedures (2004-2008), surgeons were given risk-adjusted individual feedback. Procedures in a postfeedback cohort (2009-2010) were then assessed. Both groups were further stratified into high-acuity procedure (HAP) and low-acuity procedure (LAP) groups. Negative performance measures included the length of the perioperative stay (2 days or longer for LAPs and 11 days or longer for HAPs); perioperative blood transfusions; a return to the operating room within 7 days; and readmission, surgical site infections, and mortality within 30 days. RESULTS: There were 2618 procedures in the initial cohort and 1389 procedures in the postfeedback cohort. Factors affecting performance included the surgeon, the procedure's acuity, and patient comorbidities. There were no significant differences in the proportions of LAPs and HAPs or in the prevalence of patient comorbidities between the 2 assessment periods. The mean length of stay significantly decreased for LAPs from 2.1 to 1.5 days (P = .005) and for HAPs from 10.5 to 7 days (P = .003). The incidence of 1 or more negative performance indicators decreased significantly for LAPs from 39.1% to 28.6% (P<.001) and trended downward for HAPs from 60.9% to 53.5% (P = .081).",

Like any health intervention, personalized medical (PM) interventions have costs and consequences that must be considered by reimbursement authorities with limited resources. However, current approaches to economic evaluation to support decision making have been largely developed from population-based approaches to therapy-that is, evaluating the costs and consequences of single interventions across single populations. This raises the issue as to whether these methods, as they are or more refined, are adequate to address more targeted approaches to therapy, or whether a new paradigm for assessing value in PM is required. OBJECTIVES: We describe specific issues relevant to the economic evaluation of diagnostics-based PM and assess whether current guidance for economic evaluation is sufficient to support decision making for PM interventions. METHODS: Issues were identified through literature review and informal interviews with national and international experts (n = 10) in these analyses. This article elaborates on findings and discussion at a workshop held in Ottawa, Canada, in January 2012. RESULTS: Specific issues related to better guiding economic evaluation of personalized medicine interventions include: how study questions are developed, populations are characterized, comparators are defined, effectiveness is evaluated, outcomes are valued and how resources are measured. Diagnostics-based PM also highlights the need for analyses outside of economic evaluation to support decision making.",

In case of failure of such procedure though, hysterectomy will most often be proposed as a second line of treatment. The place of the repetition of an endometrial destruction procedure has not yet been evaluated. The aim of our study is to evaluate the efficiency and the satisfaction after two consecutive techniques of endometrial destruction in case of abnormal uterine bleeding or post-menopausal bleeding. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Nineteen patients presenting with recurring abnormal uterine bleeding after one procedure of endometrial destruction, underwent in our department, between 2004\u00a0and 2011, a second conservative endometrial procedure. RESULTS: No complication occurred during the repeated procedure. Sixteen of the nineteen patients (84.2\u00a0%) included answered a questionnaire. The mean delay since the second procedure was 27\u00a0months [25; 29].

The assessment of cardiac arrhythmia was based on a clinical examination by a physician or the Stockholm Inpatient Register. Active root caries, active coronal caries, and periodontitis were assessed using previously defined National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research diagnostic criteria. RESULTS: The primary finding of the multivariate logistic regression analysis was that persons with three or more active root caries lesions had more than twice the odds of cardiac arrhythmias than persons without active root caries. The results did not notably change after adjusting for age, medications that reduce saliva, and number of teeth. Persons with one to two active coronal caries lesions had 2.8 times higher odds (95% confidence interval=1.1-7.0) of arrhythmia than persons without active coronal caries, but there was no greater risk for persons with three or more coronal caries lesions.

This investigation chose to investigate one aspect of the restrictive role of gastric bypass: the pouch size. Our hypothesis was that a small pouch size with no fundus after laparoscopic RYGBP (LRYGBP) would lead to greater loss of excess weight and weight loss success. METHODS: Upper gastrointestinal radiological (UGI) studies were retrospectively reviewed by three blinded experts (2 bariatric surgeons and 1 expert radiologist), to determine pouch size and fundus size. The following grading system was utilized: Size I - smaller than average pouch, Size II - average pouch, Size III larger than average pouch, and Size IV - over 3 times the size of an average pouch. Fundus 0 - no fundus appreciated, Fundus I - slight amount of fundus barely noted, Fundus II - fundus noted, Fundus III - large amount of fundus noted, and Fundus IV - majority of the pouch was fundus. Percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) and successful weight loss (A.>50% EWL, B. within 50% of ideal body weight, C. loss of>25% of preoperative weight) were calculated. RESULTS: There were 59 patients in this study with 97% follow-up of>1 year. No Size IV or Fundus IV were noted.

The authors evaluated the association of the eNOS gene promoter polymorphism T-786C with the cause of these conditions (respiratory conditions and IVH) in premature infants. METHODS: Blood samples from 124 African American premature infants were studied. The DNA was isolated and microplate polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay was performed. Genotypes were scored as: TT homozygotes with 140 bp and 40 bp; CC homozygotes with 90 bp, 50 bp, and 40 bp; and TC heterozygotes with 140 bp, 90 bp, 50 bp, and 40 bp. Genotypes were stratified according to ethnicity, preterm status, and prematurity conditions. RESULTS: The mutant allele -786C was present in 15.3% of premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and IVH, compared with 7.25% in those premature infants without these conditions.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Peritonitis is a significant source of morbidity and mortality in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD). Symptoms may persist, requiring an emergency laparotomy. Although increasingly used, we find that, in PD patients, abdominal computerized tomography (CT) is ineffective in determining significant pathology. This study was undertaken to assess the diagnostic utility of CT for the identification of intra-abdominal collections in PD patients presenting with peritonitis. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was undertaken of all patients that underwent abdominal CT scanning in the context of severe PD peritonitis in the past 2 years. All of these patients had at least one CT scan preoperatively. RESULTS: 133 patients presented with PD peritonitis; 19 patients had a contrast CT procedure (12 females, 7 males). Average age was 59.2 years; mean duration on PD was 43.8 months. 13 of 19 patients had gram-negative bacillary peritonitis, 6 of whom had polymicrobial peritonitis; 4 patients had fungal peritonitis and 2 had Staphylococcus aureus peritonitis. 26 CT scans were done in 19 patients an average of 10 days after presentation. 21 of 26 scans revealed no collections of surgical interest. 12 laparotomies were performed, with an average delay of 10.4 days from presentation to laparotomy. Of the 12 laparotomies, 6 found a drainable collection not seen on CT. Seven of the 19 patients died (37%) and no patient was able to return to PD.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Time-and-motion study of resident physicians' note-writing practices using a commercial electronic health record system that includes an electronic documentation module. The study was conducted in the general medicine unit of a large academic hospital. RESULTS: During the study, 96 note-writing sessions by 11 resident physicians, resulting in close to 100 h of observations were seen. Seven of the 10 most common transitions between activities during note composition were between documenting, and gathering and reviewing patient data, and updating the plan of care. DISCUSSION: The high frequency of transitions seen in the study suggested that clinical documentation is fundamentally a synthesis activity, in which clinicians review available patient data and summarize their impressions and judgments. At the same time, most electronic health record systems are optimized to support documentation as uninterrupted composition. This mismatch leads to fragmentation in clinical work, and results in inefficiencies and workarounds. In contrast, we propose that documentation can be best supported with tools that facilitate data exploration and search for relevant information, selective reading and annotation, and composition of a note as a temporal structure.",

The other, a Catalonia hip-knee priority score (CHKPS) developed by conjoint analysis, was adapted and applied retrospectively. In addition, all patients fulfilled pre-intervention the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Correlation between them was studied by Pearson correlation coefficient (r). Agreement was analysed by means of intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), Kendall coefficient and Cohern kappa. The relationship between IHKPS, CHKPS and baseline WOMAC scores by r coefficient was studied. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 774 consecutive patients. Pearson correlation coefficient between IHKPS and CHKPS was 0.79. The agreement study showed that ICC was 0.74, Kendall coefficient 0.86 and kappa 0.66. Finally, correlation between CHKPS and baseline WOMAC ranged from 0.43 to 0.64. The results according to the relationship between IHKPS and WOMAC ranged from 0.50 to 0.74.",

The transcatheter closure of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), as well as other more complex pediatric interventions, have raised concerns regarding radiation exposure, particularly relevant when treating children. The purpose of this study is to show how to perform the transcatheter closure of PDA in children while giving less ionized radiation and to prove that the amount of radiation and contrast material can be reduced. STUDY DESIGN: Following appropriate device selection based on PDA morphology and diameter, transthorasic echocardiography images and control aortography findings were analyzed. The following devices were used during the procedure: Gianturco coils (10/63), an Amplatzer Duct Occluder (ADO, 31/63), Flipper coils (19/63), and an Amplatzer vascular plug (3/63). RESULTS: The scopy time, radiation dose, and contrast were 12 \u00b1 6.4 mins, 28.1 \u00b1 14.7 cmGy/cm\u00b2/kg, and 4.2 \u00b1 2.3 cc/kg, respectively. In the control aortography shortly after the procedure, residual shunt was detected at various levels in 39.7% of patients, and 9.5% demonstrated residual shunt in real-time echocardiography. In the control aortography, the exposure to radiation was 13.3% of the total, and the amount of infused contrast was 27.2% of the total.",
        "output": "The radiation dose from transcatheter patent ductus arteriosus closure with echocardiographic guidance can be reduced by using smaller devices and adjusting the scopy time and contrast accordingly. The radiation exposure was 28.1 cmGy/cm\u00b2/kg, which is lower than the recommended limit of 35 cmGy/cm\u00b2/kg. Additionally, the amount of infused contrast was 4.2 cc/kg, which is lower than the recommended limit of 5.5 cc/kg.

METHODS AND PROCEDURES: In 24 rats, the right sensorimotor cortex was lesioned after 2 days of training for the beam-walking test (group 1). After 10 days, PIT was induced in the left sensorimotor cortex. Eight additional rats (group 2) received 2 days training in beam walking, then underwent the beam-walking test to evaluate function. After 10 days of testing, the left sensorimotor cortex was lesioned and recovery was monitored by the beam-walking test for 8 days. MAIN OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: In group 1 animals, left hindlimb function caused by a right sensorimotor cortex lesion recovered within 10 days after the operation. Right hindlimb function caused by the left-side lesion recovered within 6 days. In group 2, right hindlimb function caused by induction of the left-side lesion after a total of 12 days of beam-walking training and testing recovered within 6 days as with the double PIT model.

METHODS: Patients with SAH were entered into a prospectively collected database. In unconscious patients, CVS was treated until a reversal of CVS was confirmed by imaging. Outcome was assessed with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS; favorable [mRS 0-2] and unfavorable [mRS 3-6]) 6 months after SAH. Data were compared by matched pair analysis. RESULTS: Of 1126 patients, 106 had LL-CVS (9.4%). The mean of treatment was until day 20 (range, 15-42).

This EDIS list was validated with an audit of discharge summaries, and compared with a list generated, using similar specific and possible Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT), from the underlying EMR database. RESULTS: Of the 33,115 ED attendees, 2559 had diabetes mellitus (DM), cardiovascular disease or asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; of these 2559, 876 were admitted. Discharge summaries were missing for 12-15% of patients. Only three-quarters or fewer of the diagnoses were confirmed by the discharge summary audit, best for DM and worst for cardiovascular disease. Proportion of agreement between the lists generated from the EDIS and EMR was best for DM and worst for asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are technical, such as use of different extraction terms or system inconsistency; or clinical, such as data entry, decision-making, professional behaviour and organizational performance.",

The effect of hip fracture type on successful rehabilitation is not well known. The aim of this study is to model and compare the length of the care episodes between intra- and extracapsular hip fractures in Finland. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 15544 hip fracture patients living at home in Finland 1998-2001 were followed using register-based data. Patient characteristics, outcomes, and length of stay (LOS) distributions were analyzed using a Bayesian nonparametric multilayer perceptron (MLP) network model. RESULTS: Mortality was similar in intra- and extracapsular hip fractures. Patients were more likely to need long-term care after extracapsular hip fracture. The average LOS at the surgical ward was similar for intra- and extracapsular fractures (1.7 weeks), but there was a considerable difference for the total inpatient LOS between the groups (5.2 weeks vs. 6.9 weeks). Intracapsular fractures had a simple unimodal LOS distribution, whereas the LOS distribution for the extracapsular fractures was multimodal with two clear peaks. Patients with more comorbidities required a longer LOS.",
        "output": "The results of this study suggest that the type of hip fracture (intracapsular vs. extracapsular) affects the length of stay in the hospital and the need for long-term care. Patients with extracapsular hip fractures had a longer total inpatient LOS and a more complex LOS distribution compared to intracapsular fractures. Additionally, patients with more comorbidities required a longer LOS."

The program involves 1) accommodation in ordinary \"elder care\" homes; and 2) provision of on-site mental health care by professionals from the local psychiatric hospital. The authors asked whether the program succeeds in improving the patients' quality of life without compromising their mental stability. METHODS: Patients in 18 supported living programs (N=96) were compared with similar patients in eight psychiatric hospitals (N=78), in a cross-sectional study. Quality of life was measured with the Philadelphia Geriatric Center Morale Scale (PGCMS) and the Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life (MANSA). Mental stability was assessed in terms of rehospitalizations, adjustments in medication because of symptom exacerbation, and 6-month prevalence of psychotic symptoms. RESULTS: After adjustment for patient characteristics, the supported-living participants experienced a significantly lower quality of life than the hospital patients, as indicated by two of the three PGCMS subscales and by the MANSA. Disparities were greatest in the subgroup of patients with psychotic disorders. No significant differences in mental stability were found between the two conditions. Eleven of the 96 supported-living participants had undergone temporary rehospitalization since their entry into the program.",

The purpose of this study was to assess the isometric (IT) and peak torque (PT) of the muscles responsible for shin rotation in patients after ACLR with an ST or with an STGR graft. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty patients with an ST graft and 20 patients with a combined STGR graft underwent a 6-month postoperative rehabilitation program after ACLR. At the end of the rehabilitation program, the IT and PT of the muscles responsible for internal (IR) and external rotation (ER) of the shin were measured.

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Rates of return to the operating room (OR) after definitive fusion for AIS vary, with a paucity of data on PS constructs. METHODS: A prospective multicenter database was retrospectively queried to identify consecutive patients with AIS who underwent posterior spinal fusion with either PS or Hb constructs with a minimum 2-year follow-up. All reoperations were stratified into an early group (<60 d) or a late group (>60 d). Univariate and multivariate logistical analyses were performed to identify potential risk factors related to reoperation. RESULTS: A total of 627 patients met the inclusion criteria (PS = 540, Hb = 87). There was a statistically significant difference in the rate of reoperations between the PS (3.5%) and Hb groups (12.6%), P<0.001. Early return to the OR occurred in 2.0% of the patients with PS compared with 3.4% in the Hb group, P = 0.43. Late returns to the OR occurred in 1.5% of PS group versus 9.2% of the Hb group, P<0.001.

DESIGN: Randomized control trial. SETTING: Accredited teaching practices of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners' Training Program. SUBJECTS: Thirty-four trainees and 1,500 consecutive adult patients ages 16-65 years. METHOD: Trainees randomly allocated to the experimental group participated in a 3-day interactive workshop on disease prevention during their 13-week family medicine term. Audiotapes of consultations with adults conducted by trainees at the beginning and end of the rotation were analyzed blind to compare assessment of patients' smoking status and, for women, date of last Pap smear. A questionnaire mailed to each patient after the consultation also allowed identification of smokers and women overdue for a smear. Consultations with these patients at risk were analyzed for preventive counseling. Inter- and intrarater reliability was calculated for audiotape analysis. RESULTS: Preworkshop rates of questions about smoking were low, occurring in 22% of consultations. While trainees allocated to the experimental workshop were more likely to ask a routine question about smoking at the end of the term than those in the control group (P = 0.01), two-thirds of smokers remained undetected irrespective of trainee group and fewer than one in five were advised to stop smoking.

The objectives of this study were to examine reliability and validity of concept sorting (ConSort) as a measure of static knowledge structure and to determine the relationship between concepts in static knowledge structure and concepts used during diagnostic reasoning. METHOD: ConSort was used to identify static knowledge concepts and analysis of think-aloud protocols was used to identify dynamic knowledge concepts (used during diagnostic reasoning). Intra- and inter-rater reliability, and correlation across cases, were evaluated. Construct validity was evaluated by comparing proportions of nephrologists and students with expert-type knowledge structure. Sensitivity and specificity of static knowledge concepts as a predictor of dynamic knowledge concepts were estimated. RESULTS: Thirteen first-year medical students and 19 nephrologists participated. Intra- and inter-rater agreement for determination of static knowledge concepts were 1.0 and 0.90, respectively. Reliability across cases was 0.45. The proportions of nephrologists and students identified as having expert-type knowledge structure were 82.9% and 55.8%, respectively (p=0.001).

METHODS: Surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to generate protein expression spectra in human NB (group I, n = 18) and healthy children (group II, n = 17) sera. Groups I and II mass spectral data were compared after baseline subtraction. Peaks with high signal-to-noise ratios were selected and grouped into bins with various intervals along mass-to-charge axis. Two-sample t test and 3-fold cross validation were used to identify differential biomarkers between groups I and II. RESULTS: Significant differentially expressed proteins were identified between groups I and II (P<or = .05).

All patients were contacted by mail or phone and were re-evaluated. All patients were reevaluated by questionnaire and local examination. Patients with erectile dysfunction were evaluated by color Doppler ultrasonography. RESULTS: Group I included 149 patients (82.8%) and group II included 31 (17.2%). In group I, patients presented to the emergency department from 1-24 hours (mean, 11.8) after occurrence of the penile trauma. Although patients in group II presented from 30 hours to 7 days (mean, 44.7 hours). Both groups were similar regarding etiology of injury, clinical presentation, surgical findings, and incidence of associated urethral injury. Mean follow-up period for group I was 105 months, and for group II it was 113 months. After such long-term follow up, 35 (19.4%) patients had complications; however, there was no statistically significant difference between both groups.",

        "input": "STUDY DESIGN: The association between leg length discrepancy and the side of the radiating pain in lumbar disc herniation was investigated in a case series. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether pain tends to radiate into the longer or shorter leg in patients with a lumbar herniated disc. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: No previous studies have investigated the association between leg length discrepancy and side of radiating pain in patients with a herniated disc. Results of studies of low back pain with radiation and leg length discrepancy are inconsistent concerning this association. METHODS: Of 132 consecutive patients admitted to a district hospital for surgical management of a lumbar herniated disc, leg length discrepancy was assessed using the indirect method as described by Calliet. RESULTS: Seventy-three patients (55%) were men, and 59 (45%) were women. The mean age was 40 years, and 99% of all herniated discs appeared at L4-L5 (n = 60) or L5-S1 (n = 71). In 64 (62%) of the 104 patients with a leg length discrepancy of 1 mm or more, the pain radiated in the shorter leg (P = 0.02). In subgroups of patients with larger leg length discrepancies, similar results were found but because of smaller sample sizes, these findings did not each statistical significance. In 32 of the 57 men (56.1%), the pain radiated to the shorter leg (P = 0.43); this was observed in 33 of the 47 women (70.2%; P = 0.01).",

STUDY DESIGN: The study included 75 hypertensive patients (34 males, 41 females; mean age 51+/-9 years) without coronary artery disease. Patients were evaluated in two groups depending on the presence or absence of MetS. Age- and gender-matched 20 healthy subjects (9 males, 11 females; mean age 50+/-5 years) comprised the control group. The diagnosis of MetS was based on the presence of at least three of five MetS criteria. Hypertension was defined as arterial blood pressure exceeding 140/85 mmHg on three consecutive measurements or the use of antihypertensive drugs. Echocardiographic measurements included interventricular septal thickness, left ventricular internal diameter, posterior wall thickness, aortic diameter, left atrial diameter, relative wall thickness, and left ventricular mass. RESULTS: Metabolic syndrome was present in 32 hypertensive patients (42.7%; 18 males, 14 females). The mean number of MetS criteria was 2.6+/-1.0 in the hypertensive group. Compared to the control group, patients with or without MetS exhibited significantly increased interventricular septum and posterior wall thickness, left atrial diameter, relative wall thickness, and left ventricular mass (p<0.05). The only significant difference between the two patient groups was that MetS was associated with a greater left atrial diameter (p=0.019). Left atrial diameter was correlated with the number of MetS criteria (r=0.51; p<0.001).",

Difficulty in teaching and evaluating professionalism may stem from generational differences between teachers and trainees in their definition of professional behavior. PURPOSE: We sought to explore the magnitude of generational differences by asking faculty and residents to evaluate behaviors along a continuum of professionalism. METHODS: A questionnaire composed of 16 vignettes describing unprofessional behaviors was distributed to a sample of internal medicine trainees and faculty. For each specific behavior described, participants were asked to rate the severity of the infraction on a 4-point scale. RESULTS: Within each group, responses were distributed across severity categories for most vignettes. There were no significant differences in the responses of trainees versus faculty for any of the vignettes except two.",

Our objective was to explore the effect of overlap that occurs in such comparisons and to develop a correction factor to adjust the test statistics and confidence intervals to allow for the effect in situations where the full data are not available. METHOD: The standard error of a difference between a statistic calculated for a subgroup and for the whole population was derived theoretically both ignoring and allowing for overlap. The ratio of these standard errors was defined as the correction factor. Cancer incidence and death data (1997-2001) for the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW) were examined to demonstrate the utility of the correction factor. RESULTS: If the overlap is ignored, significance tests are conservative and confidence intervals too wide. In an example with an overlap of 12%, the correction factor was 1.13 and the significance level of 0.08 was corrected to 0.05 by taking the overlap into account.",

At enhanced plant Zn uptake, grain Zn levels do not increase proportionally and within the grain the endosperm Zn levels remain below grain Zn levels. This study analysed the temporal dynamics of Zn concentrations in grain tissues during grain filling to find major bottlenecks. METHODS: Plants of two cultivars were grown at 1 and 5 mg Zn kg(-1) soil. Individual panicles were harvested 7, 14, 24 or 34 d after their flowering or at maturity and seeds were dissected into constituting tissues, which were analysed for Zn and other minerals. KEY RESULTS: The Zn concentration of the crease was found to increase five- to nine-fold between 7 and 34 d after anthesis, while that of the endosperm decreased by 7 and 45 % when grown at 1 or 5 mg Zn kg(-1), respectively. The Zn turnover rate (d(-1)) in the crease tissues was either independent of the Zn application level or higher at the lower Zn application level, and the Zn concentration increased in the crease tissues with time during grain filling while the turnover rate gradually decreased.",

Research teams visited each of these communities every two years since 1996 and conducted between 50 to 90 semistructured interviews. Additional information on hospital competition and strategy was gathered from secondary data. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We found that hospitals' strategic emphasis changed significantly between 1996-1997 and 2000-2001. In the mid-1990s, hospitals primarily competed on price through \"wholesale\" strategies (i.e., providing services attractive to managed care plans). By 2000-2001, nonprice competition was becoming increasingly important and hospitals were reviving \"retail\" strategies (i.e., providing services attractive to individual physicians and the patients they serve). Three major factors explain this shift in hospital strategy: less than anticipated selective contracting and capitated payment; the freeing up of hospital resources previously devoted to horizontal and vertical integration strategies; and, the emergence and growth of new competitors.",

METHODS: We analyzed the data of 2385 consecutive patients referred to our hypertension clinic for the performance of ABPM. Before ambulatory monitoring was performed, a nurse-measured BP was obtained three times using a Y-tube connecting the sphygmomanometer and the recorder. We compared the mean value of the three nurse-measured blood pressures with that of the 12h daytime ambulatory monitoring, considered as the reference. RESULTS: The difference between the nurse-measured and the ambulatory blood pressure was small but statistically significant, indicating that nurse-measured blood pressure tends to overestimate both diastolic and systolic blood pressure. The difference between the nurse blood pressure and ABPM was greater among treated hypertensive patients than untreated patients. To diagnose hypertension, defined as a blood pressure of over 140/90mmHg by ABPM, the positive predictive value of the nurse blood pressure was 0.81 and the negative predictive value 0.63. However, these predictive values could be improved with less stringent cut-off values of blood pressure.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to determine the efficiency of Femtosecond Laser-assisted cataract surgery in Fuchs endothelial dystrophy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 5 patients with 6 eyes underwent cataract surgery assisted by Femtosecond Laser LensX at Laser Optisan Clinic. Corneal changes before and after surgery and cumulative dissipated energy (CDE) were analyzed. RESULTS: Before surgery, our patients presented BCVA between 0.16-0.4, Pachymetry between 450-590 Lm, endothelial cells between 789-2008 mm2. The medium cumulative dissipated energy (CDE) used was 4.58 seconds. After surgery, BCVA improved in all patients and none of them developed corneal decompensation so far.",

DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: A non-proportional stratified random sample of 12,222 scratchcard buyers was approached. Regular scratchcard buyers (n = 3342) were asked to fill out the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS). Those with a SOGS score of 3 or more (n = 340) were interviewed with the gambling section of the DSM-IV Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS-T). Weighted data were used to obtain unbiased prevalence estimates. FINDINGS: The estimated prevalence of regular and potential problematic scratchcard gambling were 28.4% and 2.68%, respectively. Only 0.24% met DSM-IV criteria for PSG. Of those, only 0.09% were addicted uniquely to scratchcards. The remaining 0.15% were also addicted to other games of chance. Demographic and gambling characteristics of these 'combined' PSG (young men, mainly slot-machine players) resembled characteristics of pathological gamblers in general. In contrast to these 'combined' PSG, 'unique' PSG were mainly women between 25 and 34 years who spent relatively small amounts of money on scratchcards (equivalent to one scratchcard a day).",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Policymakers have proposed risk-adjusted bundled payment as the single most promising method of linking reimbursement to value rather than to quantity of service. Our objective was to assess the relationship between risk and cost to develop a model for forecasting the costs of cardiac operations under a bundled payment scheme. METHODS: All patients undergoing adult cardiac operations for which there was a Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) risk score over a 5-year period (2008 to 2013) at a tertiary care, university hospital were reviewed. Patients were stratified into five groups based on preoperative risk as a basis for negotiating risk-adjusted bundles. A multivariable regression model was developed to analyze the relationship between risk and log-transformed costs. Monte Carlo simulation was performed to validate the model by comparing predicted with actual fiscal year 2013 costs. RESULTS: Among the 2,514 patients analyzed, preoperative risk was strongly correlated with costs (p<0.001) but was able to explain only 28% (R(2) = 0.28) of the variation in costs between individual patients. The use of bundling to diffuse and adjust for risk improved prediction to only 33% (R(2) = 0.33). Actual costs in 2013 were $21.6M compared with predicted costs of $19.3M (\u00b1$350K), which is well outside the forecast's 95% confidence interval.",
        "output": "The results of this study suggest that risk-adjusted bundled payments may not be feasible for cardiac surgery due to the limited ability of risk scores to predict costs. The model was able to explain only 28% of the variation in costs, which is insufficient to make bundled payments a viable option. Furthermore, the actual costs in 2013 were $21.6M, which is significantly higher than the predicted costs of $19.3M, suggesting that risk-adjusted bundled payments may not be a feasible option for cardiac surgery."

We performed a cross-sectional study of weather-related AP effects on measures of SDB at the University of WashingtonMedicine Sleep Institute, a Seattle, Washington-based polysomnography lab located 200 feet above sea level. METHOD: Obstructive, central, and apnea-hypopnea indices from 537 patients were retrospectively correlated to mean 8-hour date-matched overnight AP data. Linear regression analysis and interquartile comparison of AP-related respiratory indices were performed and adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index. RESULTS: The obstructive apnea index increased with lower weather-related APs (p = 0.01 for linear trend), interquartile analysis showed significant worsening with lowered mean, minimum, and maximum nightly APs. Similar changes were not seen with central or apnea-hypopnea indices.",

Documented and evaluated data were crash history, trauma mechanism, number and pattern of injuries, injury severity, diagnostics, time flow, and missed diagnoses. Data were stored in our hospital information system. Seven time intervals were evaluated. In particular, attention was paid to the \"acquisition interval,\" the \"reformatting and evaluation time\" as well as the \"CT time\" (time from CT start to preliminary diagnosis). A standardized whole-body CT was performed. The acquired CT data together with automatically generated multiplanar reformatted images (\"direct MPR\") were transferred to a 3D rendering workstation. Diagnostic quality was determined on the basis of missed diagnoses. Head-to-toe scout images were possible because volume coverage was up to 2 m. Experienced radiologists at an affiliated workstation performed radiologic evaluation of the acquired datasets immediately after acquisition. RESULTS: The \"acquisition interval\" was 12 minutes +/- 4.9 minutes, the \"reformatting and evaluation interval\" 7.0 minutes +/- 2.1 minutes, and the \"CT time\" 19 minutes +/- 6.1 minutes.

We examined whether patients reported confusion about the options and whether confusion was associated with socio-demographic characteristics, number of options discussed, and adherence. METHODS: Patients ages 50 to 75 years who had visited a clinician within 2 years were randomly selected for a cross-sectional study (n = 6,100). A questionnaire mailed in 2007 asked the following: whether a clinician had ever discussed CRC screening options; which of four recommended tests (i.e., fecal occult blood testing, flexible sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, and barium enema) were presented; and whether the options were confusing. Analyses were restricted to respondents who reported discussing one or more screening options (n = 1,707). Weighted frequencies were calculated and multivariate logistic regression was done. RESULTS: The sample was 55.5% female, 15.6% African American, and 83.2% adherent to screening recommendations, and 56.0% had discussed two or more screening options. In adjusted analyses, nonadherent patients reported greater confusion than adherent patients (P<0.01). Adults who discussed two or more options were 1.6 times more likely to be confused than those who discussed one option [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.08-2.26]. Patients who reported being confused were 1.8 times more likely to be nonadherent to screening than those who did not (95% CI, 1.14-2.75).",

        "input": "PURPOSE: Historically, complication rates after colorectal surgery have been stratified by disease process, type of operation, or anesthesia risk derived after an intensive review of the medical record. Newer computer applications purport to shorten this process and predict the probability of postoperative complications by distinguishing them from comorbidities that are commingled on uniform discharge codes. We analyzed CaduCIS software, which uses discharge codes, to determine whether its predictions of comorbidity and complications were comparable to what was interpreted on the medical record. METHODS: Two-hundred seventy patients were analyzed according to the principal and secondary diagnoses coded on discharge. Coding inaccuracies of clinical occurrences were identified by physician review of each medical record. The actual incidences of 17 common preoperative comorbidities and 11 postoperative complications were compared with those predicted by CaduCIS. RESULTS: The CaduCIS-predicted distribution of comorbidities was similar to the actual occurrences in 15 of 17 categories. The overall incidence of complications obtained by physician (actual) review was 47 percent, compared with 46 percent predicted by CaduCIS. However, there was a statistical difference between the CaduCIS-predicted and the actual complication rates in 5 of the 11 categories. The most common preoperative comorbidity and complication was cardiopulmonary (47 percent and 28 percent, respectively).",
        "output": "The results of this study suggest that CaduCIS is a valid tool for predicting comorbidities and complications after colorectal surgery. The accuracy of the predictions was similar to what was observed on the medical records, with a few exceptions. The most common comorbidity and complication, cardiopulmonary, was also the most accurately predicted."

METHOD: Participants included 441 survivors who had undergone HSCT for a malignant or non-malignant disease. Data were obtained by a questionnaire positing a single open-ended question asking respondents to list the three issues of greatest importance to their QoL in survivorship. Responses were analysed and organised into QoL themes and subthemes. RESULTS: Major themes identified included the following: the failing body and diminished physical effectiveness, the changed mind, the loss of social connectedness, the loss of the functional self and the patient for life. Each of these themes manifests different ways in which HSCT survivor's world and opportunities had diminished compared to the unhindered and expansive life that they enjoyed prior to the onset of disease and subsequent HSCT.",
        "output": "The themes identified in this study reflect the significant impact that HSCT can have on a survivor's quality of life. The failing body and diminished physical effectiveness, the changed mind, the loss of social connectedness, and the loss of the functional self and the patient for life, all demonstrate how the world of the survivor can become a much smaller place after HSCT. The physical effects of the treatment can be seen in the diminished physical effectiveness, while the changed mind can be seen in the loss of social connectedness and the loss of the functional self. These themes demonstrate how the survivor's world can become much more restricted and how they may no longer feel like the same person they were prior to the treatment."

METHODS: An IRB-approved retrospective chart review was performed on patients age 0-18, who underwent an abdominal US evaluating for acute appendicitis from 2004 through 2013. Clinical data and specified outcomes were recorded, and exams were categorized into non-diagnostic studies and further separated into studies where the appendix was non-visualized. RESULTS: Of the 1383 studies included for analysis, 876 were non-diagnostic for acute appendicitis (63.34%) with 777 specifically because the appendix was non-visualized. Seven hundred forty of the 876 non-diagnostic studies and 671 of the 777 non-visualized studies were ultimately considered true negatives, corresponding to a negative predictive value (NPV) of 84.47 and 86.36%, respectively. In patients with WBC<7.5\u00d710(9)/L, the NPV of non-diagnostic and non-visualized studies increased to 97.12 and 98.86%, respectively.

A negative study could still indicate that the patient does not have appendicitis, but it could also indicate that the ultrasound was not able to visualize the appendix due to its location or other factors. Therefore, a negative study does not necessarily mean that the patient does not have appendicitis."

Immunosuppressive drugs may damage the transplanted organ through their direct toxic effects and by contributing to the development of chronic fibrosis and tubular atrophy. The aim of this study was to determine if immunosuppressive drugs per se affect the concentration of kidney damage markers, by using concentrations and doses of immunosuppressive within therapeutic, not toxic, levels in rat blood. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study involved 36 rats grouped according to the immunosuppressive regimen used (tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporin A, rapamycin, and prednisone). The rats were treated with a 3-drug protocol for 6 months. No drugs were administered to the control group. The blood samples were collected to determine the concentration of kidney damage markers by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: 1. In the groups receiving regimens based on cyclosporin A (CyA), significantly higher concentrations of KIM-1 in plasma was observed compared to cases not treated with drugs. 2. The use of tacrolimus was associated with increased concentrations of MCP-1 in plasma and rapamycin was associated with decreased concentrations of MCP-1 in plasma. 3.

However, these techniques are unreliable with dysmorphic upper sacral segments, U-fractures, osseous compression of neural elements, and previously failed fixation. Lumbopelvic fixation can potentially address these injuries but is a technically demanding procedure requiring spinal and pelvic fixation and it is unclear whether it reliably corrects the deformity and restores function.QUESTIONS/ PURPOSES: We therefore assessed reduction quality and loss of fixation, pain related to prominent hardware, subjective dysfunction measured by the Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA), and complications. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 15 patients with unstable sacral fractures treated with lumbopelvic fixation between 2002 and 2010. Patients had radiographic monitoring regarding reduction quality and loss of fixation and clinical followup using the SMFA. The minimum followup was 12 months (mean, 23 months; range, 12-41 months). RESULTS: Posterior reduction quality was 11 of 15 with less than 5 mm persistent displacement and four of 15 with 5 to 10 mm displacement. Loss of fixation was observed in one patient as a result of a technical error. Prominent hardware resulted in greater pain. Despite daily activity and bother subscores improving over time, we found long-term dysfunction in the SMFA. Eleven of the 15 patients were able to return to previous work or activities.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Maternal-neonate separation (MNS) in mammals is a model for studying the effects of stress on the development and function of physiological systems. In contrast, for humans, MNS is a Western norm and standard medical practice. However, the physiological impact of this is unknown. The physiological stress-response is orchestrated by the autonomic nervous system and heart rate variability (HRV) is a means of quantifying autonomic nervous system activity. Heart rate variability is influenced by level of arousal, which can be accurately quantified during sleep. Sleep is also essential for optimal early brain development. METHODS: To investigate the impact of MNS in humans, we measured HRV in 16 2-day-old full-term neonates sleeping in skin-to-skin contact with their mothers and sleeping alone, for 1 hour in each place, before discharge from hospital. Infant behavior was observed continuously and manually recorded according to a validated scale. Cardiac interbeat intervals and continuous electrocardiogram were recorded using two independent devices. Heart rate variability (taken only from sleep states to control for level of arousal) was analyzed in the frequency domain using a wavelet method. RESULTS: Results show a 176% increase in autonomic activity and an 86% decrease in quiet sleep duration during MNS compared with skin-to-skin contact.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: As annual crops develop, transpirational water loss increases substantially. This increase has to be matched by an increase in water uptake through the root system. The aim of this study was to assess the contributions of changes in intrinsic root hydraulic conductivity (Lp, water uptake per unit root surface area, driving force and time), driving force and root surface area to developmental increases in root water uptake. METHODS: Hydroponically grown barley plants were analysed during four windows of their vegetative stage of development, when they were 9-13, 14-18, 19-23 and 24-28 d old. Hydraulic conductivity was determined for individual roots (Lp) and for entire root systems (Lp(r)). Osmotic Lp of individual seminal and adventitious roots and osmotic Lp(r) of the root system were determined in exudation experiments. Hydrostatic Lp of individual roots was determined by root pressure probe analyses, and hydrostatic Lp(r) of the root system was derived from analyses of transpiring plants. KEY RESULTS: Although osmotic and hydrostatic Lp and Lp(r) values increased initially during development and were correlated positively with plant transpiration rate, their overall developmental increases (about 2-fold) were small compared with increases in transpirational water loss and root surface area (about 10- to 40-fold). The water potential gradient driving water uptake in transpiring plants more than doubled during development, and potentially contributed to the increases in plant water flow. Osmotic Lp(r) of entire root systems and hydrostatic Lp(r) of transpiring plants were similar, suggesting that the main radial transport path in roots was the cell-to-cell path at all developmental stages.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: During a period before PACS was introduced to radiologists, when images were still interpreted on film and reported on paper, images and reports were also digitally stored in an image database. The same database was used after the PACS introduction. This provided a unique opportunity to conduct a blinded retrospective study, comparing sensitivity (the main outcome parameter) in the pre and post-PACS periods. We selected 56 digitally stored chest radiograph examinations that were originally read and reported on film, and 66 examinations that were read and reported on screen 2 years after the PACS introduction. Each examination was assigned a random number, and both reports and images were scored independently for pathological findings. The blinded retrospective score for the original reports were then compared with the score for the images (the gold standard). RESULTS: Sensitivity was improved after the PACS introduction. When both certain and uncertain findings were included, this improvement was statistically significant. There were no other statistically significant changes.",

METHODS: We analyzed data in our trauma registry from 1994 to 1999 of patients with Injury Severity Score>or = 9 in whom trauma activations were called. Data reflected demographics, severity of injury, hospital course and outcome. Trauma activations were based on standard protocols that took physiologic status, anatomic area of injury, and mechanism of injury into account. Nineteen personnel were notified in a Trauma Stat Activation, and 8 were notified in a Trauma Minor Activation. RESULTS: There were 470 trauma activations: Trauma Stat = 220 and Trauma Minor = 250. As a group, Trauma Stat patients were more hemodynamically unstable, had a lower GCS and a higher Injury Severity Score than Trauma Minor patients.

Our objectives in this study were to characterize patients \u2265 65 years old with femoral fractures (subtrochanteric/diaphyseal) considered typical and atypical and the relationship between the occurrence of atypical fractures and bisphosphonate use. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a case-control study with patients admitted in our hospital with subtrochanteric or diaphyseal femur fracture in a period of five and a half years. After applying the exclusion criteria, the 92 fractures (91 patients) were classified as typical or atypical. The determination of prior bisphosphonate treatment was obtained through consultation of the individual medical history. RESULTS: We found 11 atypical fractures (10 patients) and 81 typical fractures (81 patients). The median age of both groups was statistically different (72 years - atypical vs. 80 years - typical, p&lt; 0.01). The reason for the use of bisphosphonates was 0.60 in atypical fractures and 0.01 in typical, and an odds ratio of 101.1 was obtained (p&lt; 0.01).

METHOD: Neurologic function was adequately assessed in 261 patients during surgery. The operation was uneventful in 234 patients, while 27 suffered from transient ischaemic neurologic deficit occurring mainly during carotid artery clamping. RESULTS: Postoperative neurologic complications occurred in 6 (2.5%) of the patients who were symptom-free during surgery and in 1 (3.7%) of the patients who experienced neurologic deficit during surgery (NS). In this group, two additional patients had peroperative neurologic deficit which lasted a few hours postoperatively so that the total incidence of postoperative neurologic deficit (11.1%) was significantly higher than in the other group (P<0.05).

Two forms (localized and multicentric) have been described. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is at the core of the disease, being responsible for most of the clinical and biological signs that may be observed. Despite the benignancy of this pre-lymphoma condition, its course is usually aggressive and of poor prognosis in regard to the multicentric form. No consensus regarding treatment has been defined. Available data on the multicentric form of the disease are to scarce to allow any conclusion about the treatment timing and type of chemotherapy best suited to this condition. We report the case of a patient in whom interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) was used as first line treatment. EXEGESIS: The case of a 52-year-old man with multicentric Castleman's disease combined with high IL-6, in whom, however, testing for human herpes virus-8 proved to be negative, is described. Interferon alpha (4.5 MU/m2 three times per week during 18 months) administered as first line treatment induced dramatic improvement in the patient's general condition and normalization of the tumoral syndrome. Moreover, biological parameters and IL-6 returned to normal. Two years after interferon disruption, complete remission is still present.",

Using a retrospective cohort design with data from the North West Adelaide Health Study, this study examined different aspects of smoking behaviour in adults aged 34-67 years who attended a Kindergarten Union preschool at some stage between 1940 and 1972. Data were analysed using generalised linear model poisson regression with robust variance estimates, adjusting for both child and adult socio-economic factors and history of parental smoking. RESULTS: People who attended preschool had a reduced risk of ever smoking (prevalence ratio 0.87, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.98) and a reduced risk of current smoking in adulthood (prevalence ratio 0.77 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.00)), compared with those who did not attend preschool. There was no effect of preschool attendance on age at smoking uptake, age at quitting or the probability of quitting smoking.",
        "output": "Attendance at a Kindergarten Union preschool is associated with a reduced risk of tobacco smoking in adulthood. This suggests that early childhood interventions may be an effective strategy for reducing the prevalence of smoking. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying this effect and to identify other strategies that could be used to reduce the prevalence of smoking."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the positive predictive value (PPV) of the malignancy of B3 lesions in order to establish their correct management in the setting of a multidisciplinary care pathway. METHODS: Data from all patients who had a Needle Core Biopsy (NCB) or a Vacuum-Assisted Needle Core Biopsy (VANCB) between 2005 and 2014 were retrospectively collected and analyzed. The B3 patients were discussed by the Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) deciding for surgery or for follow-up, based on a score in which clinical-instrumental factors and environmental factors were considered. The PPV of malignancy of all surgically excised B3 lesions was calculated. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-eight B3 NCBs were included in the study and Atypical Epithelial Proliferation of Ductal Type (AEDPT) was the most represented subcategory. The final histopathology report of the 128 patients operated on showed 94 benign and 34 malignant lesions. The PPV of B3 patients referred to surgery was 26.5%.",
        "output": "The positive predictive value of breast lesions of uncertain malignant potential (B3) is 26.5%, meaning that 26.5% of B3 lesions are malignant. Therefore, high risk patients can be identified and should be referred to surgery."

This research tested longitudinal measurement invariance of a 1-factor model of the metabolic syndrome during the course of 6 years. METHODS: Tests of longitudinal measurement invariance (configural, metric, and scalar) were conducted on 604 men and women who participated in the Spokane Heart Study from 1996 to 2006. Metabolic syndrome indicators included body mass index, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, diastolic blood pressure, and fasting glucose. RESULTS: Sequential configural and metric invariance models demonstrated adequate model fit, but the scalar invariance model led to a decrement in fit. Therefore, the theoretical framework of the syndrome and the relationships between the syndrome construct and the indicators appear to be equivalent over time. However, observed values of the metabolic syndrome indicators may differ across time when there is a constant level of the syndrome.",

Recent evidence suggests that variants in FTO directly affect human adipocyte function through targeting IRX3 and IRX5 and thermogenesis regulation.AIM: We addressed the relevance of this proposed FTO-IRX pathway in adipose tissue (AT) of children. RESULTS: Expression of IRX3 was higher in adipocytes compared to SVF. We found increased adipocyte-specific expression of IRX3 and IRX5 with the presence of the FTO risk haplotype in lean children, whereas it was unaffected by risk variants in obese peers. We further show that IRX3 expression was elevated in isolated adipocytes and AT of lean compared to obese children, particularly in UCP1-negative adipocytes, and inversely correlated with BMI SDS. Independent of BMI, IRX3 expression in adipocytes was significantly related to adipocyte hypertrophy, and subsequent associations with AT inflammation and HOMA-IR in the children.",
        "output": "The results of this study suggest that the FTO variants are associated with increased IRX3 expression in adipocytes of lean children, which is inversely related to BMI SDS. This suggests that the FTO variants may be protective against obesity in lean children, as higher IRX3 expression is associated with lower BMI. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and to determine the clinical relevance of these findings."

Given the increasing role of this treatment modality in the management of EOS, this study aimed to assess the psychological status of this patient population and to determine factors associated with worse scores in various psychosocial domains. METHODS: A cross-sectional assessment of 34 EOS patients was performed utilizing 2 well-established, caregiver-completed psychiatric instruments: the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire. Scores were calculated for 15 CBCL and 6 Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire domains and subdomains and grouped as \"Normal\" or \"Abnormal\" according to published normative values. The prevalence of abnormal scores was within each instrument subdomain and was compared with the national norms. Domain scores were also correlated with age at first scoliosis surgery, total number of operative procedures, and total number of growing instrumentation surgeries. RESULTS: A higher prevalence of Abnormal scores were found in multiple psychosocial domains in our cohort as compared with national normative data. Children with Abnormal CBCL \"Total Problems\" domain scores were younger at the time of first scoliosis surgery (2.50 vs. 5.52 y). Normal and Abnormal scoring groups showed significant differences in the number of (1) total surgeries; (2) total scoliosis surgeries; and (3) growing instrumentation surgeries in multiple domains on both instruments. Aggression, Rule-breaking, and Conduct were positively correlated with total number of surgeries.",

The contribution of the separate arteriolar and venular diameters to this AVR is unknown. Thus, associations between retinal arteriolar and venular diameters, and the AVR on the one hand and blood pressure, atherosclerosis, inflammation markers, and cholesterol levels on the other were examined in the Rotterdam Study. METHODS: In this cross-sectional population-based study, for one eye of each subject (>or =55 years; n = 5674), retinal arteriolar and venular diameters (in micrometers) of the blood columns were summed on digitized images.

Therefore a new scale, the Motor Evaluation Scale for Upper Extremity in Stroke Patients (MESUPES), was developed, comprising 22 items pertaining to arm and hand performance. The scale was investigated for validity and unidimensionality using the Rasch measurement model, and for inter-rater reliability. SETTING: Twelve hospitals and rehabilitation centres in Belgium, Germany and Switzerland. PATIENTS: There were 396 patients (average age 63.38+/-12.89 years) in the Rasch study and 56 patients (average age 65.68+/-12.75 years) in the reliability study. MAIN MEASURES: The scale was examined on its fit to the Rasch model, thereby evaluating the scale's unidimensionality and validity. Differential item functioning was performed to test the stability of item hierarchy on several variables. Inter-rater reliability was examined with kappa values, weighted percentage agreement and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). RESULTS: Based on Rasch analysis, five items were removed. The MESUPES was divided in two tests: the MESUPES-arm test (8 items) and MESUPES-hand test (9 items). Both scales fitted the Rasch model. All items were stable among the subgroups of the sample. ICCs were 0.95 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 -0.97) and 0.97 (95% CI 0.95-0.98) for the total score on arm and hand test respectively. The scale was also reliable at item level (weighted kappa 0.62 -0.79, weighted percentage agreement 85.71 -98.21).",

METHODS: A probability sample of elderly community-dwelling adults in North Carolina was assembled in 1986 and followed for 6 years. Level of participation in private religious activities such as prayer, meditation, or Bible study was assessed by self-report at baseline, along with a wide variety of sociodemographic and health variables. The main outcome was time (days) to death or censoring. RESULTS: During a median 6.3-year follow-up period, 1,137 subjects (29.5%) died. Those reporting rarely to never participating in private religious activity had an increased relative hazard of dying over more frequent participants, but this hazard did not remain significant for the sample as a whole after adjustment for demographic and health variables. When the sample was divided into activity of daily living (ADL) impaired and unimpaired, the effect did not remain significant for the ADL impaired group after controlling for demographic variables (hazard ratio [RH] 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI]0.91-1.35). However, the increased hazard remained significant for the ADL unimpaired group even after controlling for demographic and health variables (RH 1.63, 95% CI 1.20-2.21), and this effect persisted despite controlling for numerous explanatory variables including health practices, social support, and other religious practices (RH 1.47, 95% CI 1.07-2.03).",

It remains unclear whether the clinical results of the latissimus dorsi transfer for massive posterosuperior rotator cuff tears are achieved either by active muscle contractions or by a passive tenodesis effect of the transfer. METHODS: Eight patients were evaluated preoperatively and at 1\u00a0year (SD, 0.1) after the latissimus dorsi transfer. Clinical evaluation of outcomes included active range of motion, Constant score, and visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and activities of daily living (ADL). Muscle activity was recorded with EMG during directional isometric abduction and adduction tasks. RESULTS: The external rotation in adduction improved from 23\u00b0 to 51\u00b0 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.03). The external rotation in abduction improved from 10\u00b0 to 70\u00b0 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.02). The mean Constant score improved from 39 to 62 postoperatively (P\u00a0=\u00a0.01). The VAS for pain at rest improved from 3.3 preoperatively to 0.1 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.02). The VAS for ADL improved from 4.9 to 2.3 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.05). The transferred latissimus dorsi remained active in all cases, as reflected by increased latissimus dorsi EMG activity during abduction tasks.

However, controversy exists on the mechanisms underlying the apparent decrease of benefit from levodopa. OBJECTIVE: To study the response to levodopa in late-stage PD (LSPD). METHODS: 20 LSPD patients (Schwab and England ADL Scale<50 or Hoehn Yahr Stage>3 in MED ON) and 22 PD patients treated with subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) underwent an acute levodopa challenge test. MDS-UPDRS-III and the modified Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale were evaluated in off and after administration of a supra-maximal levodopa dose. RESULTS: LSPD patients had a median age of 78.8 (IQR: 73.5-82) and median disease duration of 14 years (IQR: 10-19.75). DBS patients had a median age of 66 (IQR: 61-72) and median disease duration of 18 years (IQR: 15-22). LSPD and DBS patients' MDS-UPDRS-III score improved 11.3% and 37% after levodopa, respectively. Rest tremor showed the largest improvement, while axial signs did not improve in LSPD. However, the magnitude of levodopa response significantly correlated with dyskinesias severity in LSPD patients. One third of LSPD and 9% of DBS patients reported moderate drowsiness.",

Advanced certification may translate into increased safety, yet we know of no charity air medical transportation requiring such certification. Herein, in a retrospective study, we determined whether commercial certification is associated with a reduced fatality rate compared with the less stringent private pilot certificate and accident causes. METHODS: The National Transportation Safety Board accident database was queried for fatal accidents in single-engine aircraft occurring between 2002 and 2012. Poisson and proportion tests were used in statistical analyses. RESULTS: For the period spanning 2002-2012, commercial pilots showed a lower fatality rate. Under visual meteorologic conditions, aerodynamic stall was a frequent cause for fatal accidents affecting both airman cohorts equally. For operations in instrument meteorologic conditions, fatal accidents were most commonly attributed to instrument approach deficiency and spatial disorientation. At night, failure to maintain obstacle/terrain clearance was the most prevalent cause of fatal crashes.",
        "output": "No, charity air medical organizations should not require commercial certification of their pilots. The results of this study show that commercial pilots have a lower fatality rate than private pilots, but the causes of fatal accidents are largely the same for both groups. Requiring commercial certification would not necessarily lead to increased safety, and may be an unnecessary burden for charity air medical organizations."

Body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) was calculated separately from reported and from actual measures. Adolescents' whose measured BMI was above the 85th percentile were characterized as 'at risk for overweight/obese'. RESULTS: There was no gender effect on the discrepancy between reported and actual measures. Overall adolescents significantly underestimated their weight and BMI.

In addition, wine consumption has decreased whereas beer intake has risen. Consequently, it is uncertain if the Mediterranean drinking pattern (MDP; moderate alcohol intake mainly from wine and during meals) is a habitual feature of the MD today. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cross-sectional study conducted from 2008 to 2010 among 8894 individuals representative of the Spanish population aged 18-64 years. Consumption of alcoholic beverages and food was collected with a validated diet history. Accordance with the MD was defined as a score \u22658 on the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) or \u22655 in the Trichopoulou index (after excluding alcohol intake from both indices).

A major discrepancy was separated from a minor discrepancy whereby a change in opinion significantly affected patient management. RESULTS: There were 506 second opinions during 2004 given by three consultant neuroradiologists. Incomplete data were found in 141. Forty-one percent were CT images and the remainder MRI. The majority of second opinions were requested by neurologists. Most of the remaining referrals were from neurosurgeons or the primary radiologist. There was a 13% major and a 21% minor discrepancy rate. The remaining 66% were in complete agreement. There was a mixture of overcalls, misinterpretation, and undercalls. There were similar rates of minor and major discrepancies in both CT and MRI.",

The uninsured and those with chronic medical conditions are high users of emergency care. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether access to comprehensive outpatient primary and specialty care and care coordination provided by The Access Partnership (TAP) reduced ED utilization among uninsured patients relative to patients who chose not to enroll. METHODS: Multiple time series analysis was performed to examine rates of ED utilization and inpatient admission among TAP patients and a comparison group of eligible patients who did not join (non-TAP patients). Monthly ED utilization and inpatient admission rates for both groups were examined prior to and subsequent to referral to TAP, within a study period 2007-2011. RESULTS: During the study period, 623 patients were eligible to enroll, and 374 joined the program. Rates of ED visits per month increased in both groups. Compared with non-TAP patients, TAP patients had 2.0 fewer ED visits not leading to admission per 100 patient-months post-TAP (P = .03, 95% confidence interval = 0.2-3.9).

Different pain management strategies depending on pain mechanism (neuropathic/nociceptive) make diagnosing the pain condition especially important. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether a validated, self-administered questionnaire (PainDETECT) helps specialists and general practitioners in Denmark identify patients with neuropathic pain components (NeP). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a non-interventional study a sample of Danish specialists (rheumatologists and anaesthesiologists) and general practitioners used the PainDETECT questionnaire on 1322 chronic pain patients. PainDETECT was filled in by patients and scored by the physician. A PainDETECT score above 18 indicates the presence of NeP. RESULTS: A total of 87-95% of the included chronic pain patients (702 by specialists (mean age: 56 years) and 620 by general practitioners (mean age: 55 years)) had musculoskeletal pain. In 39-43% of these patients NeP components were present as assessed by PainDETECT (score 21.1-21.7).

Our aim was to investigate changes in GP job satisfaction from 1987 to 1998, covering a period of major change in the organization of British general practice. METHODS: Postal surveys of random national samples of GPs were carried out by separate groups of investigators in 1987, 1990 and 1998. In each survey, the questionnaire contained a standardized job satisfaction scale and a list of 14 job stressors. The final samples consisted of 1817 GPs in 1987 (response rate 45%), 917 GPs in 1990 (response rate 61%) and 1828 GPs in 1998 (response rate 49%). RESULTS: For both men and women, overall job satisfaction declined from 1987 to 1990 and then improved from 1990 to 1998, although satisfaction in 1998 remained below that in 1987. Women tended to report higher levels of satisfaction than men in all 3 years. Satisfaction with nine specific aspects of work showed dissimilar patterns of change over time. From 1987 to 1990, reported levels of stress increased for eight of 14 job stressors. Of these, three subsequently declined in 1998, two remained unchanged and three continued to increase. Of the six job stressors which showed no change from 1987 to 1990, five subsequently increased as sources of stress. Men and women differed in their sources of stress, but the differences were not consistent over time.",
        "output": "The results of this study suggest that job satisfaction among GPs has declined since 1987, but has since improved. Women reported higher levels of satisfaction than men in all three surveys. The sources of job stress for both men and women changed over time, with some stressors becoming more common and others becoming less common. These findings suggest that the organization of general practice may have an impact on job satisfaction, and that further research is needed to understand the factors that influence job satisfaction among GPs."

METHODS: The OPO performance measures were correlated annually with the Herfindahl Hirschman Index, a standard measure of market competition for centers within the OPO donor service areas from 2003 to 2011. RESULTS: More competitive donor service areas were associated with increased number of donors (P = 0.01) and eligible deaths (P<0.001). Market competition was associated with increased use of high Donor Risk Index for kidney (P = 0.03) and liver (P = 0.01) allografts. The OPOs with increased competition in liver transplant also were noted to have a higher donor conversion rate (P<0.001), more donors per million population (P<0.001), and a higher utilization rate for liver allografts (P = 0.007).",

To quantitatively assess the overall association between birth weight and circulating cortisol level, we aimed to perform a meta-analysis of the published literature. METHODS: A literature search was conducted in PubMed, and selected papers were systematically reviewed. A pooled regression coefficient was calculated for the entire group as well as for males and females separately. RESULTS: Data from 11 study populations were pooled (n = 2301). These populations differed with respect to geographical area, age, sex distribution, inclusion criteria and gestational age. We found a statistically significant inverse association between birth weight and circulating cortisol level: a 1 kg lower birth weight was associated with a 25.3 nmol/l (95% confidence interval (CI): 5.9-44.8) higher cortisol level. Separate results were reported for males and females in six study populations. The association in males was 20.6 nmol/l per kg (95% CI: 4.2-37.0) and in females it was 30.9 nmol/l per kg (95% CI: 7.4-54.4).",

        "input": "PURPOSE: Mossy fibers are the sole excitatory projection from dentate gyrus granule cells to the hippocampus, forming part of the trisynaptic hippocampal circuit. They undergo significant plasticity during epileptogenesis and have been implicated in seizure generation. Mossy fibers are a highly unusual projection in the mammalian brain; in addition to glutamate, they release adenosine, dynorphin, zinc, and possibly other peptides. Mossy fiber terminals also show intense immunoreactivity for the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and immunoreactivity for GAD67. The purpose of this review is to present physiologic evidence of GABA release by mossy fibers and its modulation by epileptic activity. METHODS: We used hippocampal slices from 3- to 5-week-old guinea pigs and made whole-cell voltage clamp recordings from CA3 pyramidal cells. We placed stimulating electrodes in stratum granulosum and adjusted their position in order to recruit mossy fiber to CA3 projections. RESULTS: We have shown that electrical stimuli that recruit dentate granule cells elicit monosynaptic GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic signals in CA3 pyramidal neurons. These inhibitory signals satisfy the criteria that distinguish mossy fiber-CA3 synapses: high sensitivity to metabotropic glutamate-receptor agonists, facilitation during repetitive stimulation, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-independent long-term potentiation.",

RESULTS: Women were older than men (mean \u00b1 SD = 29.8 \u00b1 4.2 vs 28.9 \u00b1 3.8 yr), but for only two of the seven marathons, the Chicago and the London marathons (P<0.05): the sex difference in age was not consistent across the years. There was no sex difference in age for the Berlin, Boston, New York City, World Championship, and Olympic marathons. Men were faster than women (11.6% \u00b1 1.8%). The sex difference in running velocity varied across marathons (least for the World Championships, 10.2%) and also across years, but not systematically. This sex difference in running velocity increased from first to fifth place across all marathons.",
        "output": "No, there is not a significant sex difference in the age of elite marathon runners. The average age of elite marathon runners is slightly higher for women than for men, but this difference is not consistent across all marathons and has not changed significantly over time.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Sildenafil (Viagra) is a well-introduced medicine for erectile dysfunction; many studies about effects and side effects are published. Beside these aspects of treatment the influence of sildenafil on psychophysical performance is of interest. cGMP is one of the most important second messengers in the central nervous system (CNS), so even very small changes of the intracellular cGMP-level caused by phosphodiesterases inhibition may be relevant for CNS-function. We wanted to verify the hypothesis whether sildenfail influences human psychomotor performance, especially under the aspect of traffic safety, or not. METHODS: Designed as a pilot study we tested 6 male healthy volunteers using a test battery of 7 different psychophysical performances tests. Each individual did the test battery twice, once without drug and once after a single oral dose of 100-mg sildenafil. 3 persons did the first and 3 others did the second experiment under the influence of drug (UID). All results (37 parameters) were analysed by t-test for paired samples using a confidence interval of 95%. RESULTS: Only two parameters of 2 different tests showed significant differences. In the simple choice reaction test (DR2) the mean reaction time got better in the group with sildenafil; in the multiple choice reaction test with stress induction (RST3) the amount of wrong answers indicated a weak influence of performance without statistical significance, six parameters (dominantly in the speed anticipation test (DEST)) represented an increase and one other (RST3 second part) showed a decrease UID. The uppermost parameters (76% of all items) stayed on equal levels for both groups.",
        "output": "The results of this pilot study indicate that sildenafil has a weak influence on psychomotor performance, especially in the simple choice reaction test and the multiple choice reaction test with stress induction. The influence is not significant enough to cause any safety concerns in traffic."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-nine untreated patients with abdominal atypical lipomatous tumors/well-differentiated liposarcomas who had undergone contrast-enhanced CT were identified using an institutional database. Three radiologists who were blinded to the pathology findings evaluated all the images independently to determine whether a dedifferentiated component was present within the WDLPS. The CT images were evaluated for fat content (\u226425% or>25%); presence of ground-glass density, enhancing and/or necrotic nodules; presence of a capsule surrounding the mass; septations; and presence and pattern of calcifications. A multivariate logistic regression model with generalized estimating equations was used to correlate imaging features with pathology findings. Kappa statistics were calculated to assess agreement between the three radiologists. RESULTS: On the basis of pathological findings, 12 patients had been diagnosed with DDLPS within a WDLPS and 37 had been diagnosed with WDLPS. The presence of an enhancing or a centrally necrotic nodule within the atypical lipomatous tumor was associated with dedifferentiated liposarcoma (P = 0.02 and P = 0.0003, respectively).

        "input": "PURPOSE: Surveys of cancer patients are an important means of collecting data necessary to improve cancer prevention and control. However, health surveys generally are characterized by declining response rates, with incentives often employed to encourage participation. While successful, magnitude of effect is partially dependent upon situational characteristics of respondents, including health status. Given the health challenges experienced by cancer patients, it is unclear to what extent incentives can improve survey participation. In this study, we examine the effectiveness of monetary and non-monetary incentives in improving response to cancer patient surveys. METHODS: We reviewed the available experimental literature regarding efforts to improve response rates among cancer patients/survivors via incentives. Relevant studies were identified through searches of the MEDLINE, PubMed, and PsychINFO databases from 1975 to 2012. Seed sources (e.g., Cancer Causes&Control, Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers&Prevention, and BMC Medical Research Methodology) were also referenced extensively in order to establish a comprehensive set of studies. RESULTS: Although limited, evidence does suggest that token incentives may be less effective for improving survey participation among cancer patients, relative to other population groups. These results are contrary to well-established evidence regarding the efficacy of incentives in improving survey participation generally. Potential reasons why incentives may be less effective in this population are explored.",
        "output": "In conclusion, the available evidence suggests that incentives may be less effective in improving survey participation among cancer patients relative to other population groups. This is likely due to the health challenges experienced by this population, which may limit their motivation to participate in surveys. Additionally, the complex nature of cancer and its treatment may make it difficult for patients to understand and complete surveys. Further research is needed to better understand the situational characteristics of cancer patients that may affect their willingness to participate in surveys and the effectiveness of incentives in improving response rates."

By reducing doses of CsA or FK, we expected that renal function would improve. METHOD AND MATERIAL: Twenty-one patients with CAN had sirolimus added as an immunosuppressive agent. We evaluated the creatinine (Cr) level 3 months after addition. The doses of CsA and FK were decreased gradually and then eliminated over a course of 4 to 6 weeks. If the Cr level rose rapidly or other prominent signs of rejection occurred; low-dose CsA or FK would be added per protocol. We evaluated the duration of engraftment before sirolimus and the Cr level when it was added. RESULTS: Renal function improved in 13 of 21 cases. The improvement in Cr ranged from 12.5% maximally to 1.84% minimally. Seven of 13 cases still required low-dose CsA. The average duration of engraftment before sirolimus was 13.66 +/- 10.80 months. The average Cr level before sirolimus was 1.65 +/- 0.56 mg/dL. In the other eight cases, the Cr level kept rising from 5.1% to 20.4%. The average duration of engraftment was 88.38 +/- 42.21 months.

It is unknown whether executive function and impulsivity are unique predictors of these behaviours after accounting for intelligence. METHODS: Data from 6069 participants from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children were analysed to investigate whether components of executive function (selective attention, attentional control, working memory, and response inhibition) and impulsivity (parent-rated) measured between ages 8 and 10, predicted having ever drunk alcohol, having ever smoked, fruit and vegetable consumption, physical activity, and overweight at age 13, after accounting for intelligence at age 8 and childhood socioeconomic characteristics. RESULTS: Higher intelligence predicted having drunk alcohol, not smoking, greater fruit and vegetable consumption, and not being overweight. After accounting for intelligence, impulsivity predicted alcohol use (odds ratio = 1.10; 99% confidence interval = 1.02, 1.19) and smoking (1.22; 1.11, 1.34).

METHODS: Cases (work absent) and controls (working), selected from a larger study of injury outcomes according to reported work status 3-month after injury, completed a postal questionnaire. Work organisational factors were compared between cases and controls using univariate and multivariable analyses. RESULTS: One hundred and twelve participants completed the questionnaire (44 cases; 68 controls). Of 11 work organisation factors examined, organisational size was the only explanatory variable significantly associated with work status in the multivariable model.

Recent studies suggest that computed tomography (CT)-generated images have higher diagnostic accuracy than plain films for the classification of acetabular fractures. However, similar studies have not been performed for pelvic ring injuries. The purpose of this study was to compare CT-generated and plain radiographs in terms of the ability of surgeons at different experience levels to identify pelvic injury type. METHODS: CT-generated and plain radiograph image sets were created from 15 pelvic ring injury patients with known classification morphology. Three groups, each consisting of three orthopaedic surgeons representing different levels of expertise, viewed these image sets and recorded their diagnoses. These diagnoses were compared to the gold standard findings of the treating physician and to each other. RESULTS: Overall, there was a significantly improved ability to correctly classify pelvic ring injury type by CT-generated radiographs as compared to plain radiographs (p<0.01). However, analysis of the groups revealed that this difference was limited to the less experienced groups (p<0.05).",

METHODS: We analysed data from 567,049 respondents to the 2011/2012 English General Practice Patient Survey who reported at least one in-hours primary care consultation in the preceding 6\u2005months. Of those respondents, 7% also reported using out-of-hours primary care. We used logistic regression to explore associations between use of out-of-hours primary care and five measures of in-hours access (ease of getting through on the telephone, ability to see a preferred general practitioner, ability to get an urgent or routine appointment and convenience of opening hours). We illustrated the potential for reduction in use of out-of-hours primary care in a model where access to in-hours care was made optimal. RESULTS: Worse in-hours access was associated with greater use of out-of-hours primary care for each access factor. In multivariable analysis adjusting for access and patient characteristic variables, worse access was independently associated with increased out-of-hours use for all measures except ease of telephone access. Assuming these associations were causal, we estimated that an 11% relative reduction in use of out-of-hours primary care services in England could be achievable if access to in-hours care were optimal.",

A retrospective analysis of the parameters obtained with double-contrast barium enema (DCBE) and endorectal balloon computed tomography (CT) was conducted to verify the diagnostic reliability of the radiological techniques and to establish whether there is still an indication for their use. METHODS: 53 consecutive patients with adenocarcinoma of the distal half of the rectal ampulla underwent double contrast barium enema examination and CT of the pelvis with endorectal balloon. On the basis of the DCBE and CT assessment we evaluated: 1) the distance between the cranial extremity of the anal canal and the distal margin of the neoplasm; 2) the radial diffusion of the tumor; 3) the metastatic involvement of the perirectal and inferior mesenteric lymph nodes. RESULTS: 1) CT and DBCE measurements of the distal margin tended to coincide, but both tended to overestimate the measurement when compared to the pathologic examination; 2) in the identification of neoplastic infiltration of perirectal fat (T3) CT had 100% sensitivity, 78.7% specificity and 86.8% accuracy; 3) the CT sensitivity for detecting lymph node metastasis was 52.6%, specificity 85.3% and accuracy 73.6%.",

One key issue is the extent to which improvements in health resulting from ART allows individuals to return to work and earn income. Improvements in health from ART may also be associated with reduced impaired presenteeism, which is the loss of productivity when an ill or disabled individual attends work but accomplishes less at his or her usual tasks or shifts to other, possibly less valuable, tasks. METHODS: Longitudinal data for this analysis come from company payroll records for 97 HIV-infected tea estate workers (the index group, 56 women, 41 men) and a comparison group of all workers assigned to the same work teams (n = 2485, 1691 men, 794 women) for a 37-month period covering two years before and one year after initiating ART. We used nearest neighbour matching methods to estimate the impacts of HIV/AIDS and ART on three monthly employment outcomes for tea estate workers in Kenya--days plucking tea, days assigned to non-plucking assignments, and kilograms harvested when plucking. RESULTS: The female index group worked 30% fewer days plucking tea monthly than the matched female comparison group during the final 9 months pre-ART. They also worked 87% more days on non-plucking assignments.

The purpose of the present study was to determine if IMN<or = 24 hours after multisystem injury (Injury Severity Score (ISS)>16) is associated with a poor hospital outcome in the presence of blunt thoracic trauma (Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) thorax score>or = 2). METHODS: Retrospective cohort study at a single adult trauma center. RESULTS: In a 6-year period, 149 blunt trauma patients had both an ISS>16 and a femur fracture managed by IMN. These 149 patients were divided into four groups based on thoracic injury (T = AIS thorax score>or = 2; N = AIS thorax score<2) and the timing of IMN (E =<or = 24 hours; L =>24 hours). There were 68 TE, 57 NE, 15 TL, and 9 NL patients. The TE and NE groups were similar in age and ISS. TE and NE groups had similar durations of ventilation, critical care, hospital stay, and mortality. Furthermore, TE patients were no more likely to be intubated after IMN than NE patients. TE patients were matched with similar patients without a femur fracture and found to have similar hospital outcomes.",
        "output": "The results of this study suggest that early intramedullary nailing of a femur fracture in the presence of blunt thoracic trauma (AIS thorax score>or = 2) does not increase mortality or morbidity when compared to nonsurgical management.

We report descriptive statistics for all baseline characteristics collected at first clinic visit and primary outcomes of interest. We ascertain feasibility by reporting item completion rates for the EQ-5D and ICECAP-O. Contingency tables for a priori assertions between the ICECAP-O and EQ-5D were used to demonstrate whether unique or similar aspects of benefit were captured. We used exploratory factor analysis, to ascertain the number of unique underlying latent factors associated with the attributes assessed by the EQ-5D and ICECAP-O. RESULTS: We report data on 215 seniors who attended the Vancouver Falls Prevention Clinic who had a mean age of 79.3 (6.2) years. The item completion rate was 99 % for the EQ-5D and 92 % for the ICECAP-O. The two contingency tables detailed few discrepancies.

This is despite the fact that continuing education is an embedded feature of quality assurance in general practice. There are a variety of clinical practice education methods available for dissemination of new evidence. Recent systematic reviews indicate that the effectiveness of these different strategies is extremely variable. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine whether a peer-led small group education pilot programme used to promote rational GP prescribing is an effective tool in changing practice when added to prescribing audit and feedback, academic detailing and educational bulletins, and to determine whether any effect seen decays over time. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a controlled trial of a small group education strategy with 24 month follow-up was carried out. The setting was an independent GPs association (IPA) of 230 GPs in the Christchurch New Zealand urban area. All intervention and control group GPs were already receiving prescribing audit and feedback, academic detailing and educational bulletins. The intervention group were the first 52 GPs to respond to an invitation to pilot the project. Two control groups were used, one group who joined the pilot later and a second group which included all other GPs in the IPA. The main outcome measures were targeted prescribing data for 12 months before and 24 months after each of four education sessions. RESULTS: An effect in the expected direction was seen in six of the eight key messages studied. This effect was statistically significant for five of the eight messages studied.

However, the risk could have been underestimated as some factors were overlooked, namely monitoring trainees during average workload, placing dosimeters over the most susceptible locations, measuring the cumulative dosage of radiation and considering the dose limit for non-classified workers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective study in two centres to estimate the radiation dose to the hands of two consultant trauma surgeons and two trainees (one assisting and one operating) while performing 47 fluoroscopy-assisted procedures. We used validated thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) rings and fingerstalls for monitoring the cumulative dosage. RESULTS: Trainees were at higher risk while performing intramedullary nailing and during assistance. Higher radiation doses were recorded from dominant index fingers and particularly fingertips.",

METHODS: Two surgeons performed 277 femoral revisions graded as Paprosky Types I to IIIA between 2004 and 2009. When femoral canal diameter was less than 18 mm, these surgeons generally used the shortest stem capable of achieving a minimum of 4 cm of scratch fit in the femoral isthmus. Patients were evaluated clinically using the Harris hip score and radiographically for component loosening and to determine whether the revision component bypassed the prior stem tip or cement mantle. RESULTS: A short stem was utilized in 144 of the 277 revisions (52%). In 113 (78%), the revision femoral component did not bypass the tip of the prior stem or cement mantle. The Harris hip score improved (p<0.001) from 36 preoperatively to 76 at a mean of 4 years (range, 2-8 years). Twelve stems required repeat revision including six (4.9%) for failed ingrowth.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: TAs and QOL data were collected longitudinally in 197 cancer patients (lung cancer, 54.3%; pancreatic cancer, 19.3%; colorectal cancer, 26.4%; age, 65.2 +/-10.4 years; male, 57.4%) who were receiving CT at the Department of Internal Medicine at Kufstein County Hospital, giving rise to a total of 1,024 assessment times. Patients completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 questionnaire and two additional questions taken from the EORTC item bank concerning TAs. Statistical analyses were performed using mixed-effect models. RESULTS: The study showed that the prevalence of TAs in chemotherapy patients is alarmingly high (69.9%). There were clear differences in TA scores among treatment groups: patients receiving irinotecan reported significantly more TAs than patients in other treatment groups; patients receiving a combination of gemcitabine and a platinum agent reported the lowest TAs. Additionally, significant associations between TAs and several QOL dimensions were found, especially with appetite loss and fatigue.",
        "output": "The prevalence of taste alterations in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy is alarmingly high, with significant differences in taste alteration scores among treatment groups. Patients receiving irinotecan reported significantly more taste alterations than patients in other treatment groups, and patients receiving a combination of gemcitabine and a platinum agent reported the lowest taste alteration scores. Additionally, taste alterations were associated with appetite loss and fatigue, suggesting that taste alterations may have a negative impact on quality of life."

However, the higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Mexican-origin populations might be related, in part, not to Native American genetic admixture but to Spanish genetic admixture. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Four population-based epidemiological surveys conducted with Mexican-origin and European-origin samples provided data relevant to this question. In all four surveys, type 2 diabetes was defined as fasting plasma glucose>or =7.0 mmol/l or 2-h glucose>or =11.1 mmol/l or use of antidiabetic agents. RESULTS: A comparison of the two Mexican-origin populations showed that the age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of type 2 diabetes was lower in Mexico than in SA-MA (15.1 vs. 17.9%, P = 0.032). Between the two European-origin populations, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes was lower in SA-NHW than in Spain (6.2 vs. 9.1%, P<0.0001), but differences were attenuated by adjustment for BMI or after stratification by education. In logistic regression analyses, type 2 diabetes was associated with Mexican ethnic origin after adjusting for age, education, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio.",

        "input": "PURPOSE: We prospectively tested the extent to which witnessing school violence predicts psychosocial and school adjustment in students while accounting for their prior psychosocial characteristics and peer victimization. We also explored the role of feelings of insecurity in explaining this relationship. METHODS: Questionnaires were administered to 1104 students (52% boys) from five high schools from the Montreal area (Quebec, Canada) at the beginning, middle, and end of seventh grade. Self report measures included sociodemographic characteristics, victimization, witnessing violence, feelings of insecurity, internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, and measures of engagement, achievement, and truancy as indicators of school adjustment. RESULTS: Witnessing school violence was a comparatively better predictor of subsequent externalizing problems and school adjustment than actual victimization. Conversely, relative to having experienced violence as a witness, actual victimization more reliably estimated later internalizing problems. Feelings of insecurity partially explained the development of school engagement and truancy.",
        "output": "Yes, witnessing school violence can have detrimental effects on psychosocial and school adjustment in early adolescence. Witnessing school violence is associated with increased externalizing problems and school adjustment difficulties, while actual victimization is associated with increased internalizing problems. Feelings of insecurity also play a role in the development of these outcomes."

The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors involved in developing air leaks and the consequences of PAL. METHODS: All patients undergoing lung resection between January 2002 and December 2007 in our hospital were studied retrospectively. Univariate analysis to predict risk factors for developing post-operative air leaks included patient demographics, smoking status, pulmonary function tests, disease aetiology (benign, malignant), neoadjuvant therapy (pre-operative radiotherapy/chemotherapy), extent and type of resection, and different consultant surgeons' practice. A logistic regression model was used for multivariate analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1,911 lung resections were performed over the 6-year study period. An air leak lasting more than 6 days post-operatively was present in 129 patients (6.7%). This included 100 out of the 1,250 patients (8%) from the lobectomy group and 29 out of the 661 patients (4.4%) from the wedge/segmentectomy group. Using the multivariate analysis, the risk factors for developing an air leak included a low predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (pFEV(1)) (p<0.001), performing an upper lobectomy (p=0.002) and different consultant practice (p=0.02). PAL was associated with increased length of stay (p<0.0001), in-hospital mortality (p=0.003) and intensive care unit readmission (p=0.05).",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-eight patients who underwent polysomnography (PSG) between December 2010 and November 2012 consecutively were recruited and they completed the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) questionnaires. Based on the apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI), patients were classified as primary snorers (AHI<5), suffering from mild (5 \u226415), moderate (15 \u226430) or severe OSA (\u226530). RESULTS: Seventy-nine male and 9 female patients with a mean age of 41 years were recruited. OSA patients scored significantly lower on 7 domains of SF-36 compared to the population. As AHI increased, only Physical Function (PF) and Physical Component Summary (PCS) but not ESS scores significantly worsened. PSG parameters correlated poorly with all QOL measures except PF, PCS and ESS. After adjusting for age, sex and body mass index (BMI), multiple linear regression revealed that only the oxygen desaturation parameters, but not sleep architecture indices or AHI were significant predictors of PF and ESS. For every fall in the lowest oxygen saturation (LSAT) by 1%, there was a decrease in PF by 0.59 points, and an increase in ESS by 0.13 points.",
        "output": "This study found that OSA is associated with poorer quality of life, as measured by the SF-36 and ESS questionnaires.

Postulating that overmedication with fluoxetine can appear as response failure (as norfluoxetine accumulates), systematic trials of lower doses were conducted in patients who failed to respond despite apparent initial improvements. METHOD: Of 23 consecutive outpatients treated with fluoxetine 20 mg/day for DSM-III-R major depression, 4 failed to sustain initial improvements during 4-8 weeks of treatment (in the absence of apparent side effects). In these 4 patients, fluoxetine was withdrawn for 2 weeks, then reinstituted at 20 mg q.o.d. All patients were followed up weekly to monthly (for up to 17 months) and administered the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. RESULTS: Four of 4 patients improved during washout and went on to respond to the lower dose. All 4 cases are presented. On review of the literature, fluoxetine fixed-dose studies reveal increased adverse effects with no increase in efficacy at dosages above 5 mg/day and decreased efficacy at dosages above 40 mg/day. Special issues inherent in the study and use of an antidepressant with a 1- to 3-week active half-life are discussed.",

The literature suggests that fluoxetine is most effective at dosages of 5-20 mg/day, with decreased efficacy at dosages above 40 mg/day. The 1- to 3-week half-life of fluoxetine may also contribute to the difficulty of achieving an optimal therapeutic dose."

        "input": "BACKGROUND: In massively bleeding patients, pressure infusers are used for transfusion of red blood cells and plasma but not for platelets (PLTs) due to an assumed negative effect on the PLTs. This study examined whether pressure-aided in vitro transfusion affected the number, activation state, and/or function of the PLTs as measured by flow cytometry and thrombelastography (TEG). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: PLT concentrates stored for 1 (n = 8) or 8 (n = 7) days were transfused in vitro by means of a pressure inducer (300 mmHg). Samples before and after transfusion were measured for PLT concentration and expression of CD62P, CD63, and PAC-1. These activation markers were measured by flow cytometry on resting PLTs as well as PLTs stimulated with thrombin receptor-activating peptide. Clot generation and strength was examined by TEG by measuring the angle (degree) and maximum amplitude (mm), values that are highly dependent on the PLT function. RESULTS: PLT concentrations were unchanged after pressure-aided transfusion reflecting no destruction. With respect to activation state and in vitro functional capacity either no or only minor differences (<7%) were detected.",

These patients are frequently limited by severe dyspnoea and exertional desaturation. Available guidelines suggest two ISWT are needed; however, this is time consuming and it has not been reported whether a practice ISWT is necessary in ILD. We aimed to investigate if a practice ISWT is needed for patients with ILD referred to PR. METHODS: Patients with ILD who attended a PR assessment performed two ISWT as per standard protocol. Hospital notes were retrieved and relevant data extracted and validated. Endurance shuttle walk test (ESWT) level was calculated at 85% VO2 peak as estimated from the first ISWT (ISWT 1) and second ISWT (ISWT 2). RESULTS: Forty-three patients were included (18 with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis). There was a mean change of 28.84 (31.71) m between the two ISWT (P<0.001) with 72.1% of patients walking further on ISWT 2. A Bland-Altman plot showed good agreement between the ISWTs; however, the limits of agreement were wide. There was a significant difference in ESWT levels (P<0.001) when calculated from ISWT 1 and ISWT 2. ISWT 1 distance, post-ISWT 1 heart rate and baseline Borg breathlessness score were significant variables (P<0.05) in linear regression, but this only explained 42.6% of the variance (R(2) 0.426).",

        "input": "INTRODUCTION: Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a manifestation of venous thromboembolism (VTE). It has been estimated that there are 900,000 cases of pulmonary emboli (PE) and DVT per year resulting in 60,000 to 300,000 deaths. About two-thirds of VTE cases are associated with prolonged hospitalizations, emphasizing the importance of major surgery or immobilization as risk factors. METHODS: Retrospective study conducted in a Metropolitan Hospital. A total of 46 records were obtained from the hospital database following the established inclusion and exclusion criteria. For the control group a total of 42 records were selected. Patients included in this study were admitted with the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis identified either by lower leg Doppler. RESULTS: Monocytosis with DVT, p-value was<0.001, with an Odd Ratio (OR) 9.35 and Interval Confidence (IC) 95% (3.2-27.3). The p-value for eosinophilia with DVT was 0.092, for males with DVT the p-value was 0.35 and age related groups with DVT value was 0.720. Sensitivity of monocytosis was 67.3%, specificity 80%, positive predictive value (PPV) 79.49% and negative predictive value (NPV) 63.9%.",

The odds ratio for monocytosis and deep vein thrombosis is 9.35, meaning that a patient with monocytosis is 9.35 times more likely to develop deep vein thrombosis than a patient without monocytosis. The confidence interval for this ratio is 3.2 to 27.3, meaning that the true value of the ratio could be anywhere between 3.2 and 27.3. The sensitivity of monocytosis for deep vein thrombosis is 67.3%, meaning that monocytosis is a good indicator of deep vein thrombosis.

Two regimens were applied: homogeneous irradiation of the right lung or partial irradiation of both lungs-including parts with lower dose-but with similar mean lung doses. The animals were treated with five fractions with a linear accelerator applying a CT-based treatment plan. The clinical lung reaction (breathing frequency) and morphological changes in CT scans were examined frequently during the 48\u00a0weeks after irradiation. RESULTS: A clear dose-effect relationship was found for both regimens of the trial. However, a straightforward relationship between the MLD and the relative number of responders with respect to different grades of increased breathing frequency for both regimens was not found. A morphologically based parameter NTCPlung was found to be more suitable for this purpose. The dependence of this parameter on the MLD is markedly different for the two regimens.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 119 consecutive patients with gastric cancer were interviewed preoperatively between 2001 and 2003 at the Department of Surgery, Helsinki University Central Hospital. Abdominal symptoms, previous endoscopies, previous H. pylori testing and eradication therapies were recorded. RESULTS. Of these patients, 112 (94%) had abdominal symptoms before the cancer diagnosis, and in 110 patients (92%) these symptoms were alarming or had changed before the cancer diagnosis. Thirty-five patients (29%) had received H. pylori eradication therapy prior to the diagnosis of gastric cancer (15 after onset or change in symptoms, 10 more than 5 years prior to the cancer diagnosis).

We hypothesized that combined left (LA) and right atrial (RA) volumes physiologically best reflect hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (HSPDA), and utilized two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) derived atrial volumes to test this hypothesis. METHODS: 2DE examinations with good-quality images in 138 neonates<3 months corrected gestational age with PDA, and 50 normal neonates without PDA were selected. Measurements of LA, RA, and combined atrial volumes were performed, in addition to transductal diameters, left atrial to aortic dimension (LA:Ao), and left ventricular end-diastolic to aortic dimension ratios. An experienced cardiologist, blinded to 2DE images of atria and ventricles and to the above measurements, independently assessed HSPDA based only on images and Doppler data of the ductus itself, thus identifying each PDA as of low hemodynamic significance or HSPDA. RESULTS: Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves showed indexed LA volumes and LA/RA volume ratios to have moderate power to discriminate HSPDA from low hemodynamic burden PDA. Classic LA:Ao ratio, combined atrial volumes, and RA volumes yielded ROC areas that appeared less promising as discriminators for HSPDA.",

METHODS: Providers in an adolescent-oriented maternity program were cued electronically, when they opened the electronic medical records of 0- to 6-month-old infants to conduct well-child visits, to ask the mothers to complete the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale. Incident cases represented mothers who crossed the referral threshold (score of>or =10) after the first screening. RESULTS: Mothers usually brought their infants to the clinic, and none refused screening. Providers could act on 99% of the 418 screening cues; they administered the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale 98% of the time and always referred mothers with scores of>or =10. Overall, 20% of the mothers scored>or =10. Scores were unstable at<or =3 postpartum weeks (kappa = 0.2). Thereafter, the prevalence and incidence of scores of>or =10 decreased from 16.5% at 2 months to 10.3% and 5.7%, respectively, at 4 months.

STUDY DESIGN: A descriptive and clinical study, with review of patient data. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed 113 referred cases of oral mucocele. The following anatomical sites were identified: lip, tongue, and floor of the mouth (simple ranulas), as well as plunging ranulas. The age and gender data of the patients with oral mucoceles were recorded. The HIV status of the patients and other information were reviewed. RESULTS: There were 30 (26.5%) males and 83 (73.5%) females. Most patients were below 30 years of age, with the peak frequency in the first and second decade. Ranula (simple and plunging) represented 84.1% of the mucocele locations. Mucocele on the lips represented 10.6%. Seventy-two (63.7%) patients were HIV positive; and 97.2% of them had ranulas. Thirty-eight (33.6%) patients presented with plunging ranulas; and 92.1% of them were HIV positive, compared with two patients presenting with plunging ranulas in the HIV-negative group. These results strongly suggest that an HIV-positive patient is statistically (P<0.001) more at risk of presenting with not only a simple, but also a plunging ranula type.",

Previous research examining health and well-being differentials between women with and without children has produced conflicting results. Most of this research has been conducted in the United States or parts of Europe. There has been limited research in Australia that has examined the health and well-being of women with and without children across the life course. The aim of the current study was to examine the association between motherhood status and general physical and mental health and well-being over a 10-year time period. METHODS: Using 10 waves of data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia study, longitudinal linear mixed models with time varying variables (both dependent and independent) were constructed to assess the effect of childlessness on health and well-being based on the Short Form-36 Health Survey Version 1 (n=52,381 observations). FINDINGS: Findings suggest that childless women experience poorer physical and mental health and well-being during the peak reproductive years; however, this trend is reversed for women aged 65 years or more. Although never-married, childless women experienced better health and well-being compared with mothers, this was not the case for childless women who were divorced, separated, or widowed or in a relationship.",

If RhIG Fc delivers a nonspecific immunosuppressive signal, then RhIG may inhibit sensitization to antigens other than D. HLA antibody prevalence was compared in previously pregnant D- versus D+ women to investigate whether RhIG suppresses HLA sensitization. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In the Leukocyte Antibody Prevalence Study (LAPS), 7920 volunteer blood donors were screened for anti-HLA and surveyed about prior pregnancies and transfusions. A secondary analysis of the LAPS database was performed. RESULTS: D- women not more than 40 years old (presumed to have received antenatal with or without postpartum RhIG in all pregnancies) had a significantly lower HLA sensitization rate than D+ women (relative risk, 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40-0.83). When stratified by deliveries (one, two, three, or four or more), D- women not older than 40 were HLA sensitized less often than D+ women in every case. In contrast, a clear relationship between D type and HLA sensitization was not seen in older previously pregnant women whose childbearing years are presumed to have preceded the use of routine RhIG prophylaxis. In a multivariable logistic regression model, D- women not more than 40 years old remained significantly less likely to be HLA sensitized compared with D+ women after adjusting for parity, time from last pregnancy, lost pregnancies, and transfusions (odds ratio [OR], 0.55; 95% CI, 0.34-0.88).",

Service innovations have been linked to the changes in the way that healthcare organizations organize their work. The objective of this study is to explore the relationship between organizational service innovations and Electronic Health Record (EHR) adoption in the RCFs. METHODS: We used the data from the 2010 National Survey of Residential Care Facilities conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The outcome was whether an RCF adopted EHR or not, and the predictors were the organizational service innovations including provision of skilled nursing care and medication review. We also added facility characteristics as control variables. Weighted multivariate logistic regressions were used to estimate the relationship between service innovation factors and EHR adoption in the RCFs. RESULTS: In 2010, about 17.4% of the RCFs were estimated to use EHR. Multivariate analysis showed that RCFs employing service innovations were more likely to adopt EHR. The residential care facilities that provide skilled nursing services to their residents are more likely (OR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.09-1.87) to adopt EHR. Similarly, RCFs with a provision of medication review were also more likely to adopt EHR (OR: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.00-1.95).

The aims of this study were to investigate whether left atrial (LA) volume and pulmonary venous (PV) anatomy, evaluated by computed tomography (CT) prior to ablation, will predict AF recurrence following catheter ablation. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 146 patients (mean age 57 +/- 11 years, 83% male) with symptomatic AF (55% paroxysmal, 18% persistent, 27% long-standing persistent). All patients underwent CT scanning prior to catheter ablation to evaluate LA volume and PV anatomy. Circumferential PV isolation was performed guided by Cartomerge electroanatomical mapping. The outcome was defined as complete success, improvement, or failure. After a mean follow-up of 19 +/-7 months, complete success was achieved in 59 patients (40%), and 38 patients (26%) demonstrated improvement. LA volume was found to be an independent predictor of AF recurrence with an adjusted OR of 1.14 for every 10-mL increase in volume (95% CI 1.00-1.29, P = 0.047). PV variations were equally distributed among the different outcomes of the ablation procedure, and therefore univariate analysis did not identify PV anatomy as a predictor of outcome.",

Our aim was to determine the possibility of noninvasively distinguishing early-stage NASH from SS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used Fick's principle and the Kety-Schmidt equation to determine the hepatic tissue blood flow (TBF) in 65 NASH patients who underwent xenon computed tomography (Xe-CT). We calculated the lambda value (LV), i.e., Xe gas solubility coefficient, in liver and blood. We assessed the histological severity of fatty changes and fibrosis on the basis of Brunt's classification. Liver biopsy revealed SS in 9 patients and NASH in 56 patients. NASH stages 1 and 2 were classified as early-stage NASH (Ea-NASH; 38 patients) and stages 3 and 4 as advanced-stage NASH (Ad-NASH; 18 patients). We evaluated the differences in LV and TBF among the 3 groups. RESULTS: LV was significantly lower in the Ad-NASH group than in the SS and Ea-NASH groups. Portal venous TBF (PVTBF) was significantly lower in the Ea-NASH group than in the SS group, and PVTBF was lower in the Ad-NASH group than in the Ea-NASH group. Total hepatic TBF (THTBF) was significantly different between the SS and Ea-NASH groups and between the SS and Ad-NASH groups.",

In this study, we aimed to identify the correlation between HVS on FLAIR and hypointense vessels on SWI, and to determine whether these imaging features provide independent prognostic information in patients with ischemic stroke. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed consecutive ischemic stroke patients with proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion who underwent SWI and FLAIR within 24 h of symptom onset. The presence of hypointense vessels on SWI and hyperintense vessels on FLAIR in>4 of 10 slices encompassing the MCA territory were considered to represent prominent hypoperfusion. RESULTS: Among 50 patients, 62% had a prominent HVS on FLAIR and 68% had prominent hypointense vessels on SWI. There was a moderate but significant correlation between the number of slices with HVS on FLAIR and prominent hypointense vessels on SWI (r=0.425, P = 0.002). In multivariate analyses, the prominence of hypointense vessels on SWI, but not HVS on FLAIR, was significantly associated with a higher discharge NIHSS score (P = 0.027), mRS score (P = 0.021), and lesion growth (P = 0.050).",

There was a normal increase of plasma lactate during forearm ischemic exercise, but lactate did not change during dynamic, submaximal exercise in contrast to the fourfold increase in healthy subjects. Constant workload elicited a second wind in all patients with McArdle disease, but not in the patient with PHK deficiency.

METHODS: Open-ended questions about cancer and heart disease risk factors were included in a population-based survey of 1,747 British adults. Responses were coded for causal beliefs about genetics and lifestyle (smoking, diet, alcohol, exercise). RESULTS: One third of the respondents identified genetic factors as influencing cancer (35%) and heart disease (36%) risk. Identifying genetic risk was associated with female gender, older age and education for both diseases, as well as with family history for heart disease. Individuals identifying genetic influences on cancer risk were more likely to identify diet (p<0.001) and exercise (p<0.05), and mentioned more lifestyle factors overall (p<0.05), independent of demographics and family history.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Low fruit and vegetable (FV) intake is a leading risk factor for chronic disease globally, but much of the world's population does not consume the recommended servings of FV daily. It remains unknown whether global supply of FV is sufficient to meet current and growing population needs. We sought to determine whether supply of FV is sufficient to meet current and growing population needs, globally and in individual countries. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used global data on agricultural production and population size to compare supply of FV in 2009 with population need, globally and in individual countries. We found that the global supply of FV falls, on average, 22% short of population need according to nutrition recommendations (supply:need ratio: 0.78 [Range: 0.05-2.01]). This ratio varies widely by country income level, with a median supply:need ratio of 0.42 and 1.02 in low-income and high-income countries, respectively. A sensitivity analysis accounting for need-side food wastage showed similar insufficiency, to a slightly greater extent (global supply:need ratio: 0.66, varying from 0.37 [low-income countries]to 0.77 [high-income countries]). Using agricultural production and population projections, we also estimated supply and need forFV for 2025 and 2050. Assuming medium fertility and projected growth in agricultural production, the global supply:need ratio for FV increases slightly to 0.81 by 2025 and to 0.88 by 2050, with similar patterns seen across country income levels. In a sensitivity analysis assuming no change from current levels of FV production, the global supply:need ratio for FV decreases to 0.66 by 2025 and to 0.57 by 2050.",

A single-leg squat (SLS) is commonly used by clinicians to assess movement control, but whether it can provide insight into control during more dynamic sporting movements in AGP patients is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationships between biomechanical measures in an SLS and the same measures in a single-leg drop landing, single-leg hurdle hop, and a cutting maneuver in AGP patients. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Biomechanics laboratory. PATIENTS: 40 recreational field-sports players diagnosed with AGP. INTERVENTION: A biomechanical analysis of each individual's SLS, drop landing, hurdle hop, and cut was undertaken. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hip, knee, and pelvis angular displacement and hip and knee peak moments. Pearson product-moment correlations were used to examine relationships between SLS measures and equivalent measures in the other movements. RESULTS: There were no significant correlations between any hip or pelvis measure in the SLS with the same measures in the drop landing, hurdle hop, or cut (r = .03-.43, P>.05).

The aim of this study was to examine to what extent services limited pad supplies and what criteria were in operation to govern the supply. METHODS: A questionnaire exploring the current practice in conferring eligibility and prescribing and providing continence products was developed and distributed to all continence services in Great Britain, using a database of services. Data were analyzed from all returned questionnaires to all continence services on the Continence Foundation database and were also extracted from the 2006 National Audit of Continence Care for Older People. RESULTS: Few continence services employed clear and detailed criteria for issuing continence pads and, when present, written criteria used arbitrary cutoffs for measuring incontinence severity. Rationing was widespread, and the most common adult pad allowance was 4 per day. In addition, 59% of continence services provided pads to children below the recommended age of 4 years.",

The median age of newly diagnosed patients with lung cancer in the United States is approximately 70 years. Despite this, the elderly are significantly underrepresented in clinical trials. This has led to increasing uncertainty as to their optimal treatment. Here, we seek to determine the proportion of elderly patients in key phase III clinical trials in advanced NSCLC. METHODS: A literature search for all phase III trials of systemic therapy for advanced NSCLC between 1980 and 2010 was performed using PubMed. The 100 most highly cited trials were then determined using the \"Web of Science\" application. The inclusion criteria and results of each of these studies were examined for the exclusion of elderly patients, median patient age, and age range. RESULTS: A total of 248 trials were reviewed. Among the 100 most cited trials, 33% specifically excluded elderly patients in their trial design (age exclusion ranged from>65 to>75 years of age). The average-reported patient median age in these trials was 60.9 years. The average age for trials that did not exclude elderly patients was not significantly different at 61.0 (p = 0.97). The average median age of patients was 61 years (95% confidence interval (CI): 60.4-61.6) in all trials.",

Differences in patients, disease, investigation and treatment are thought to account for some survival shortfalls but it is not known whether differences in collection or processing of data also contribute. METHODOLOGY: We searched recognised sources where information regarding mortality rates have been published for the United Kingdom, Europe and United States (US). Data regarding patient selection, demographics and mortality rates were extracted. RESULTS: Published international 5-year survival for patients with lung cancer varies from 5% to 16%. The survival figures quoted in the literature are based on data which varies widely in its collection and statistical analysis and this information is not always in the public domain. Data from the US suggests an overall 5-year survival rate of up to 16% although this figure covers only a quarter of the general population and excludes patients without histological confirmation. Many European countries report higher mortality rates although in most, data includes patients without proven histology. European datasets have variable population coverage.",

Our study examined the relationship between two different systems employed to assess academic performance and the levels of stress among students at two different medical schools in Karachi, Pakistan. METHODS: A sample consisting of 387 medical students enrolled in pre-clinical years was taken from two universities, one employing the semester examination system with grade point average (GPA) scores (a tiered system) and the other employing an annual examination system with only pass/fail grading. A pre-designed, self-administered questionnaire was distributed. Test anxiety levels were assessed by The Westside Test Anxiety Scale (WTAS). Overall stress was evaluated using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). RESULTS: There were 82 males and 301 females while four did not respond to the gender question. The mean age of the entire cohort was 19.7 \u00b1 1.0 years. A total of 98 participants were from the pass/fail assessment system while 289 were from the GPA system. There was a higher proportion of females in the GPA system (85% vs. 59%; p<0.01). Students in the pass/fail assessment system had a lower score on the WTAS (2.4 \u00b1 0.8 vs. 2.8 \u00b1 0.7; p = 0.01) and the PSS (17.0 \u00b1 6.7 vs. 20.3 \u00b1 6.8; p<0.01), indicating lower levels of test anxiety and overall stress than in students enrolled in the GPA assessment system.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: There is growing concern about alcohol-related harm, particularly within Scotland which has some of the highest rates of alcohol-related death in western Europe. There are large gender differences in alcohol-related mortality rates in Scotland and in other countries, but the reasons for these differences are not clearly understood. In this paper, we aimed to address calls in the literature for further research on gender differences in the causes, contexts and consequences of alcohol-related harm. Our primary research question was whether the kind of social environment which tends to produce higher or lower rates of alcohol-related mortality is the same for both men and women across Scotland. METHODS: Cross-sectional, ecological design. A comparison was made between spatial variation in men's and women's age-standardised alcohol-related mortality rates in Scotland using maps, Moran's Index, linear regression and spatial analyses of residuals. Directly standardised mortality rates were derived from individual level records of death registration, 2000-2005 (n = 8685). RESULTS: As expected, men's alcohol-related mortality rate substantially exceeded women's and there was substantial spatial variation in these rates for both men and women within Scotland. However, there was little spatial variation in the relationship between men's and women's alcohol-mortality rates (r2 = 0.73); areas with relatively high rates of alcohol-related mortality for men tended also to have relatively high rates for women. In a small number of areas (8 out of 144) the relationship between men's and women's alcohol-related mortality rates was significantly different.",

We compare simple and complex scoring systems and evaluate the usefulness of the combination of the Clock Drawing Test with the Mini-Mental State Examination to detect patients with mild cognitive impairment. METHOD: Patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (n = 48) and age- and education-matched controls (n = 48) underwent neuropsychological examinations, including the Clock Drawing Test and the Mini-Mental State Examination. Clock drawings were scored by three blinded raters using one simple (6-point scale) and two complex (17- and 18-point scales) systems. The sensitivity and specificity of these scoring systems used alone and in combination with the Mini-Mental State Examination were determined. RESULTS: Complex scoring systems, but not the simple scoring system, were significant predictors of the amnestic mild cognitive impairment diagnosis in logistic regression analysis. At equal levels of sensitivity (87.5%), the Mini-Mental State Examination showed higher specificity (31.3%, compared with 12.5% for the 17-point Clock Drawing Test scoring scale). The combination of Clock Drawing Test and Mini-Mental State Examination scores increased the area under the curve (0.72; p<.001) and increased specificity (43.8%), but did not increase sensitivity, which remained high (85.4%).",

STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective laboratory/chart review of 24-hour urine collections at British Columbia Women's Hospital. Completeness was assessed by 24-hour urinary creatinine excretion (UcreatV): expected according to maternal weight for single collections and between-measurement difference for serial collections. RESULTS: For 198 randomly selected pregnant women with a hypertensive disorder (63% preeclampsia), 24-hour urine collections were frequently inaccurate (13-54%) on the basis of UcreatV of 97-220 micromol/kg per day (11.0-25.0 mg/kg per day) or 133-177 micromol/kg per day (15.1-20.1 mg/kg per day) of prepregnancy weight (respectively). Lean body weight resulted in more inaccurate collections (24-68%). The current weight was frequently unavailable (28%) and thus not used. For 161 women (81% proteinuric) with serial 24-hour urine levels, a median [interquartile range] of 11 [5-31]days apart, between-measurement difference in UcreatV was 14.4% [6.0-24.9]; 40 women (24.8%) had values 25% or greater, exceeding analytic and biologic variation.",

SAMPLE: Two hundred consecutive women undergoing colposcopy for the first time for a cervical cytological abnormality of severity no greater than moderate dyskaryosis. METHODS: Women were randomised into one of two groups (leaflet or control). Those in the leaflet group were sent an information leaflet prior to attending the clinic. In the colposcopy clinic all the women completed a State/Trait Anxiety Inventory (StAI/TrAI) and a modified psychosexual questionnaire before undergoing colposcopy. This was repeated at the six-month follow up visit. Women in the leaflet group also completed a further questionnaire on the leaflet. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Differences of anxiety and psychosexual scores between leaflet and control groups. RESULTS: The leaflet was well received. There were no statistical differences in StAI and TrAI scores between the study group and the control group at either visit, although in the whole study population StAI and TrAI scores were reduced at the second visit. The leaflet group had significantly more psychosexual problems but by the second visit, the scores had improved and the two groups were similar.

Erosion into the gastric wall by these devices remains a problem. A soft resiliant prosthesis of animal origin, constituted by a network of non-absorbable collagen fibres, may be a solution to this problem. This study assessed, in a porcine model, the histological reaction of the gastric wall following apposition of a band of porcine collagen (Pelvicol, Bard). METHODS: 15 female pigs weighing on average 21 kg underwent vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG). Stoma control was achieved with a band of porcine collagen (2 cm wide, 7 cm long and 2 mm thick). The pigs were sacrificed 1 month after VBG, and histological analysis was performed at a macroscopic and microscopic level. RESULTS: There was no peri-operative death, although 2 pigs died in the postoperative period (the first case developed a bowel fistula and sepsis, and the second pig died of unrelated causes). There were 2 additional morbidities (gastric fistula on the linear staple-line away from the Pelvicol band) that led to an early euthanasia of 2 pigs. Post-mortem macroscopic analyses in the remaining 11 pigs did not reveal migration of the device, and there was no tissue reaction on postoperative microscopic analyses. 10 of the pigs had lost weight at 1 month, averaging 3.42 kg.",

In the last years it has become a fact that tumor growth is angiogenesis-dependent. Therefore, inhibitors of angiogenesis are a new class of antineoplastic substances with a novel mechanism of action that might be a powerful complement to conventional cytostatic therapy. SUBSTANCES AND CLINICAL TRIALS: Inhibitors of tumor-angiogenesis which have entered clinical trials, with their results published until December 1998 are discussed here. Most results originate from phase-I or phase-II clinical trials. They are discussed and compared in respect to toxicity and response. Also some substances with high therapeutic potential which are still in preclinical testing are discussed. RESULTS: Many of the investigated angiogenesis inhibitors demonstrated anti-tumor effects in phase-I or phase-II clinical trials. The commonest manifestation was stable disease, followed by partial remissions. In a few cases, complete remissions were observed. The toxicities of these substances differ both in type and degree of side effects.",

Gestational weight gain, which is associated negatively with PCB levels in maternal and cord blood, and positively with birth weight, could substantially confound this association. OBJECTIVE: We sought to estimate the influence of gestational weight gain on the association between PCB-153 exposure and birth weight using a pharmacokinetic model. METHODS: We modified a recently published pharmacokinetic model and ran Monte Carlo simulations accounting for variability in physiologic parameters and their correlations. We evaluated the pharmacokinetic model by comparing simulated plasma PCB-153 levels during pregnancy to serial measurements in 10 pregnant women from another study population. We estimated the association between simulated plasma PCB-153 levels and birth weight using linear regression models. RESULTS: The plasma PCB-153 level profiles generated with the pharmacokinetic model were comparable to measured levels in 10 pregnant women. We estimated a 118-g decrease in birth weight (95% CI: -129, -106 g) for each 1-\u03bcg/L increase in simulated cord plasma PCB-153, compared with the 150-g decrease estimated based on the previous meta-analysis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: DVT was induced in both hind limbs of five pigs. Thirty minutes later, bilateral thrombolysis was performed by using infusion guidewires placed coaxially through occlusion balloon catheters. A temporary venous filter was then placed in the inferior vena cava. The balloon catheters and infusion wire were removed, a 14-F sheath was placed on the right side, and aspiration of residual thrombi was attempted with 8- and 6-F catheters. At autopsy, the mass of any thrombus in the iliofemoral veins was measured, and residual thrombosis in the venous tributaries was graded at four sites. Thromboemboli in the inferior vena cava and the pulmonary circulation were also collected and weighed. RESULTS: With aspiration and lysis, the iliofemoral veins were cleared of thrombus in three of five limbs; from the remaining two, only 0.09 and 0.15 g of thrombus were harvested. Except for the deep femoral vein in two legs, tributaries were free of thrombus. After thrombolysis alone, thrombi ranged in mass from 0.54 to 1.14 g (median, 0.70 g). Some thrombi were observed in most tributaries. One or two small emboli were found trapped by the caval filter and in the pulmonary circulation in four and three pigs, respectively.",

METHODS: An economic evaluation technique, discrete choice analysis, was administered in a survey to a sample of a German general public Internet panel, representative in terms of age, gender and education. Responders were asked to choose their preferred provider of surgical care in a series of pairwise choices, defined by five attributes. Regression analysis was used to quantify preferences towards characteristics of care and to calculate utilities of treatment scenarios. The strength of preferences and the rate at which participants were willing to trade among attributes were estimated. RESULTS: The response rate was 76% (n=1134). 'Specialization and experience of provider' was the single most important attribute, followed by 'waiting times' and 'staff continuity'. Subjects traded a 4-week waiting time to obtain surgery at a highly specialized institution.

        "input": "INTRODUCTION: Observational studies of influenza vaccine effectiveness often study persons seeking medical care for acute respiratory infection (ARI). We conducted a pilot study to determine if vaccine effectiveness could be estimated in the general population with a novel rolling cross-sectional survey sampling design and laboratory confirmation of influenza. METHODS: Cross-sectional samples were selected weekly from defined populations in Marshfield, Wisconsin and Monroe County, New York from January through April, 2011 (12 weeks). Persons were telephoned and asked about the occurrence of ARI in the past week. Nasal and throat swabs were obtained from consenting individuals with ARI and tested by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was defined as (100\u00d7[1-OR]) for vaccination in a logistic regression model that adjusted for age, calendar week, and site. The comparison group included all study participants without RT-PCR confirmed influenza, including those who were not ill. RESULTS: Study personnel contacted 9537 (62%) of 15,303 persons sampled; the primary analysis included 5678 subjects. Of these, 193 (3%) reported an ARI and agreed to be tested for influenza; 13 (7%) were influenza positive. The adjusted effectiveness of the influenza vaccine was 1% (95% confidence limits -239-70%).",

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the degree to which the medical humanities have been integrated into the fields of internal medicine and psychiatry, the authors assessed the presence of medical humanities articles in selected psychiatry and internal medicine journals from 1950 to 2000. METHODS: The journals searched were the three highest-ranking psychiatry and internal medicine journals on the Institute for Scientific Information's Impact Factor rankings that were published in English and aimed at a clinical audience. Operationalized criteria defining the medical humanities allowed the percentage of text in the selected journals constituting medical humanities to be quantified. Journals were hand searched at 10-year intervals from 1950 to 2000. Mixed effects models were used to describe the change in medical humanities over time. RESULTS: The percentage of text within psychiatry journals meeting the criteria for medical humanities declined from a peak of 17% in 1970 to a low of 2% in 2000, while the percentage of humanities articles in internal medicine journals roughly doubled from 5% to 11% over the same time period. A linear model increasing over time best fit the medical humanities in the internal medicine journals, while a cubic model decreasing over time best fit the psychiatry humanities data. Humanities articles in medical journals had a greater breadth and diversity than those in psychiatry journals.",
        "output": "The medical humanities have been steadily declining in psychiatry journals since the 1970s, while internal medicine journals have been increasing their presence of medical humanities over the same time period.

In the selected cases, this has been used as the sole treatment. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of complete pathological response for patients receiving CRT in one centre in the UK. METHOD: Patients receiving 6 weeks of neoadjuvant CRT were identified using the two cancer audit databases in two different tertiary hospitals from January 2002 to November 2007. Pathology was reviewed and the histopathological response of the resected specimen to CRT was evaluated using the Mandard classification (1 = complete response, 5 = no response) RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-two consecutive patients [median age 61 (range 44-86) years, 90 men] with nonmetastatic locally advanced rectal cancer received neoadjuvant chemo radiotherapy between 2002 and 2007 followed by resection of the tumour. Data were available from 129 patients.",
        "output": "The frequency of complete pathological response was 44.4% (61/129). The median time to resection was 12 weeks (range 8-16 weeks). The median number of cycles of CRT was 6 (range 4-8). The median number of cycles of chemotherapy was 6 (range 4-8). The most common regimen was FOLFOX (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin). The most common grade of response was 4 (61/61). The median overall survival was 12.8 months (range 8.2-21.2 months). The 1-year overall survival was 82.4%. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of complete pathological response to neoadjuvant CRT in locally advanced rectal cancer is similar to that reported in Brazil. The median time to resection and the median number of cycles of CRT were similar to those reported in the literature. The most common regimen used was FOLFOX. The median overall survival and 1-year overall survival were also similar to those reported in the literature."

CASE DESCRIPTION: A 31-year-old man was admitted at the author's institution. The patient has had 1-year history of cervical pain, progressive quadriplegia, and bladder disturbances. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an enhanced cervical intradural extramedullary tumor extending from the bulbomedullary junction to the C3 level, with severe spinal cord compression. Emergency surgical resection was performed, and a total removal of the lesion was accomplished. One year and half later, a local recurrence associated to a small cerebellar lesion was noticed justifying a second spinal intervention. Both surgical interventions demonstrated an intradural extramedullary ependymoma without attachment to the spinal cord or to the dura mater. Adjuvant craniospinal radiotherapy was recommended to the patient.",

Factors predicting durable fixation are not clearly understood, but we presumed bone ingrowth could be enhanced by the quantity of host bone and application of autograft bone chips.QUESTIONS/ PURPOSES: We asked: (1) Did the amount of bone ingrowth exceed the amount of periprosthetic and host bone with the addition of autograft bone chips? (2) Did the amount of bone ingrowth increase with implantation time? And (3) did osteolysis along the porous-coated interface and screw tracts progress with implantation time? METHODS: We measured the amount of bone in the porous-coated, periprosthetic, and host bone regions in 19 postmortem retrieved cementless primary total knee implants. The amount of bone in apposition to the implant surface, and alternatively lysed bone, was analyzed radiographically to assess the progression of osteolysis. RESULTS: While bone ingrowth tended to be less than periprosthetic and host bone in all three components, it was only significantly less in the patellar component. Bone ingrowth increased in all three components over time, but progression of osteolysis did not.",

METHODS: Seventy patients undergoing RBA for cataract surgery were enrolled in a prospective, double-blind trial. They were allocated randomly to receive 5 ml either warm (37 degrees C) or cold (20 degrees C) anesthetic solution for RBA. Additionally, O'Brien's method was used to create an akinesia of the orbicularis oculi muscle. The following data were collected before and 20 minutes after retrobulbar injection: pain of injection, eye motility (Kestenbaum test), and corneal sensitivity (0: no sensitivity; 1: sensitivity remaining) at four different sites. The pain of injection was registered using an ordinal analogous scale before and immediately after the injection. Furthermore, data acquisition included any possible side effects and the bulbar length, measured with ultrasound. RESULTS: The score for injection pain (4.5 +/- 2.3 points), horizontal eye motility (0.2 +/- 0.8 mm), vertical eye motility (0.9 +/- 2.1 mm) all were lower for the warm group in comparison to the cold group (average pain score: 5.2 +/- 2.6 points; horizontal eye motility: 0.7 +/- 1.6 mm; vertical eye motility: 1.2 +/- 2.0 mm).

More information is needed about whether they are true risk factors and independently predict the development of suicidal ideation. METHOD: A sample of the general population from Eastern Finland (n = 1,339) was followed-up for three-years with baseline and two follow-up assessments using postal questionnaires. The main adverse life events and changes in lifestyles were screened at baseline and on one- and three-year follow-up. The Beck Depression Inventory was used to assess the level of depression and the presence of suicidal ideation. RESULTS: Suicidal ideation was common in the sample (annual incidence 4.3%).

(iii) To evaluate evidence that the degree of communication between the outdoor smoking area and indoor areas influences the level of particulates indoors. METHODS: We measured fine particulate levels (PM(2.5)) using portable real-time aerosol monitors in a convenience sample of seven pubs and bars in central Wellington City. This was on one to three occasions (12 measurements in total) over four different nights. RESULTS: On the first two nights, when there was no or infrequent communication between the outdoor and indoor areas, the mean level of PM(2.5) varied from 32 to 109 \u03bcg/m\u00b3 in the outdoor smoking area, and from 14 to 79 \u03bcg/m\u00b3 in the adjacent indoor areas.

We discuss a putative causative link between this syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis. CASE REPORT: A seven-year-old girl presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An extensive immunological work-up was normal.",

A number of different therapies are prescribed to control the disease. This survey-based study was carried out to assess patients' and physicians' perceptions of GERD and its treatment. METHODS: Randomly selected general practitioners (GPs) from five countries (USA, UK, Japan, Germany and France) took part in a faceto-face interview, using a standard questionnaire, concerning the last four GERD patients (those taking GERD medication) who had consulted them and who consented to be interviewed. Those patients were then interviewed via telephone, also using a standard questionnaire. RESULTS: Completed questionnaires were available for 927 of the 1044 patients who were identified. The mean length of time that patients suffered GERD symptoms prior to consultation was more than 1.5 years, with 52.3% of those consulting a GP stating the reason they sought medical attention was that 'symptoms were too uncomfortable to bear'. Only 36% of patients receiving prescription therapy reported that they were currently asymptomatic; 20.5% of patients were also taking at least one over-the-counter (OTC) medication.",

In countries such as the USA, the economic impact of COPD exceeds that of many chronic conditions. There is a paucity of data on the economic burden of COPD in Japan. METHODOLOGY: Based upon publicly available information, a prevalence-based approach was used to construct a deterministic model to estimate the total direct and indirect costs of care for COPD in Japan. Data sources included a spirometry-based epidemiological study, the peer-reviewed literature, and governmental and industrial surveys. The most current data that addressed direct and indirect costs of care were utilized. RESULTS: In Japan, the estimated total cost of COPD is 805.5 billion yen (US 6.8 billion dollars) per year; 645.1 billion yen (US 5.5 billion dollars) in direct costs and 160.4 billion yen (US 1.4 billion dollars) in indirect costs. In direct costs, inpatient care accounted for 244.1 billion yen (US 2.1 billion dollars), outpatient care 299.3 billion yen (US 2.5 billion dollars), and home oxygen therapy 101.7 billion yen (US 0.9 billion dollars).

STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, randomized, single blinded study was conducted on a sample of 39 children between 3 and 15 years of age. After dissection and snare tonsillectomy, the tonsillar fossa was covered on one side using the palatopharyngus mucosa and the other side is used as control. Pain scores, healing, edema and infection at the operation site were investigated. METHODS: The tonsillectomy sites were randomly assigned into one of two groups. First group contained the ones with mucosal flap sealed over the operation site and the second group was kept as control with the operation site left uncovered. All of the patients received mild analgesics. The pain assessment is done on Days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 postoperatively, by using Wong-Baker faces visual analog scale. On the 10th postoperative day, the operation field of each side is scored separately for edema, healing and infection. Statistical investigation was performed through a software program. RESULTS: On first postoperative day, pain level difference was not statistically significant between the two groups (p>0.01). But from 3rd to 10th postoperative day, the pain level was found out to be lower in the mucosa sealed site (p<0.01). On the 10th postoperative day, while the edema was significantly more (p<0.01), healing was better (p<0.01) at the sutured site. Postoperative infection at operation site was not different between the groups (p>0.01).",

The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of increasing turnover in pediatric anaesthetic cases by use of sevoflurane in comparison with halothane. Often short cases or day cases need rapid turnover. METHODS AND PATIENTS: The pediatric patients aged 4-14 years (ASA I) presenting for elective ophthalmic surgery were randomised to either the halothane or the sevoflurane group. Standard monitoring was applied to all patients, in addition the pEEG was used to determine comparable anaesthetic depth. Sevoflurane or halothane were titrated to a SEF 90 of 8-12 Hz. Management of the airway was done with the RLMA (reinforced laryngeal mask). All patients were under controlled ventilation. At the end of surgery and anaesthesia 3 time intervals were measured: phase I) end of anaesthetic application--start of spontaneous respiration; phase II) start of spontaneous respiration--removal of RLMA. The SEF 90 interval was also assessed. RESULTS: 18 cases were included (halo n = 8/sevo n = 10, no significant differences concerning weight, age, anaesthesia time). There is a significant advantage for the Sevoflurane group in phase II of 6.8 minutes. No differences were seen in phase I and SEF 90 interval.",
        "output": "Yes, sevoflurane can save time in routine clinical use. In this study, sevoflurane was found to reduce the time needed for spontaneous respiration after anesthesia by 6.8 minutes compared to halothane. This suggests that sevoflurane may be beneficial in reducing turnover time in pediatric anesthetic cases."

OBSERVATION: A 62-year-old woman developed ascendant progressive paresthesia and weakness of arms and legs, 48 hours after enteritis infection. Neurological examination showed tetraparesia with loss of deep tendon reflexes and alteration of proprioception tests. Nerve conduction studies revealed polyradiculoneuritis. Then she presented an acute blindness and hypertension. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed bilateral occipital lesions and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed an elevated protein level (1.54 g/l) and red blood cells without meningitis. Brain arteriography was normal. Intravenous immunoglobulins improved neurological symptoms.",
        "output": "Yes, cortical blindness can be a complication of Guillain-Barre syndrome. It is believed to be caused by an autoimmune response, in which the body's immune system attacks the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, leading to a loss of vision. In this case, the patient presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage and regressive occipital white matter lesions, which suggests that the autoimmune response may have been triggered by the enteritis infection."

The authors evaluated albumin as a nutrition parameter, comparing it with more specific anthropometric parameters. METHODS: The study included a cohort of 271 patients. The analysis involved data obtained after patients entered the study (1994-2004). Anthropometric measurements included skinfolds, mid-arm circumference, mid-arm muscle circumference, percentage of body fat, body mass index, body height, and dry weight. Kt/V and normalized protein catabolic rate were also determined and laboratory analyses undertaken. RESULTS: Serum albumin was only weakly correlated with mid-arm circumference (r = 0.12), mid-arm muscle circumference (r = 0.15), and fat-free mass (r = 0.12). Common factor analysis of nutrition parameters uncovered latent variables, but serum albumin was not associated strongly with them. The sensitivity of albumin in detecting malnutrition was 24%, with a specificity of 88% and a predictive value of 74%. Graphic analysis showed disagreement in albumin levels with percentage of body fat and mid-arm muscle circumference.",

In this study we hypothesized that left atrial volume (LAV), which is known to predict exercise capacity in patients with various cardiac pathologies including heart failure and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is associated with limited exercise capacity of HT recipients. METHODS: We analyzed 50 patients [age 57 \u00b12 (SEM), 12 females] who had a post-HT echocardiography and cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPX) within 9 weeks time at clinic follow up. The change in LAV (\u0394LAV) was also computed as the difference in LAV from the preceding one-year to the study echocardiogram. Correlations among the measured parameters were assessed with a Pearson's correlation analysis. RESULTS: LAV (n = 50) and \u0394LAV (n = 40) indexed to body surface area were 40.6 \u00b1 11.5 ml\u00b7m-2 and 1.9 \u00b1 8.5 ml\u00b7m-2\u00b7year-1, data are mean \u00b1 SD, respectively.

We discuss the validity of conservative therapy for thrombosed type A dissection and examine the relationship between the morphology of the dissecting aorta and its operative indications. METHODS: Subjects were 28 patients with acute type A aortic dissection in which the false lumen was totally thrombosed who were transferred to our hospital in the acute phase between 1990 and 2002. We performed medical therapy on all of them at first. We calculated the ratio of the false lumen and the true lumen (F/T) by enhanced computed tomography scan at the onset. The maximum aneurysmal size was measured approximately every week. RESULTS: Fifteen of them needed surgical repair; six in the acute phase and nine in chronic. One-year and 5-year survival rate for the operative and the non-operative group are 93.3, 80.0 and 92.3, 92.3% respectively. The mean F/T was 30% in the operative group and 50% in the non-operative group (p = 0.04). There was almost no reduction in size in the operative group during the follow up (-0.5 +/- 1.2 mm).",

Although public schools strive to meet the needs of parents who, as taxpayers, fund the educational system, little is known about parental desires regarding sexuality education in states with mandated abstinence education. The objective of this study was to assess parental opinion about sexuality education in public schools in North Carolina, a state with mandated abstinence education. METHODS: Computer-assisted, anonymous, cross-sectional telephone surveys were conducted among 1306 parents of North Carolina public school students in grades K-12. Parental support for sexuality education in public schools and 20 sexuality education topics was measured. We defined comprehensive sexuality education as education that includes a discussion of how to use and talk about contraception with partners. RESULTS: Parents in North Carolina overwhelmingly support sexuality education in public schools (91%). Of these respondents, the majority (89%) support comprehensive sexuality education. Less than a quarter of parents oppose teaching any specific topic, including those typically viewed as more controversial, such as discussions about sexual orientation, oral sex, and anal sex. Parents' level of education was inversely related to support for specific sexuality education topics and comprehensive education, although these differences were small in magnitude. More than 90% of respondents felt that parents and public health professionals should determine sexuality education content and opposed the involvement of politicians.",

With early conservative management, most patients have a good prognosis and heal within weeks to months after the initial trauma. Occasionally, persisting symptoms make a surgical intervention with coccygectomy necessary. METHODS: We report on the results of patients surgically managed for traumatically induced, persisting coccygodynia and compare these to patients operatively treated for idiopathic coccygodynia. Sixteen patients with an average follow-up of 7.3 years were evaluated. Of these, eight were surgically treated for traumatic and eight for idiopathic coccygodynia. The clinical results were assessed by means of the Hambly Score and the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability questionnaire. Patient satisfaction with the postoperative result was assessed by a visual analog scale. RESULTS: Seven of eight (88%) patients treated for traumatically induced coccygodynia had a good or excellent postoperative result, in contrast to only three of eight (38%) patients with idiopathic coccygodynia. The former group had better results in terms of sitting tolerance and general pain intensity as represented by the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability questionnaire. According to the significantly better clinical results, personal satisfaction was clearly higher in the traumatic group.",

Therefore, surgical intervention is more likely to provide a better outcome."

The aim of our project was to assess the discrepancies between methods of dynamic autoregulation testing based on CPP or ABP, and study possible differences in their prognostic value. METHOD: Intermittent recordings of intracranial pressure (ICP), ABP and middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (FV) waveforms were made in 151 anaesthetised and ventilated adult head injured patients as part of their required care. Indices of dynamic autoregulation were calculated as a moving correlation coefficient of 60 samples (total time 3 min) of 6 s mean values of FV and ABP (Mxa) or FV and CPP (Mx). Values of Mx and Mxa were averaged over multiple recordings in each patient and correlated with outcome at 6 months post injury. FINDINGS: Association between Mx and Mxa was moderately strong (r(2) = 0.73). However, limit of 95% accordance between both indices was +/-0.32. Mxa was significantly greater than Mx (0.22 +/- 0.22 versus 0.062 +/- 0.28; p<0.000001). The difference between Mx and Mxa decreased with impairment of autoregulation (r = -0.39; p<0.000001).

        "input": "BACKGROUND: The benefits of adding chemotherapy to surgery in patients with hepatic colorectal metastases at moderate and high risk for recurrence and the optimal sequence of administration are undetermined. METHODS: We followed the overall-survival and event-free survival rates after operation in patients with resectable colorectal metastases confined to the liver. The adjuvant patients first underwent surgery and then treatment, whereas the neoadjuvant patients underwent treatment, surgery, and re-treatment. Assignment was by oncologist and patient preferences. Chemotherapy was oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or irinotecan (FOLFIRI) based. RESULTS: Fifty-six of 105 patients who underwent liver resections for colorectal metastases (2002-2005) are included. The two groups were comparable for demographics, characteristics of disease (including recurrence risk), treatment protocols, and follow-up. The respective 1-, 2-, and 3-year overall survival rates were 91%, 91%, and 84%, and the event-free survival rates were 63%, 49%, and 49% for the 19 adjuvant patients, and 95%, 91%, and 70%, and 94%, 50%, and 50% for the 37 neoadjuvant patients.",

METHODS: Questionnaire-based, multi-stage cluster sampling technique was used as the design,in which 124 doctors, 154 certified nurses and 15 hospital managers participated. RESULTS: Only 39% of doctors and 51% of nurses were aware of the manager's basic degree and 70% of them considered it inadequate. Health sciences were chosen as the best basic degree for effective management by 65% of health practitioners. Moreover, 74% of doctors and 96% of nurses believed that an interdisciplinary board of directors, with the manager acting as a chairman could be the ideal administrative model. Even though this model was the current system in the interviewed hospitals, most health practitioners (87%) considered it ineffective. With regard to the acceptance of the manager as authority in the hospital, 76% of the doctors believed that there were related problems (47% considered the manager as an outsider to the health sector), whereas only 45% of the managers admitted such problems. Trainees showed a less tolerant attitude towards managerial administration in comparison to specialists.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Ultraviolet (UV) radiation (UVR) interacts with chromophores in cutaneous cells with consequent antigenicity. The normal response to this is a downregulation of immune responsiveness. Failure of the immune system to downregulate and to ignore transient photoantigens in human skin results in polymorphic light eruption (PLE), the commonest of the photodermatoses. UVR initiates and promotes skin cancer (SC): UV-induced immunosuppression permits the expansion of UV-mutated clones of cells which ultimately lead to SC. OBJECTIVES: Because there is increased immune surveillance and resistance to immune suppression following UVR exposure in PLE one might expect a protective effect of PLE against SC and, conversely, a reduced risk of PLE among patients with SC. METHODS: We therefore constructed a prospective case-control study to see if this were the case. Two groups were studied: a group comprising 214 patients with SC and 210 gender- and aged-matched controls, and a group comprising 100 patients with PLE and 155 gender- and aged-matched controls. Each participant answered a questionnaire aimed at establishing personal and family history of SC and photodermatoses. Skin type and exposure to UVR were also documented. RESULTS: The prevalence of PLE in people with SC was 7.5%, compared with 21.4% for controls (P<0.001). The prevalence of SC in patients with PLE was 4% compared with 7.1% for controls.",

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to critically review a nonpediatric hospital-based call center with the aim of identifying the algorithms responsible for the majority of nonessential referrals. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study performed at a tertiary medical care facility over 1 year. Telephone triage forms of children and adolescents younger than 18 years, exclusively referred by triage nurses using the Barton Schmitt protocols, were reviewed, and their ED course was evaluated by consulting the electronic medical record. \"Essential\" referrals to the ED were classified as presentations warranting immediate evaluation or referrals requiring \"essential interventions\" such as serum laboratory tests, imaging, complex procedures, intravenous medications, subspecialty consultation, or admission. RESULTS: A total of 220 patients were included in this study. Of these, 73 (33%) were classified as nonessential, whereas 147 (67%) were classified as essential. Nonessential patients were significantly younger compared with essential referrals (P<0.05). They also had lower triage scores (P = 0.026) and shorter ED stays (P<0.0001). The algorithms for \"fever-3 months or older\" (12.3%), \"vomiting without diarrhea\" (8.2%), \"trauma-head\" (8.2%), \"headache\" (6.8%), and \"sore throat\" (5.5%) were determined most likely to result in a nonessential referral.",

However, antidepressant discontinuation may increase the risk of a new episode of major depressive disorder. We sought to estimate differences in the risk of developing a new major depressive episode among pregnant and postpartum women with recurrent illness who either did or did not use antidepressants. METHODS: Participants were recruited from obstetrical settings; we analyzed a subgroup of 778 women with a history of a depressive disorder. Diagnoses were determined by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview administered twice in pregnancy and once after delivery. We used Cox Regression to model onset of a major depressive episode with a time-dependent predictor of antidepressant use. RESULTS: There was no clear difference in risk of a major depressive episode between women who took antidepressants and women who did not (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.51-1.50). After accounting for antidepressant use, clearly hazardous factors included 4 or more depressive episodes before pregnancy (HR = 1.97; 95% CI = 1.09-3.57), black race (HR = 3.69; 95% CI = 2.16-6.30), and Hispanic ethnicity (HR = 2.33; 95% CI = 1.47-3.69).",

METHODS: The study evaluated the endometrial features of 441 naturally conceived and asymptomatic first trimester (99 tubal ectopic, 138 failing and 264 normal intrauterine) with maternal serum beta HCG levels<or=1,000 mIU/mL and indeterminate sonographic findings. RESULTS: Tubal ectopic, failing intrauterine and normal intrauterine pregnancies are statistically similar in aspect of endometrial thickness. However, trilaminar endometrial pattern was significantly less frequent in failing and normal intrauterine pregnancies but significantly more frequent in ruptured tubal pregnancies. Also the relative risk of tubal rupture is significantly higher in case of trilaminar endometrial pattern. Trilaminar endometrial pattern has a sensitivity of 21.2%, specificity of 93.9%, positive predictive value of 50.0% and negative predictive value of 80.5% for distinguishing tubal ectopic pregnancy.

Does the same set of variables predict intention equally strong throughout the donor career? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Measures of intention, self-efficacy, cognitive and affective attitude, and subjective and moral norms were assessed within a sample of 11,480 whole blood donors. Donors were categorized into 65 donation classes using their LND; for example, all donors with one donation (n = 483) in the first donation class, all donors with two donations (n = 447) in the second donation class, and so on. For each donation class, separately for men and women, linear multiple regression models for intention were fitted using self-efficacy, cognitive attitude, affective attitude, subjective norm, and moral norm as predictor variables. RESULTS: During all stages of the donor career, self-efficacy is the main predictor of intention, with a relatively constant beta (\u03b2 = 0.64, p<0.001). Cognitive attitude (\u03b2 = 0.1, p<0.001) and moral norm (\u03b2 = 0.10, p<0.001) contributed marginally to the prediction.

Family physicians had fewer resuscitation and stabilization items than pediatricians (5.7 vs 8.6 items, P<.001) and were less prepared in terms of PALS training (19% vs 51%, P<.001). Those with PALS training were more likely to have an intraosseous needle and Broselow tape and to have conducted a mock code. Family physicians considered it is less important than pediatricians to provide such care or to be prepared to do so.",
        "output": "Yes, family physicians are as prepared as pediatricians in terms of responding to pediatric emergencies, with the exception of having access to more resuscitation and stabilization items. Family physicians consider it less important to provide such care and to be prepared to do so."

        "input": "AIMS: An impaired oxidative/antioxidative status plays an important role in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the levels of the novel marker ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) and albumin-adjusted IMA (Adj-IMA) in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and look for the associations of these with the total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), and oxidative stress index (OSI). METHODS: Forty patients with CRC (19 females and 21 males; mean age, 56.5\u00b12.1 years) and 39 age- and sex-matched healthy people (22 females and 17 males; mean age, 56.0\u00b11.7 years) were included in this study. Serum levels of IMA, TAS, and TOS were analyzed, and the OSI was calculated. RESULTS: Serum IMA, TOS, and OSI levels were significantly higher in patients with CRC than in controls (p<0.0001), whereas TAS levels were significantly lower in CRC patients (p=0.03). There was no significant difference in serum Adj-IMA levels between groups (p=0.32).",
        "output": "The results of this study suggest that IMA, TOS, and OSI could be useful markers for the assessment of oxidative stress in CRC patients. Further studies are needed to validate these findings and to investigate the potential role of IMA in the pathogenesis of CRC."

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Multiple endocrine neoplasia 2B (MEN2B) has a classic childhood phenotypic presentation characterized by mucosal neuromas and marfanoid habitus. However, the diagnosis of MEN2B is often delayed beyond childhood, at which time medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) may be regionally advanced or metastatic. We examined the extent of this delay and its impact on the treatment of MTC. METHODS: Patients in the MEN database were retrospectively analyzed to determine the age at first presentation for a MEN2B-related complaint and the subsequent time to correct diagnosis. Operative and pathology reports were reviewed to determine the extent of thyroidectomy and cervical lymphadenectomy during the initial and subsequent neck operations. RESULTS: We identified 22 patients with MEN2B, 20 were de novo cases and a M918T RET gene mutation was confirmed in 18 of the 22 patients. Median age at diagnosis of MTC was 13 years (range 6-25 years). The median delay in diagnosis was 26 months (range 0-18 years). Persistent local-regional MTC was present following the initial cervical operation in 12 of 22 patients (55%); including 4 of 13 with MEN2B diagnosed prior to initial surgery and 8 of 9 with MEN2B diagnosed after initial surgery.",

Persistent local-regional MTC was present following the initial cervical operation in 55% of cases, including 4 of 13 with MEN2B diagnosed prior to initial surgery and 8 of 9 with MEN2B diagnosed after initial surgery. These findings suggest that MEN2B is more common than we think and may be present at the time of initial presentation or develop later in the course of the disease."

        "input": "OBJECTIVES: To investigate the putative association between nocturia and decreased serum testosterone in men with lower urinary tract symptoms. METHODS: Frequency volume charts and serum testosterone levels of patients visiting the outpatient clinic for lower urinary tract symptoms were collected and analyzed. Age, prostate volume, body mass index and the presence of comorbidities were accounted for. Frequency volume charts were analyzed for pathophysiological components of nocturnal polyuria, global polyuria, decreased nocturnal bladder capacity and increased frequency to identify associated risks. Frequency volume charts were also used to chart 8-h changes of volume, frequency and capacity to identify time diurnal interactions with risk factors based on serum testosterone levels. RESULTS: A total of 2180 patients were enrolled in the study. Multivariate analysis showed testosterone decreased 0.142\u2009ng/mL for every increase in nocturia, independent of other factors. Logistic regression analysis showed a significant difference between pathophysiological components. Decreased testosterone was shown to carry a significant independent risk for overall nocturia (odds ratio 1.60, 95% confidence interval 1.013-2.527, P\u2009=\u20090.044), and particularly nocturnal polyuria (odds ratio 1.934, 95% confidence interval 1.001-3.737, P\u2009=\u20090.027).

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: Hand-held flushing of radial arterial lines at 0.5 ml/s in neonates can result in retrograde embolization of flush solution into the central arterial circulation. We studied flush flow velocities during intermittent arterial line purging using a flow regulating device with an infusion bag pump and a syringe pump system. MEASUREMENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: In this in vitro experiment we simulated flushing of a 24- and a 22-G cannula against a mean arterial pressure of 45 mmHg. Fluid flow velocities were gravimetrically measured during flushing from an infusion bag system pressurized to 100, 200, and 300 mmHg and from a syringe pump flush system after initialization of boluses of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 ml. The flow regulating device was opened for 1, 2, and 5 s. RESULTS: Both flush systems tested allowed delivery of flush flow velocities exceeding 0.5 ml/s (e.g., 22-G cannula; bag system, pressure 300 mmHg up to 0.64+/-0.08 ml/s; syringe pump, 2 ml bolus up to 0.74+/-0.05 ml/s). In syringe pump systems the main determinant of flow velocity was bolus size, in bag pump systems flushing time and bag pressure.",
        "output": "Flushing of radial arterial lines in neonates with a hand-held device and a pressurized bag pump or syringe pump system can result in retrograde embolization of flush solution into the central arterial circulation. The risk of embolization is higher with a pressurized bag pump system, as it allows for higher flush flow velocities. The syringe pump system should be preferred, as it allows for more precise control of flush flow velocity."

STUDY DESIGN: Observational study analyzing data from the 1995 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS, n = 15,590). Self-reported Pap smears, mammograms, and influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations were compared between groups with different levels of health-related difficulties in six activities of daily living (ADL). RESULTS: Compared to those without disabilities, the most severely disabled women (limitations in 5 or 6 ADL) reported fewer Pap smears (age<or =70, 23% vs 41%, p<.001) and mammograms (age>or = 50, 13% vs 44%, p<.001). In a controlled analysis, individuals with this high level of disability were 57% (95% confidence interval [CI], 33% to 72%) and 56% (95% CI, 43% to 76%) less likely to report receiving Pap smears and mammograms, respectively, compared with able-bodied women, regardless of their age, whether they were in an HMO, or whether they lived in a long-term care facility. Functional limitations were not a deterrent to receiving vaccinations. In general, patients in HMOs reported more procedures than those in fee-for-service, while those in long-term care facilities reported fewer procedures than those living in the community.",

Herein, we report on a series of adult patients who presented with agminated or solitary papules of the distal finger found on histologic examination to contain amorphous eosinophilic deposits. RESULTS: The eosinophilic deposits were found in close proximity to the overlying epithelium and devoid of apoptotic keratinocytes, plasma cells, or vascular thickening reminiscent of amyloidosis or hyalinosis cutis. Special and immunostains yielded eosinophilic material that was elastin and Protein P negative. Despite a similar histomorphologic appearance to colloid milium, typical clinical features of this entity were not present.",

The threat value of pain might be a decisive variable, which is not influenced alone by stimulus duration. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at comparing startle responses to tonic heat pain stimulation with varying degrees of threat. We hypothesized that the expectation of unpredictable temperature increases would evoke higher threat and thereby potentiate startle compared with the expectation of constant stimulation. METHODS: Healthy, pain-free subjects (n = 40) underwent painful stimulation in two conditions (low/high threat) in balanced order. The only difference between the two conditions was that in the high-threat condition 50% of the trials were announced to include a short further noxious temperature increase at the end. Startle tones were presented prior to this temperature increase still in the phase of anticipation. RESULTS: We observed startle potentiation in the high-threat compared with the low-threat condition, but only in those participants who took part first in the high-threat condition. Habituation could not account for these findings, as we detected no significant decline of startle responses in the course of both conditions.",
        "output": "The results of this study indicate that the threat value of pain modulates the startle reflex. Specifically, the expectation of unpredictable temperature increases evokes higher startle responses compared with the expectation of constant stimulation. This effect is only seen in participants who were first exposed to the high-threat condition. These findings suggest that the threat of pain can modulate the startle reflex and that this modulation is dependent on the individual's prior experience with threat."

Thus, it can be assumed that actions taken against such triggers may prevent the progression of the disease. However, limited data exist on the clinical importance of these triggers in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of triggers on symptoms and actions taken against certain modifiable triggers in patients with asthma and COPD. METHODS: The study was conducted in a university hospital between June 2009 and June 2010. Patients with asthma and COPD were asked to complete a questionnaire in which both the factors triggering symptoms and the actions taken against several triggers were assessed. RESULTS: Three hundred consecutive adult patients (150 asthma, 150 COPD) were enrolled to the study. The frequency of triggering factors was similar in both groups. Vaccination rates for influenza and pneumococcus were significantly higher in patients with COPD. However, such anti-allergic approaches as the use of strategies to decrease dust exposure, the use of anti-mite bed sheets, and the removal of pets from the home were more commonly employed by asthmatic patients.",
