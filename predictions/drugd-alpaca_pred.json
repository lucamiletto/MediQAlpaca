        "input": "BACKGROUND: Bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in resolving co-morbid conditions even in patients with a body mass index (BMI)<35 kg/m(2). A question arises regarding the metabolic benefits of bariatric surgery in metabolically healthy but morbidly obese (MHMO) patients, characterized by a low cardiometabolic risk. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of bariatric surgery on cardiometabolic risk factors among MHMO and metabolically unhealthy morbidly obese (MUMO) adults. METHODS: A nonrandomized, prospective cohort study was conducted on 222 severely obese patients (BMI>40 kg/m(2)) undergoing either laparoscopic roux-en-Y gastric bypass or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Patients were classified as MHMO if only 1 or no cardiometabolic factors were present: high blood pressure, triglycerides, blood glucose (or use of medication for any of these conditions), decreased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, and insulin resistance defined as homeostasis model assessment for insulin-resistance (HOMA-IR)>3.29. RESULTS: Forty-two (18.9%) patients fulfilled the criteria for MHMO. They were younger and more frequently female than MUMO patients. No differences between groups were observed for weight, BMI, waist and hip circumference, total and LDL-C. MHMO patients showed a significant decrease in blood pressure, plasma glucose, HOMA-IR, total cholesterol, LDL-C and triglycerides and an increase in HDL-C 1 year after bariatric surgery.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of cervical spine radiographs of 234 pediatric patients (age range, 3 months-17 years 11 months) who had been seen in our pediatric emergency department during the period of 2000-2005 for evaluation after acute trauma was performed. All patients underwent cervical spine MDCT examination at the same presentation. Radiographs were evaluated for the presence of fractures, subluxations, and dislocations. Radiographic abnormalities were correlated to findings on MDCT, which was used as the reference standard. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients had positive findings on CT: Atlantooccipital subluxation/dislocation was seen in one patient; C1 ring fracture, in three patients; C1-C2 rotatory subluxation, in one; C1-C2 subluxation/dislocation, in one; odontoid fracture, in two; vertebral body wedge fracture, in six; posterior arch fracture dislocation, in 10; and spinous process fracture, in none. The lateral view radiograph alone had 73% sensitivity (95% CI, 50-89%) and 92% specificity (95% CI, 87-95%) for cervical spine abnormalities compared with MDCT. The addition of other views did not change the sensitivity of radiography but rather marginally decreased its specificity to 91% (95% CI, 86-95%).",

        "input": "PURPOSE: A prospective, single institution study was conducted to evaluate the role of positron emission tomography with fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) before and after definitive radiation therapy for patients with head-and-neck cancer. Correlation with CT or MRI imaging and pathologic findings at the time of planned neck dissection was made. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twelve patients with AJCC Stages III-IV cancer of the head and neck received CT or MRI and PET imaging before treatment with definitive radiation therapy. One month after completion of treatment, repeat CT or MRI and PET imaging was obtained. All images were reviewed independently by radiologists who were blind to the results of the other modality. Patients then underwent planned neck dissection. Pathologic correlation with posttreatment scans allowed calculation of the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and the positive predictive value for both CT/MRI and PET. RESULTS: Comparison of CT/MRI to PET obtained before definitive RT revealed both primary tumor and nodal disease were detected by both modalities in all cases where primary tumor was known. After RT, comparison of CT/MRI imaging to findings of neck dissection revealed a sensitivity of 90%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100%, and negative predictive value of 50%. Comparison of PET imaging with pathologic findings demonstrated sensitivity of 45%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100%, and a negative predictive value of 14%.",

This cohort study aims to determine if preoperative stenting adversely affects long-term survival by comparing a group of patients having preoperative stenting (group A) with a group of patients having elective surgery (group B) in a single centre. METHODS: The study is retrospective. Survival was calculated with Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared using the log-rank test. Other group characteristics were compared with Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: From November 1998 to November 2008, 15 patients had preoperative SEMS and were entered in group A. This represented 11.5 % of a total of 130 patients undergoing SEMS insertion in the same period. Group B included 88 consecutive patients undergoing elective left-sided colonic resection for Dukes' B and C cancer excluding mid and low rectal tumours between January 2003 and December 2007. The 30-day mortality rate for groups A and B was 6.7 % (one patient) and 5.7 % (five patients), respectively. The 5-year survival rate was 60 % and 58 %, respectively, with a p value of 0.96.",

This study reports a single center experience utilizing an intensive transcatheter approach to promote pulmonary vascular growth. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 20 patients undergoing surgical and transcatheter treatment for pulmonary atresia with VSD between 2002 and 2010. RESULTS: The median age at initial surgical palliation was 6.3 months (8 days to 2.5 years). Eleven patients (group 1) underwent initial surgical palliation without VSD closure and nine patients (group 2) underwent an initial complete repair with fenestrated or complete VSD closure. Group 1 had a smaller Nakata index (54 mm2/m2 vs. 134 mm2/m2 , P = .04) and a smaller absolute native pulmonary artery diameter (2.7 mm vs. 4.5 mm, P = .01) than group 2. Intraoperative angiography was performed in 10 cases to evaluate if early transcatheter intervention was warranted. The median follow-up during the study period was 2.3 years (1.6 months to 8.3 years). Of the 16 patients who survived the initial early postoperative period, 15 patients (94%) went on to receive surgical (n = 11) and/or interventional (n = 25) catheterization procedures. There was improvement in the mean Nakata index from the initial presurgical evaluation to the most recent catheterization data (38.4 mm2/m2 vs. 169.7 mm2/m2 , P = .001). There was also a significant improvement in the mean native pulmonary artery diameter (2.7 mm vs. 4.5 mm, P = .001). There were no significant differences in the number of patients who underwent surgical or interventional catheterization procedures, the number of patients who underwent multiple catheterization procedures, or the number of patients who died.",

METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of 7631 adolescents from 231 Australian schools. Measures included pubertal status, recent (30day) alcohol use, parent-adolescent emotional closeness, family conflict, parental permissiveness of alcohol use and peer alcohol use. The analysis was based on a two-level (individuals nested within schools) logistic regression model, with main effects entered first, and interaction terms added second. RESULTS: The interaction of family factors and pubertal stage did not improve the fit of the model, so a main effect model of family factors and pubertal stage was adopted. There were significant main effects for pubertal stage with boys in middle puberty at increased odds of alcohol use, and girls in advanced puberty at increased odds of alcohol use.",

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: In a non-randomized, uncontrolled pilot study, the authors investigated whether depressed patients were more likely to perceive the lighting in their environment as being dimmer than usual. METHOD: 120 patients (46 males, 74 females) who presented for possible admission for depression at a psychiatric facility were administered a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of disorders (DSM-IV) based questionnaire and underwent psychiatric evaluation. A question asking whether 'the lights in my surroundings seem dimmer than usual' was included in the 15-point question survey. Statistical analyses were performed to determine whether an affirmative response to this dimness question was correlated with the depth of depression (mild, moderate, severe) and also whether significant correlation was present between the percentage of patients answering yes to the dimness question versus the number of yes responses to the core symptoms of depression. RESULTS: Two thirds of the patients categorized as severely depressed responded that their ambient environment appeared dimmer than usual compared to 21% of moderately and 14% of mildly depressed patients. This difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). The degree of depression as determined by the number of core questions answered affirmatively and the presence of this 'dimness' symptom were highly correlated (P=0.002, R=0.87). LIMITATIONS: The specificity of the finding has not been tested in reference to non-affective psychiatric patient groups.",

The hypothesis that the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of different patients undergoing polysomnography may be seasonally affected was tested. METHODS: The retrospectively analyzed database included 7,523 patients of both sexes who underwent in-laboratory baseline polysomnography to investigate any complaint of disordered sleep, during 1 decade, between January 2000 and December 2009. Data on climate and air pollution were obtained from official organizations. AHI was the main outcome variable. Cosinor analysis, a statistical method for the investigation of time series, was used to detect seasonality. RESULTS: The cosinor analysis confirmed the existence of a circannual pattern of AHI, with acrophase in winter and nadir during the summer. The seasonality is significant even after adjusting for sex, age, BMI, neck circumference, and relative air humidity. Median (25-75 interquartile range) AHI in the 6 months with colder weather was 17.8 (6.5-40.6/h), and in the warmer weather was 15.0 (5.7-33.2/h).

Moreover, YB-1 plays a key role in P-glycoprotein expression. Because ovarian carcinoma traditionally has been treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy, the sensitivity of the tumors to chemotherapy could reflect a particular prognosis in patients with ovarian carcinoma. The aim of the current study was to determine whether YB-1 expression correlated with prognosis in ovarian serous adenocarcinoma patients. METHODS: The expression of YB-1 in the nucleus was examined immunohistochemically in 42 paraffin embedded primary Stage III (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) serous ovarian carcinoma tumors extirpated by primary surgery at Kyushu University Hospital between 1985-1995. RESULTS: Of the 40 primary ovarian tumors examined, 12 (30%) were positive for YB-1 expression in the nucleus. There was no significant difference in intraperitoneal stage, histologic grade, or residual tumor size after primary surgery between patients with tumors with positive and those with negative nuclear expression of YB-1 protein. The disease free survival curve for patients whose tumors were positive for nuclear expression of YB-1 protein was significantly worse than that for patients whose tumors were negative (P = 0.0025).

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Gait and cognitive disturbances are common in Parkinson's disease (PD). These deficits exacerbate fall risk and difficulties with mobility, especially during complex or dual-task walking. Traditional gait training generally fails to fully address these complex gait activities. Virtual reality (VR) incorporates principles of motor learning while delivering engaging and challenging training in complex environments. We hypothesized that VR may be applied to address the multifaceted deficits associated with fall risk in PD. METHODS: Twenty patients received 18 sessions (3 per week) of progressive intensive treadmill training with virtual obstacles (TT + VR). Outcome measures included gait under usual-walking and dual-task conditions and while negotiating physical obstacles. Cognitive function and functional performance were also assessed. RESULTS: Patients were 67.1 \u00b1 6.5 years and had a mean disease duration of 9.8 \u00b1 5.6 years. Posttraining, gait speed significantly improved during usual walking, during dual task, and while negotiating overground obstacles.

Mortality was defined as the sum of deaths coded to CHD and deaths coded to related causes but with prior hospitalisation for CHD (in the preceding five years). Data were sourced from the New Zealand Health Information Service and record linkage was carried out using a unique national identifier, the National Health Index (NHI). Given estimates for incidence and mortality, multi-state lifetables were built and estimates for prevalence, survival, lifetable risk, and median age at onset extracted. RESULTS: Estimated prevalence of CHD increased exponentially from around 2% for males and 0.5% for females at age 40-44 to peak at around 18% and 12% respectively at age 85-89. Median age at onset of CHD was 67.5 years for males and 77.5 years for females. Median survival duration was 9.5 years for males and 6.2 years for females. The lifetable risk of CHD was estimated at 35% for males and 28% for females.",

METHODS: From 1996 to 2003, 102 transthoracic en-bloc esophagectomy were performed for adenocarcinoma. Based on the 1994 consensus conference of the International Society of Disease of Esophagus, 35 patients underwent standard lymphadenectomy whereas 67 underwent extended lymphadenectomy. Mortality, morbidity and long-term survival were reviewed in each group. RESULTS: Extended lymphadenectomy increased the number of resected lymph nodes and improved the healthy/invaded lymph node ratio. It allowed to detect skip nodal metastasis in 36.4% of the N+ patients. Morbidity was higher following extended lymphadenectomy, with respect to pulmonary complications, and blood transfusions requirement (P=0.04). However, operative mortality was similar in both groups (9 vs. 11%). Overall disease-free survival was 28% at 5 years. Median of survival was higher in N0 than in N+ patients (55 months vs. 20 months; P=0.02). Extended lymphadenectomy was associated with an improving of disease-free survival when compared to standard lymphadenectomy (41 vs. 10% at 5 years; P<0.05), especially in the subgroup of patients with a N0 disease (median of survival 44 months vs. 17 months; P=0.001).

We examined whether operator experience is associated with 30-day risk of stroke or death in the Carotid Stenting Trialists' Collaboration database. METHODS: The Carotid Stenting Trialists' Collaboration is a pooled individual patient database including all patients recruited in 3 randomized trials of stenting versus endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis (Endarterectomy Versus Angioplasty in patients with Symptomatic Severe Carotid Stenosis trial, Stent-Protected Angioplasty versus Carotid Endarterectomy trial, and International Carotid Stenting Study). Lifetime carotid artery stenting experience, lifetime experience in stenting procedures excluding the carotid, and annual number of procedures performed within the trial (in-trial volume), divided into tertiles, were used to measure operator experience. The outcome event was the occurrence of any stroke or death within 30 days of the procedure. The analysis was done per protocol. RESULTS: Among 1546 patients who underwent carotid artery stenting, 120 (7.8%) had a stroke or death within 30 days of the procedure. The 30-day risk of stroke or death did not differ according to operator lifetime carotid artery stenting experience (P=0.8) or operator lifetime stenting experience excluding the carotid (P=0.7).

        "input": "BACKGROUND: During mechanical ventilation of infants and neonates, small changes in tidal volume may lead to hypo- or hyperventilation, barotrauma, or volutrauma. Partly because breathing circuit compliance and fresh gas flow affect tidal volume delivery by traditional anesthesia ventilators in volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) mode, pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) using a circle breathing system has become a common approach to minimizing the risk of mechanical ventilation for small patients, although delivered tidal volume is not assured during PCV. A new generation of anesthesia machine ventilators addresses the problems of VCV by adjusting for fresh gas flow and for the compliance of the breathing circuit. In this study, we evaluated the accuracy of new anesthesia ventilators to deliver small tidal volumes. METHODS: Four anesthesia ventilator systems were evaluated to determine the accuracy of volume delivery to the airway during VCV at tidal volume settings of 100, 200, and 500 mL under different conditions of breathing circuit compliance (fully extended and fully contracted circuits) and lung compliance. A mechanical test lung (adult and infant) was used to simulate lung compliances ranging from 0.0025 to 0.03 L/cm H(2)O. Volumes and pressures were measured using a calibrated screen pneumotachograph and custom software. We tested the Smartvent 7900, Avance, and Aisys anesthesia ventilator systems (GE Healthcare, Madison, WI) and the Apollo anesthesia ventilator (Draeger Medical, Telford, PA). The Smartvent 7900 and Avance ventilators use inspiratory flow sensors to control the volume delivered, whereas the Aisys and Apollo ventilators compensate for the compliance of the circuit. RESULTS: The Smartvent 7900 and Avance ventilators delivered the smallest tidal volumes at all lung compliances, with differences of < or = 10 mL between the smallest and largest tidal volumes. The Aisys and Apollo ventilators delivered the largest tidal volumes at all lung compliances, with differences of > 100 mL between the smallest and largest tidal volumes.",

DESIGN: An exploratory, social constructionist grounded theory methodology was adopted. METHODS: Eleven clinical psychologists working in adult mental health services each participated in one individual semistructured interview. RESULTS: The clinical psychologists studied were aware of the emergence of recovery-oriented approaches, but felt unable to incorporate them in practice because of perceptions of being bound by both their own limitations and those of their circumstances, including issues of risk, thus giving rise to dilemmas in professional practice. Narrow definitions of risk as equated to danger dominated over broader conceptualizations of risk with positive consequences. The existing culture of mental health services was seen as emphasizing the need to avoid harmful consequences of taking risks, which in turn was seen to limit innovations in implementing recovery-oriented approaches.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Materials for analysis were physiological and pathological tissues of breast, ovary and uterus. The carotenoid pigments were isolated using column chromatography (CC), thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: Sixteen carotenoids were identified in the study material, including those belonging to the provitamin A group. The most common were: beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lutein, mutatoxanthin, violaxanthin, lutein epoxide and zeaxanthin. All the tissues subjected to analysis contained beta-carotene, 98% of the tissues had beta-cryptoxanthin, whereas alpha-carotene was detected in about 50% of breast tissue. No differences in carotenoid concentration were found between benign and malignant lesions in the examined tissues, apart from hydroxyechinenone, canthaxanthin, astaxanthin, lutein epoxide, antheraxanthin and neoxanthin.

This article examines how coverage gaps of different lengths affect access to health care among low-income children. METHODS: We conducted a multivariable, cross-sectional analysis of statewide primary data from families in Oregon's food stamp population with children presumed eligible for publicly funded health insurance. The key independent variable was length of a child's insurance coverage gap; outcome variables were 6 measures of health care access. RESULTS: More than 25% of children reported a coverage gap during the 12-month study period. Children most likely to have a gap were older, Hispanic, lived in households earning between 133% and 185% of the federal poverty level, and/or had an employed parent. After adjusting for these characteristics, in comparison with continuously insured children, a child with a gap of any length had a higher likelihood of unmet medical, prescription, and dental needs; no usual source of care; no doctor visits in the past year; and delayed urgent care. When comparing coverage gaps, children without coverage for longer than 6 months had a higher likelihood of unmet needs compared with children with a gap shorter than 6 months. In some cases, children with gaps longer than 6 months were similar to, or worse off than, children who had never been insured.",

The human HINT1 gene is located on chromosome 5q31.2, a region implicated in linkage studies of schizophrenia. HINT1 had been shown to have different expression in postmortem brains between schizophrenia patients and unaffected controls. It was also found to be associated with the dysregulation of postsynaptic dopamine transmission, thus suggesting a potential role in several neuropsychiatric diseases. METHODS: : In this work, we studied 8 SNPs around the HINT1 gene region using the Irish study of high density schizophrenia families (ISHDSF, 1350 subjects and 273 pedigrees) and the Irish case control study of schizophrenia (ICCSS, 655 affected subjects and 626 controls).

METHODS: Both pediatric and adult patients were studied in two groups: those with a straight or nearly straight septum (n = 25 and 124, respectively) and those with deviation (n = 64 and 129, respectively). The cross-sectional area (CSA) of the IT bone and soft tissue were measured at anterior, middle, and posterior thirds of the IT in coronal CT sections. The ratio of CSA of the IT bone and soft tissue on two sides of the septum (interturbinate ratio [IR]) were calculated. IRs were then compared among straight septum and deviation groups for both the pediatric and the adult groups. RESULTS: IR of the bony concha CSA for the deviation group was significantly higher compared with the straight septum group in anterior, middle, and posterior segments in adults (p = 0.028, 0.018, and<0.001, respectively; independent samples t-test). The soft tissue component hypertrophy was prominent only in the middle segment (p = 0.15); however, there was no significant difference for pediatric patients. Also, there was a statistically significant difference between the adult group with septum deviation and the pediatric group with septum deviation for both soft tissue and bone components (p<0.001 for all segments; independent samples t-test).",

In a previous study, we reported that depression is also associated with low plasma Abeta(42) levels in the elderly population. OBJECTIVE: To characterize plasma Abeta(40):Abeta(42) ratio and cognitive function in elderly individuals with and without depression. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Homecare agencies. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 995 homebound elderly individuals of whom 348 were defined as depressed by a Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression score of 16 or greater. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cognitive domains of memory, language, executive, and visuospatial functions according to levels of plasma Abeta(40) and Abeta(42) peptides. RESULTS: Subjects with depression had lower plasma Abeta(42) levels (median, 14.1 vs 19.2 pg/mL; P = .006) and a higher plasma Abeta(40):Abeta(42) ratio (median, 8.9 vs 6.4; P<.001) than did those without depression in the absence of cardiovascular disease and antidepressant use. The interaction between depression and plasma Abeta(40):Abeta(42) ratio was associated with lower memory score (beta = -1.9, SE = 0.7, P = .006) after adjusting for potentially confounders. Relative to those without depression, \"amyloid-associated depression,\" defined by presence of depression and a high plasma Abeta(40):Abeta(42) ratio, was associated with lower memory scores (beta = -2.2, SE = 0.7, P = .006).",

However, little is known about how nutrition labels are used by consumers and what effect reading labels has on dietary behaviors. METHODS: This article identifies behavioral and health status correlates of nutrition label reading and describes patterns of label use among 885 adult patients from four family medicine clinics in southeastern Missouri. To participate, patients completed a self-administered survey while waiting to see their physicians. RESULTS: Analyses revealed patients eating diets lower in fat were much more likely (51% versus 26%) than patients whose diets were higher in fat to report labels influencing their food purchase decisions, as were patients eating diets higher in fruits, vegetables, and fiber. Patients with high blood pressure were 63% more likely than those with normal or low blood pressure to look for sodium on the nutrition label (odds ratio [OR] = 1.63, 95% confidence interval [CI]= 1.35, 1.97), but no more likely to look for other nutrition label information. Similarly, patients with high cholesterol were more likely than those with normal or low cholesterol to look for saturated fat (OR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.13, 1.72) and cholesterol (OR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.29, 1.98) on the label, but no more likely to look for other nutrition label information.",

However, cervical lengths have not been formally compared between women with prolapse and those with normal support. METHODS: Cervix and uterine corpus lengths were measured on magnetic resonance images in a case-control study of 51 women with prolapse and 46 women with normal support determined by the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) examination. Group matching ensured similar demographics in both groups. Ranges for normal cervical lengths were determined from the values in the control group in order to evaluate for cervical elongation amongst women with prolapse. RESULTS: The cervix is 36.4 % (8.6 mm) longer in women with prolapse than in women with normal pelvic support (p<0.001). Linear regression modeling suggests the feature most highly associated with cervical length is the degree of uterine descent (POP-Q point C). Approximately 40 % of women with prolapse have cervical elongation; 57 % of cervical elongation in prolapse can be explained by a logistic regression-based model including POP-Q point C, body mass index, and menopausal status.",

The purpose of this study is to evaluate histopathological patterns of colorectal endometriosis and investigate potential relationships between histological findings and clinical data. METHODS: We consecutively included 47 patients treated with laparoscopic segmental resection because of symptomatic colorectal endometriosis. All patients underwent follow-up for a median of 18 months (range: 6-35). We examined the histological patterns of colorectal endometriosis and evaluated the relationships between histological findings (satellite lesions, positive margins and vertical infiltration) and clinical outcomes (incidence of recurrence, quality of life and symptom improvement). Moreover, we observed if satellite lesions could influence preoperative scores of the short form-36 health survey (SF-36) questionnaire and visual analogue score (VAS) for pain symptoms. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in terms of anatomical and pain recurrences, pain symptoms and quality of life improvement among patients with or without positive margins, satellite lesions and different degrees of vertical infiltration (P>0.05).

METHOD: In one volunteer, the osteomeatal complex and sphenoethmoidal recess were occluded to isolate the nose from the sinuses. The antrum and frontal sinus were each punctured by two catheters and irrigated with air at constant flow. Nitric oxide output and its rate of accumulation in the absence of air flow were measured in each sinus and in the adjacent nasal cavity. RESULTS: Prior to ostial occlusion, NO output in the nose was 96 nL/min. It decreased by 12% after blockage of all of the ostia. In the isolated sinuses, it was 190 nL/min (antrum) and 68 nL/min (frontal). After 5 minutes stagnation; NO concentration [NO] rose in the occluded sinuses to 24,700 nL/L in the antrum and 22,300 nL/L in the frontal sinus. In the nose, it increased to 29,000 nL/L. When the period of stagnation was prolonged in the frontal sinus, the [NO]reached a plateau. NO output and accumulation were not altered in the nose or either sinus by opening their ostia. In the antrum and frontal sinus, lidocaine reduced NO output and the rate of NO accumulation, but not in the nose.",

METHODS: Consecutive patients referred for colonoscopy for a positive fecal occult blood test result at a Veterans Affairs hospital were eligible. Patients with hematochezia, peptic ulcer disease, or unevaluated dyspepsia requiring antacids, or who used warfarin, were excluded. Regular aspirin and NSAID use was defined as at least one daily dose for at least 3 days per week. Colonoscopic findings unlikely to explain a positive test result alone were defined a priori as diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, or polyps<1.0 cm with no villous histology. Findings likely to explain a positive test result included cancer and advanced polyps. RESULTS: The sample comprised 193 veterans with a mean (+/- SD) age of 66 +/- 10 years; 98% were male and 86% were white.

The overlap of these symptoms often results in physicians ordering unnecessary LE Doppler ultrasounds in patients with LE cellulitis. This practice leads to subjecting patients to unwarranted procedures and results in increased healthcare costs. We aimed to determine the percentage of Doppler ultrasounds performed in patients admitted with LE cellulitis and the prevalence of DVT in that population. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of the patients admitted January 1, 2009 to June 30, 2013 who had a diagnosis of LE cellulitis. The number of Doppler ultrasounds performed and the presence of DVT was recorded. Patients were divided into groups of Doppler ultrasounds with no DVT and Doppler ultrasounds that were positive for DVT to compare the risk factors. RESULTS: There were 624 patients identified using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision code for LE cellulitis at the time of admission. Slightly more than half of the subjects were men (315/624) and the average age was 61.4 \u00b1 18.8 years (mean \u00b1 standard deviation). There were 417 (66.8%) patients who underwent Doppler ultrasound. Only 25 (5.9%) patients had DVT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a C-arm 0.2 T system, four interventional MR sequences were applied in 23 liver cases and during MR-guided neck interventions in 13 patients. The imaging protocol consisted of: multislice turbo spin echo (TSE) T2w, sequential-slice fast imaging with steady precession (FISP), a time-reversed version of FISP (PSIF), and FISP with balanced gradients in all spatial directions (True-FISP) sequences. Vessel conspicuity was rated and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was calculated for each sequence and a differential receiver operating characteristic was performed. RESULTS: Liver findings were detected in 96% using the TSE sequence. PSIF, FISP, and True-FISP imaging showed lesions in 91%, 61%, and 65%, respectively. The TSE sequence offered the best CNR, followed by PSIF imaging. Differential receiver operating characteristic analysis also rated TSE and PSIF to be the superior sequences. Lesions in the head and neck were detected in all cases by TSE and FISP, in 92% using True-FISP, and in 84% using PSIF. True-FISP offered the best CNR, followed by TSE imaging. Vessels appeared bright on FISP and True-FISP imaging and dark on the other sequences.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) have been used to assess the clinical competence and interpersonal skills of healthcare professional students for decades. However, the relationship between preclinical (second year or M2) OSCE grades and clerkship performance had never been evaluated, until it was explored to provide information to educators at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC). In addition, the relationship between M2 OSCE communication scores (which is a portion of the total score) and third-year (M3) Internal Medicine (IM) clerkship OSCE scores was also explored. Lastly, conflicting evidence exists about the relationship between the amount of previous clinical experience and OSCE performance. Therefore, the relationship between M3 IM clerkship OSCE scores and the timing of the clerkship in the academic year was explored. METHODS: Data from UNMC M2 OSCEs and M3 IM clerkship OSCEs were obtained for graduates of the 2013 and 2014 classes. Specifically, the following data points were collected: M2 fall OSCE total, M2 fall OSCE communication; M2 spring OSCE total, M2 spring OSCE communication; and M3 IM clerkship OSCE total percentages. Data were organized by class, M3 IM clerkship OSCE performance, and timing of the clerkship. Microsoft Excel and SPSS were used for data organization and analysis. RESULTS: Of the 245 records, 229 (93.5%) had data points for all metrics of interest. Significant differences between the classes of 2013 and 2014 existed for average M2 spring total, M2 spring communication, and M3 IM clerkship OSCEs. Retrospectively, there were no differences in M2 OSCE performances based on how students scored on the M3 IM clerkship OSCE. M3 IM clerkship OSCE performance improved for those students who had more clinical experience prior to the clerkship.",

The aim of this study was the correlation of perioperative ischemic complications and vascular calcifications of patients undergoing TKA. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, all 825 patients who had undergone primary TKA in the period 2009-2011 with intraoperative use of a tourniquet were included. Patients with pathologic pulse status and history of vascular intervention were excluded. Vascular calcifications seen on the preoperative radiograph were classified as intimal-type and medial-type calcifications and were correlated to perioperative ischemic complications. RESULTS: Vascular calcifications were seen in 268 patients (medial type: n\u00a0= 54, intimal type: n\u00a0= 214). Major ischemic complications such as arterial thrombosis were seen in 2 patients, one of them with intimal-type calcifications and one without (complication rate 0.5% vs 0.2%, P\u00a0= .715). The rate of minor ischemic complications such as protracted wound healing was significantly elevated in patients with intimal-type calcifications (6.1%) when compared to patients with medial-type calcifications (1.9%) and those without (1.6%, P\u00a0= .003) even when multiple regression analysis was performed taking into account 2 potential influencing factors \"age\" and \"diabetes mellitus\" (P\u00a0= .008).",

Their demographics, white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, body temperature, computed tomography scan usage, operation method, pathology report, postoperative complication, length of hospital stay, and ETA were abstracted. Multivariate analysis was performed to search the predictors, including ETA, of outcomes for the perforation and postoperative complication rates. RESULTS: A total of 236 patients were included in the study. Perforation occurred in 12.7% (30/236) and postoperative complications developed in 24.1% (57/236) of these patients. There were 121 patients with ETA<8 hours, 88 patients with ETA of 8-24 hours, and 27 patients with ETA>24 hours; patients with ETA>24 hours had significantly longer hospital stay.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to survey patients who were prescribed home phototherapy to determine the viability of narrow-band ultraviolet B home units in the continuous or maintenance treatment of photoresponsive diseases. METHODS: A patient questionnaire was prepared focusing on different areas of interest: the reason for choosing home therapy, appropriate teaching, previous medical treatment, present exposure therapy, improvement of the condition, side effects, regular dermatologic follow-ups, and the effectiveness of this approach. Twenty-seven patients who attended the photodermatology clinics at the Sisters of Charity of Ottawa Health Service at the Elisabeth Bruy\u00e8re Health Centre in Ottawa and the Ottawa Hospital Civic Campus were contacted, and they completed a questionnaire by telephone or electronic mail. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients completed the questionnaire. One refused to participate, and one was out of the country.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients who were undergoing ERCP were randomized to start the procedure in either the prone position or the supine position. Patients under the age of 18 years, intubated patients, and those who had already undergone endoscopic sphincterotomy were excluded. The difficulty of cannulation was assessed using the Freeman score (1=one to five attempts; 2=six to 15 attempts; 3=more than 15 attempts; 4=failure of cannulation). Total procedure time, patient tolerance, willingness to undergo ERCP in the future, and procedure-related adverse cardiorespiratory events (oxygen desaturation, tachycardia, bradycardia) were also recorded. RESULTS: A total of 34 patients were evaluated (21 men, 13 women; mean age 68, range 20-96), 17 patients in each group. Demographic and clinical features, and the indications for the procedure were similar for the two patient groups.

DESIGN: Data were collected through a mailed questionnaire. SUBJECTS: A random sample of 500 hospital foodservice directors and 500 hospital executives to whom the directors report. ANALYSIS: Chi2, Mann-Whitney, and Kruskall-Wallis tests were used to examine differences among ratings by and demographic characteristics of foodservice directors and the executives with whom they work. RESULTS: All competencies were perceived to be important for someone in the role of hospital foodservice director. RDs were perceived to be somewhat competent in all areas studied but were only perceived to be competent to expert in a few of the areas. Directors who were RDs and hospital executives who had worked with RDs rated the competence level of RDs higher than did non-RD directors and hospital executives who had not worked with RDs.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) may be at risk for metabolic bone disease (MBD) because of biochemical derangements caused by the renal disease, as well as steroid therapy. No large study to date has shown conclusively that these children are prone to MBD. METHODS: We prospectively studied 100 consecutive children with INS for clinical, biochemical, and radiological evidence of MBD. These children were treated with prednisone as follows: initial episode, prednisone, 60 mg/m2/d for 6 weeks, followed by 40 mg/m2 on alternate days for 6 weeks. Relapses were treated with 60 mg/m2/d until remission for 3 days, followed by 40 mg on alternate days for 4 weeks and tapered by 10 mg/m2/wk. Osteoporosis is defined as a bone mineral density (BMD) value evaluated by dual-energy X-linked absorptiometry of the lumbar spine of a z score of 2.5 SDs less than the mean. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to analyze for factors predictive of low BMD z score. Children were divided into two groups: those who had received repeated courses of steroid therapy (group II: frequent relapsers (FRs), steroid dependent (SD), or steroid nonresponders (SNRs) versus those who had received infrequent courses (group I: infrequent relapsers). RESULTS: Twenty-two of 100 children (22%) had osteoporosis. Comparing clinical features, we observed that 6 of 70 children in group II were symptomatic (hypocalcemic signs) compared with none of 30 children in group I (P = 0.10). However, the mean BMD z score was significantly lower in group II (1.25 SDs) than in group I (0.75 SDs) (P = 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that the only significant predictor of osteoporosis was the number of courses of steroid therapy (P = 0.001).",

Recent studies have shown that postoperative epidural infusion of bupivacaine decreases time to return of bowel function compared with intravenous and epidural morphine in patients after abdominal surgery. This study focuses on the role of the intraoperative anesthetic technique on recovery of bowel function, intraoperative blood loss, and the incidence of postoperative deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy. METHODS: Forty patients undergoing prostatectomy were randomized to either group A (general endotracheal anesthesia, including muscle relaxation and mechanical ventilation, followed by postoperative intravenous morphine patient-controlled analgesia) or group B (thoracic epidural anesthesia using bupivacaine, combined with \"light\" general anesthesia using a laryngeal mask airway and spontaneous ventilation, followed by epidural morphine analgesia). Intra- and postoperative data were collected on blood loss, volumes of crystalloid and colloid infused, blood transfused, duration of anesthesia and surgery, anesthetic and surgical complications, time to recovery of bowel function, quality of postoperative pain control, and time to discharge from hospital. Each patient underwent lower extremity venous ultrasonography to detect DVT. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients received general anesthesia and 19 received combined epidural and general anesthesia. Intraoperative blood loss was significantly lower in the epidural group, and times to first flatus and first bowel movement were also shorter in this group.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Postoperative pain is a concern for patients seeking hemorrhoid surgery. Stapled hemorrhoidopexy is popular due to better patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Pain is the index of PROs. Posthemorrhoidectomy patients usually opt for a spice-free diet due to fear of pain or anal pruritus induced by spices. Curcumin and peprin (spice constituents) have powerful antiinflammatory and antioxidant properties. Ability to resume a normal taste-habituated meal may improve PRO quality of life. Thus, spice-related paradoxic conservatism in stapled hemorrhoidopexy, which involves no open wound, needed to be studied. METHODS: A prospective open-ended study (July 2008 to August 2009) investigated consecutive candidates for day-care stapled hemorrhoidopexy randomized by the date of birth method into a controlled group (receiving a spices-free diet) and a study group (receiving a spicy diet) after an ethics and informed consent protocol. A standard perioperative protocol was followed. At discharge, the patients were advised to resume a normal diet (spicy or bland) and instructed to maintain a pain diary (100-point visual analog scale [VAS]) and an analgesic diary. Paracetamol 650 mg was used for pain exceeding a VAS score of 25. Patients were followed on day 3 and weeks 1 and 3. Failure to be discharged from day care, failure to maintain patient diary, and squamous epithelium in the rectal donut were the withdrawal criteria. RESULTS: A total of 67 patients were randomized. The groups were well matched for demographics, comorbidities, types of anesthesia, and operative time. The study group had a significantly higher VAS score at discharge (P = .001) and at week 1 (P = .001).

In 2015, a new law project was thus presented in which the French National Authority for Health recommended that doctors, including all specialists, bring up the subject, especially during consultation. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the vascular specialist's possibility to mention the topic of advanced directives during consultations. METHOD: A single and non-interventional prospective study conducted with the help of patients who consulted a private practitioner vascular specialist: recurrent patients regularly consulting a private practitioner vascular specialist were included. First-time consultants, minors and patients to whom it was not adapted to speak about the subject were not included. RESULTS: Between July 27\u00a0and September 23, 2015, 159\u00a0consecutive patients were examined. Fifty-five first-time consultants and four patients for whom the interview was unsuitable were excluded. In all, 100\u00a0patients were questioned. None of them refused to talk about the subject. Women made up a majority of the population (63\u00a0%) with an average age of 67\u00a0years (23-97).

This study aims to identify patient factors that may help in patient selection for PEG. METHODS: Patients who underwent PEG at the Gastroenterology Unit of Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore, from January 1998 to December 1999, were identified. Multiple logistic regression was used to predict patient's outcomes. RESULTS: There were 106 (61 male) patients with a mean follow-up period of 465 days (range 3-1,410 days). The mean patient age was 64.5 years (range 17-94 years). The 30-day, six-month, one-year and two-year mortality rates were 7.5 percent, 26.4 percent, 35.8 percent and 46.2 percent, respectively. Older age (p-value is 0.023), presence of bedsores (p-value is 0.042) and abnormal nutritional status based on body mass index less than 20 kg/square metres (p-value is 0.001) were predictive of mortality. 26 percent of patients were able to wean off PEG in an average period of 185 days (range 3-870 days).

METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was used to identify all patients between 1988 and 2010 with DA. Patients were divided into two groups based on the type of surgery received: simple resection (SR), defined as a simple removal of the primary site, and radical resection (RR), defined as removal of the primary site with a resection in continuity with other organs. Differences in disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) were compared. RESULTS: Of the 1,611 patients included, 746 (46.3\u00a0%) underwent SR and 865 (53.7\u00a0%) underwent RR. As expected, patients undergoing RR were more likely to present with poorly differentiated and large tumors, as well as advanced stage disease. Despite greater lymph node (LN) retrieval (11.0 vs. 6.8; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), RR was not associated with improved survival (5-year DSS and OS rates of 52.8 and 41.3\u00a0% for SR vs. 48.8 and 37.6\u00a0% for RR; p\u00a0>\u00a00.05).

Pregnant patients who had a T&S obtained as part of their ED evaluation were enrolled. Subjects completed a standardized data form that requested demographic information and were asked to select \"no,\" \"maybe,\" or \"yes, definitely\" if they knew their blood type. Standard descriptive statistics with 95% confidence intervals were performed. RESULTS: There were 319 pregnant women enrolled in the study. Among the 106 subjects that reported \"yes, definitely\" they knew their blood type, 103 (97.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 94.0-100%]) identified their correct blood type and 105 (99.1%; 95% CI 97.2-100%) identified their correct Rh status. None of these subjects selected a positive Rh when they were in fact a negative Rh. All 14 (13.2%) subjects with a negative Rh status identified themselves as having a negative Rh.",

        "input": "OBJECTIVES: Alterations in retinal vascular calibre, particularly wider venular calibre, have been independently associated with elevated markers of inflammation and cardiovascular risk in the general population. We hypothesized that retinal vascular calibre would be altered in patients with RA, who are known to have both elevated cardiovascular risk and chronic, systemic inflammation. METHODS: Retinal vascular calibre was measured from digital retinal photographs using computerized methods in 51 RA patients and 51 age- and gender-matched controls. Retinal vascular calibre was compared between RA and control patients with adjustment for relevant variables including cardiovascular risk factors and companion vessel calibre. The relationship between retinal venular calibre and inflammation was assessed by comparing controls and RA patients with high and lower disease activity. RESULTS: Retinal venular calibre [mean (s.d.)] was significantly wider in RA patients than in controls [235.9 (24.6) vs. 211.6 (21.0) \u00b5m, P\u2009<\u20090.001]. After adjustment for all relevant variables, mean venular calibre remained 20.3\u2009\u00b5m (95% CI 10.4, 30.3) wider in RA patients compared with controls. Retinal venular calibre [mean (s.d.)]also increased with increasing levels of systemic inflammation: 211.6 (21.0)\u2009\u00b5m in controls, 232.3 (22.4)\u2009\u00b5m in RA patients with moderate or lower disease activity and 255.5 (28.3)\u2009\u00b5m in RA patients with high disease activity (P for trend<0.0001).",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Overuse injury to the patellar tendon (patellar tendinopathy) is a major reason for interrupted training and competition for elite athletes. In both sexes, the prevalence of unilateral and bilateral tendinopathy has been shown to differ. It has been proposed that bilateral pathology may have a different aetiology from unilateral pathology. Investigation of risk factors that may be unique to unilateral and bilateral patellar tendinopathy in female athletes may reveal insights into the aetiology of this condition. OBJECTIVES: To examine whether anthropometry, body composition, or muscle strength distinguished elite female basketball players with unilateral or bilateral patellar tendinopathy. METHODS: Body composition, anthropometry, and muscle strength were compared in elite female basketball players with unilateral (n = 8), bilateral (n = 7), or no (n = 24) patellar tendinopathy. Body composition was analysed using a dual energy x ray absorptiometer. Anthropometric measures were assessed using standard techniques. Knee extensor strength was measured at 180 degrees /s using an isokinetic dynamometer. z scores were calculated for the unilateral and bilateral groups (using the no tendinopathy group as controls). z scores were tested against zero. RESULTS: The tibia length to stature ratio was approximately 1.3 (1.3) SDs above zero in both the affected and non-affected legs in the unilateral group (p<0.05). The waist to hip ratio was 0.66 (0.78) SD above zero in the unilateral group (p<0.05). In the unilateral group, the knee extensor strength was 1.2 (1.2) SD below the control group (p<0.05).

To test this hypothesis further, we also looked at the risk for CAP in those taking angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), as these drugs have a similar mechanism of action to that of ACE inhibitors but have minimal or no effect on the cough reflex. In addition, the putative protection against pneumonia may instead be related to general inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. DESIGN: Nested case-control study.

METHOD: Forty-eight adolescents (mean age = 15.8 years) participating in the initial phase of the Recognition and Prevention (RAP) program (1998-2005) were included in the current report. Individuals were selected from the overall sample (N = 152) if they had: (1) displayed attenuated positive symptoms, (2) been treated pharmacologically for at least 8 weeks, and (3) been followed up for at least 6 months (mean follow-up = 30.5 months). RESULTS: Two types of medication were naturalistically prescribed: antidepressants (N = 20) or second-generation antipsychotics (N = 28), with polypharmacy common. The 2 treatment groups did not differ in baseline symptom profiles, with the exception of disorganized thinking, which was more severe in second-generation antipsychotic-treated adolescents. Twelve of the 48 adolescents (25%) developed a psychotic disorder, with all converters having been prescribed second-generation antipsychotics. There were no conversions among antidepressant-treated adolescents (log-rank chi(2) = 7.36, df = 1, p = .007). Treatment outcome, however, was confounded, since 11 of the 12 converters were nonadherent.

METHODS: During a tailored multidisciplinary treatment for fibromyalgia, validated self-report questionnaires were assessed at baseline and posttreatment on the outcome measures of pain, functional disability, fatigue, anxiety, and negative mood. In addition, the participants were asked to fill in a questionnaire at the end of the treatment assessing the patient's perception of improvement on core outcomes, as well as satisfaction and usefulness of the treatment. RESULTS: Moderate to relatively high correlations were found between the patient's perception of improvement and pre-post changes on the physical outcomes, in contrast to small or nonsignificant correlations for psychological outcomes. In addition, satisfaction and usefulness were significantly related to pre-post changes on physical outcomes, but no relationship was found with respect to psychological outcomes.",

We investigated the effect of adding N2O to sevoflurane or propofol anesthesia on BIS and SE. METHODS: A total of 28 patients were randomized to receive general anesthesia using either 2% sevoflurane or 120\u2009mcg/kg/min propofol during surgery. After 20 minutes of stable anesthetic and surgical conditions (baseline), 60% N2O was added for 20 minutes. Another 20 minutes was allowed for washout after N2O was discontinued. Sevoflurane concentration was closely monitored using the standard end-tidal gas analysis and vaporizer output was constantly adjusted to offset the second-gas effect caused by the addition and discontinuation of N2O. Mean values for BIS and SE were calculated for the last 5 minutes of the baseline, nitrous oxide, and washout periods. RESULTS: In the propofol group, BIS and SE values in baseline versus N2O periods were 40\u00b110 versus 39\u00b110 and 43\u00b111 versus 43\u00b112, respectively (mean\u00b1SD, P>0.05).

It is generally one the main causes of morbidity and mortality in the world, especially in developed countries. In these countries the frequency with which it appears is linked with the progress reached in the organisation of the public health system and the higher economic and social standards of their populations, which have given rise to prolonged life expectancy and a greater number of elderly people. In poor countries, however, in recent times there has also been an increase in the number of cases of this entity, although there is no correspondence with the arguments mentioned above concerning rich nations. The risk factors (RF) that are invoked when talking about its genesis must always be taken into account when dealing with its prevention. AIMS. To draw attention to the increase in the number of CVD in an under developed country, apparently due to the high frequency of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome suffered by the population.

Given the inconsistency of this result, we tested it using a large population-based cohort data set. METHODS AND RESULTS: Systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BPs) and body mass index were measured in 1 145 758 Swedish men born between 1951 and 1976 who were in young adulthood (median age 18.2 years). During the register-based follow-up, which lasted until the end of 2006, 65 611 new CVD events took place, including 6799 myocardial infarctions and 8827 strokes. Hazard ratios (HRs) per 1-SD increase in systolic and diastolic BP were computed within established body mass index categories (underweight, normal, overweight, or obese) with Cox proportional hazards models. The strongest associations of diastolic BP with CVD (HR 1.18), myocardial infarction (HR 1.22), and stroke (HR 1.13) were observed in the obese category.

        "input": "OBJECTIVES: To provide the first insights into the potential role of urocortin in mammalian spermatogenesis, we studied the expression of urocortin and corticotropin-releasing factor receptors 1 and 2 in the human testis. Urocortin is a bioactive peptide with antiapoptotic and antiproliferative properties. The proper regulation of apoptosis and proliferation is of high physiologic relevance in the control of spermatogenesis in adulthood and of the noncycling stage of gonocytes in fetal life. METHODS: Using polymerase chain reaction analysis and immunohistochemistry, the expression and tissue localization of urocortin on mRNA and at the peptide level was studied in 9 normal adult, 5 fetal, and 5 Sertoli cell-only testicular specimens. Tissue localization of corticotropin-releasing factor receptors in normal adults was considered using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: We found that urocortin mRNA was present in all adult specimens tested and that the urocortin peptide was expressed in elongating spermatids, mature spermatozoa, and peritubular myoid cells, and to a lesser extent in Leydig cells. Corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 was mainly expressed in spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and Leydig cells, and corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 2 was mostly expressed in spermatogonia. The antibodies against urocortin produced a nuclear staining in fetal gonocytes. No significant immunopositivity for urocortin could be observed in the Sertoli cell-only specimens.",

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of patients with concomitant diagnosis of aneurysm and carotid stenosis evaluated in the neurosurgical department at our institution from 1990 to 2013 was carried out. Patients with both revascularized and nonrevascularized carotid stenosis were included. Demographic and angiographic characteristics, medical history, and treatment outcomes were collected. Comparison was made between the following 2 groups: revascularized carotid stenosis with stent or carotid endarterectomy versus nonrevascularized carotid stenosis. RESULTS: The study cohort consisted of 39 patients with 48 stenotic cervical internal carotid arteries and 51 cerebral aneurysms. Twenty patients (51.3%) underwent carotid endarterectomy/stenting, and 19 (48.7%) were managed medically. Patient characteristics were similar across the 2 groups except for increased severity of carotid stenosis (P<0.001) and more posterior circulation aneurysms (P\u00a0= 0.045) in the revascularized group.

Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) of the gastroduodenal artery is an alternative strategy when endoscopic therapy fails. This study is a retrospective analysis comparing these two treatment strategies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients who underwent TAE (n = 24) or open surgery (n = 50) after unsuccessful endoscopic therapy for bleeding duodenal ulcers at two university hospitals between 2000 and 2007 were compared. Mortality, morbidity, length of hospital stay, age, number of endoscopic interventions and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score were evaluated. RESULTS: The groups were comparable concerning gender and length of hospital stay. The mean age (69.6 +/- 16.1 versus 61.9 +/- 14.1 years; P = 0.043), APACHE II score (17.0 +/- 5.1 versus 12.8 +/- 5.7; P = 0.004) and number of gastroscopies (P = 0.009) were significantly higher in the embolization group. Five patients (20.8%) died in the embolization group compared to 11 (22%) in the surgery group.

METHODS: The association between interleukin 10 (IL-10) production and joint destruction was studied by comparing IL-10 mRNA content in synovial biopsies from seven patients with destructive joint disease and six patients with non-destructive joint disease. The IL-10 mRNA content was 0.4 +/- 0.6 arbitrary units in erosive joints compared with 2.3 +/- 1.2 arbitrary units in non-erosive joints (P:<0.03, Mann-Whitney U:-test). As this difference suggested that IL-10 production was associated with joint destruction, we tested whether the IL-10 locus determined the extent of joint damage. RESULTS: Innate differences in IL-10 production are locus-dependent. In line with these data, we showed that innate differences in IL-10 protein production were also present as differences in IL-10 mRNA levels. We tested if polymorphisms in the promoter of IL-10 were associated with the extent of joint damage. DISCUSSION: In a cohort study of female rheumatoid arthritis patients followed for 12 yr, the extent of joint destruction differed significantly between patients with different IL-10 genotypes. In patients with the -1082AA genotype who were studied prospectively, the mean increase in radiographic damage score (modified Sharp score of X-rays of hands and feet) during the first 6 yr was 9 +/- 9 per yr vs 19 +/- 16 per yr for patients with the genotype -1082GG (P:<0.02).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was approved by the local ethics committee, and all subjects gave written informed consent. MR angiography and DSA were performed in 84 patients (56 men, 28 women; age range, 61-76 years) with carotid artery stenosis at Doppler ultrasonography. Three readers reviewed the first-pass, steady-state, and combined MR data sets, and one independent observer evaluated the DSA images to assess stenosis degree, plaque morphology and ulceration, stenosis length, and tandem lesions. Interobserver agreement regarding MR angiographic findings was analyzed by using intraclass correlation and Cohen kappa coefficients. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated by using the McNemar test to determine possible significant differences (P<.05). RESULTS: Interobserver agreement regarding all MR angiogram readings was substantial.

METHODS AND RESULTS: In Group-1 (n = 92), isoproterenol (ISP) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were co-administered to provoke PV-F before and after CPVI. The site of rapid focal discharge that initiated atrial fibrillation (AF) defined PV-F versus non-PV-F. Additional 17 patients with PV-F induced by ISP+ATP before CPVI were enrolled into Group-2 and various pacing maneuvers were used in conjunction to ISP+ATP to provoke PV-F after CPVI. In Group-1, AF was induced in 47/81 (58.0%) and 16/88 (18.2%) patients before and after CPVI, respectively (P<0.01). Before CPVI, 43/47 (91.5%) of the rapid firing originated from PV.

Data were collected on patient demographics, Trauma and Injury Severity Score, days to tracheostomy, mortality, ICU LOS, total ventilator days, pneumonia, and hospital LOS. STATISTICAL ANALYSES: log-linear modeling, chi2, p<0.05. RESULTS: A total of 125,533 trauma patients were analyzed. Out of these, 82,148 patients met inclusion criteria and had complete data for analysis. There were 6,880 patients intubated at the scene, during transport, or at admission to the emergency department, with 685 receiving a temporary tracheostomy. There was a significantly higher mortality rate (48.9%) associated with patients with low Ps (<0.25) receiving early tracheostomy (ET),<4 days. Among high-Ps patients, the ET group demonstrated reduced ICU LOS, total ventilator days, pneumonia, and hospital LOS (p<0.05).",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that is highly effective in treating Gram-negative infections, but inappropriate use leads to toxicity. In 2010, the Australian Therapeutic Guidelines (Antibiotic) were revised to recommend the use of computerised methods to individualise dosing of gentamicin and optimise therapy, rather than traditional nomogram approaches.AIM: To determine whether gentamicin prescribing was compliant with the Australian Therapeutic Guidelines, version 14 (2010) in a setting where computerised dose recommendation resources and computerised decision support were available, and to determine why the resources were effective or ineffective in achieving compliance to guidelines. METHODS: During phase 1, a retrospective audit of gentamicin prescribing from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2012 (n\u2009=\u2009826) at a 320-bed teaching hospital in Sydney was undertaken. In phase 2, 12 doctors from specialties with high-volume prescribing of gentamicin were interviewed. RESULTS: Intravenous gentamicin was used in 545 cases, 81% of which were for short-term therapy (\u226448\u2009h). Doctors feared inducing toxicity in patients, but limited the dose rather than altering the dosing interval according to renal function. Of the 'continued' dosing cases, 55% went unmonitored and the computerised dose recommendation service was rarely used. Doctors were unaware of its availability despite electronic alerts accompanying prescriptions of gentamicin.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is highly prevalent in the growing U.S. Latino population. We hypothesize that MetS, with or without diabetes, is associated with progressive disability in older Mexican Americans. METHODS: Data from Mexican Americans 60-98 years old participating in the Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging (SALSA) were analyzed from baseline through 3 years (3 years of follow-up). Disability was assessed by self-reported limitations in activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental ADLs (IADLs), and mobility/strength tasks. MetS (46% of sample) was defined by National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. Diabetes (DM, 33%) was defined by fasting blood sugar>125 mg/dL, physician diagnosis, and/or medication use. Four metabolic groups were defined: MetS with diabetes (MetS+DM+, n=402); MetS without diabetes (MetS+DM-, n=330); diabetes without MetS (MetS-DM+, n=125); and neither (MetS-DM-, n=749). Generalized estimating equation (GEE) regression models were used to evaluate the effect of metabolic group on physical limitations and disability changes over time. RESULTS: Diabetes, with or without MetS, was associated with a higher percent rate of increase over 3 years in ADL and IADL disability than was no diabetes, even after controlling for demographics, body mass index (BMI), and incident disease. The mean ADL score had a 35% higher rate of increase (higher = more impairment) for the MetS+DM+ group and 68% higher for the MetS+DM- group than for the MetS-DM+ group. The mean IADL score had a 28% higher rate of increase for the MetS+DM+ group and 52% higher for the MetS+DM- group than for the MetS-DM+ group.",

Chemotherapy followed by irradiation is available in larynx and hypopharynx squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) treatment. Are results obtained in daily induction chemotherapy usefulness identical to results obtained in larynx preservation studies? PATIENTS AND METHOD: We conducted a retrospective study on patients treated at centre Oscar-Lambret, Lille, from 1986 to 1995, by chemotherapy followed by definitive radiotherapy or by surgery and radiotherapy for laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancer treatment. All patients were naive of previous head and neck SCC and a surgical treatment, requiring total laryngectomy, should be proposed with curative intent. Induction chemotherapy associated cisplatin (100 mg/m2) on day 1 and 5-fluorouracil (5FU)(1,000 mg/m2) on days 1-4 or 1-5. Irradiation was performed for responders (complete or partial>50%). If case of non-responder, patients underwent surgical treatment followed by irradiation. We compared results obtained with patients enrolled in clinical trial and with patients whom benefited from this protocol out of trial. RESULTS: Hundred-eight patients were evaluable for purposes of this study. Fifty-two patients were included in clinical trial (group 1) while 56 patients (group 2) were not. There was no statistical difference as regard neither to sex nor to node (palpable or not palpable) and metastasis status between the groups.

        "input": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In children having suffered from neonatal arterial ischemic stroke, the relationship between contralesional hand performance and structural changes in brain areas remote from the infarct site was examined. METHODS: Using voxel-based morphometry, we correlated contralesional gross manual dexterity assessed by the box and block test and whole-brain gray and white-matter volume changes on high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging in 37 7-year-old post-neonatal arterial ischemic stroke children. We also compared the volume of the identified structures with magnetic resonance imaging data of 10 typically developing age-matched children. RESULTS: Areas showing the highest positive correlation with the box and block test scores were ipsilesional mediodorsal thalamus, contralesional cerebellar lobule VIIa Crus I, and ipsilesional corticospinal tract at the level of superior corona radiata, the posterior limb of the internal capsule, and the cerebral peduncle and the ipsilesional body of corpus callosum. When compared with typically developing age-matched children, post-neonatal arterial ischemic stroke children with severe contralesional hand motor deficit exhibited significant volume reductions in these structures (except the cerebellum), whereas no differences were found with those with good manual dexterity. No negative correlation was found between box and block test scores and brain areas.",

        "input": "PURPOSE: Interaction and subgroup analyses remain controversial topics in epidemiology. A recent theoretical paper suggested that a combination of no overall treatment-outcome association and treatment effect limited to a single subgroup would imply a clinically implausible interaction, with opposite treatment effects in the two subgroups. However, this argument was based entirely on point estimates and ignored sampling error and statistical inference. METHODS: We simulated hypothetical studies in which treatment truly affected the outcome in only one subgroup, with no effect in the other subgroup. We generated 1000 random samples for three study designs (small clinical study, case-control, and large cohort), and different values of total sample size (N), relative size of the affected subgroup, and treatment effect. We estimated the frequency of significant results for tests of overall and subgroup-specific treatment effects, and treatment-by-subgroup interaction. RESULTS: Combination of statistically non-significant overall treatment effect and significant treatment-by-subgroup interaction occurred frequently, especially if the affected subgroup was proportionally smaller, even in studies with high power to detect the overall effect (e.g. in 37.1% of samples with N\u2009=\u200920\u2009000, with 600 outcomes, and an effect (odds ratio of 1.5) limited to 30% of subjects). Furthermore, in most samples with a significant interaction, subgroup analyses correctly indicated that the significant effect was limited to one subgroup.",

Side effects of PGE1 are a decrease of systemic blood pressure and prevention of thrombocyte clotting, both being undesired during repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAA). The aim of this study was to evaluate, whether intraoperative and intraarterial kidney perfusion with 4 degrees Ringer's lactate plus 1000 IU of heparin/l plus 20 micrograms PGE1/l is more effective in preventing postischaemic kidney dysfunction than cold perfusion without PGE1.

Ten patients fulfilled the criteria for this study: renal artery stenosis or occlusion was excluded by angiography pre- and postoperatively. By means of szintigraphy an at least 30% participation in renal function had to be proven for every kidney. Intraoperatively both kidneys had to be excluded from circulation simultaneously. The left kidney in each patient was perfused with 4 degrees Ringer's lactate plus 1000 IU of heparin/l plus 20 micrograms PGE1/l. The right kidney was perfused with a solution of the same temperature plus heparin but without PGE1.

Food intake from 680 meals was recorded and quantified during continuous glucose monitoring. RESULTS: The median BG excursion (DeltaBG) was higher at breakfast than at lunch or dinner (111 [81; 160] vs. 69.5 [41.5; 106]and 82.5 mg/dl [53; 119] mg/dl, P<0.0001).

Eleven women with invasive breast carcinoma were imaged with DOS tomography prior to, during, and at completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapeutic regimens. By using region of interest (ROI) analysis, the DOS measure of total tissue hemoglobin (Hb(T)) was temporally correlated with quantitative measures of existing (CD31-expressing) and tumor-induced (CD105-expressing) vessels, in pretreatment and posttreatment tissue specimens, to assess change. RESULTS: Quantified angiogenesis alone in pretreatment core biopsy specimens did not predict treatment response, but mean vessel density (MVD) and mean vessel area (MVA) of CD105-expressing vessels were significantly decreased in women with pCR (n = 7) (P<.001 and P = .003, respectively).

METHOD: As a part of the Methods for the Epidemiology of Child and Adolescent Mental Disorders (MECA) Study, the authors examined epidemiological survey data obtained from 1,285 children and their parents across 4 U.S. communities. Analyses examined the frequency of children's ADHD diagnosis, the extent to which medications were prescribed, as well as the provision of other services (e.g., psychosocial treatments, school-based educational interventions).

Only 12.5% of children meeting ADHD criteria had been treated with stimulants during the previous 12 months. Some children who had been prescribed stimulants did not meet full ADHD diagnostic criteria, but these children manifested high levels of ADHD symptoms, suggesting that the medication had been appropriately prescribed.

RESULTS: Diabetic patients included a higher proportion of females, a greater preoperative presence of renal insufficiency, a higher rate of three vessel disease, and reception of a greater number of grafts (mean: 2.5 versus 2.4) and an internal thoracic artery graft (68% versus 58%). Hospital mortality was not significantly different (2.1% vs 1.0%: ns). An actuarial analysis revealed a significantly unfavorable long-term survival in the diabetic group (59.6%) at 14 years, compared with the nondiabetic group (73.4%), however diabetic patients with an internal thoracic artery graft had a favorable long-term survival (82.0%) at 13 years, and this finding was almost identical to that of nondiabetic patients with an internal thoracic artery graft (88.5%).",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Prehospital, small-volume resuscitation of combat casualties with a synthetic colloid (6% hydroxyethyl starch [HES] 670/0.75) has been recommended when blood or blood components are unavailable. We studied hemostatic effects of a newer synthetic colloid (6% HES, 130/0.4) compared with either a natural colloid (albumin) or to crystalloids in an uncontrolled hemorrhage model. METHODS: Spontaneously breathing New Zealand white rabbits (3.4 \u00b1 0.1 kg) were anesthetized, instrumented, and subjected to a splenic injury with uncontrolled bleeding. Fifteen minutes after injury, rabbits were in shock (mean arterial pressure [MAP] = 26 \u00b1 1.3 mm Hg, and received colloids (6% HES, 130/0.4 or 5% albumin at 15 mL/kg), or crystalloids (normal saline at 30 mL/kg or 5% hypertonic saline at 7.5 mL/kg) for resuscitation in two intravenous bolus injections (15 minutes apart) to raise their MAP to 65 mm Hg, n = 9/group. Animals were monitored for 2.5 hours or until death, and blood losses were measured. Blood samples were analyzed for arterial blood gas, complete blood count, and coagulation measures. RESULTS: There were no differences among groups in baseline measures and initial hemorrhage volume (11.9 \u00b1 0.6 mL/kg) at 15 minutes postinjury. Twenty minutes after fluid resuscitation (1 hour postinjury), MAP was higher in the colloid groups (6% HES, 130/0.4 and 5% albumin) compared with the crystalloid groups (normal saline and hypertonic saline).

Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) administered to the resection bed may improve local tumor control. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent PD at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital (TJUH) between 1995 and 2005 to identify patients who underwent resection with and without IORT. Data collected included age, gender, complications, margin status, stage, survival, and recurrence. Unadjusted analyses of the IORT and non-IORT groups were performed using Fisher's chi-square method for discrete variables and Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables. To account for biases in patient selection for IORT, a propensity score was calculated for each patient and adjusted statistical analyses were performed for survival and recurrence outcomes. RESULTS: Between January 1995 and November 2005, 122 patients underwent PD for periampullary tumors, including 99 pancreatic cancers. Of this group, 37 patients were treated with IORT, and there was adequate follow-up information for a group of 46 patients who underwent PD without IORT. The IORT group contained a higher percentage of Stage IIB or higher tumors (65%) than in the non-IORT group (39.1%), though differences in stage did not reach significance (P = .16). There was a nonsignificant decrease in the rate of LRR in patients who had IORT (39% non-IORT vs. 23% IORT, P = .19).

Adrenalectomy is effective in patients with proven unilateral hypersecretion of aldosterone whereas pharmacotherapy is indicated in bilateral forms of the disease. We can meet the opinion that in patients with confirmed primary aldosteronism and finding ofsuprarenal adenoma>or = 1 cm on computed tomography (CT) scanning, adrenalectomy can be recommended without further investigation. On the other hand we can perform adrenal venous sampling (AVS) to prove unilateral overproduction of aldosterone.

The echoacardiographic parameters of septum- and PFO-morphology determined before the intervention were analysed with regard to choosing the optimal device-system for transcatheter PFO-closure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Transoesophageal echocardiography combined with application of contrast-media was performed in 31 patients before, during and after PFO-closure by using the PFO-Star-Device. The pre-interventional morphological parameters were compared with the result after PFO-closure. RESULTS: Quantitative contrast-bubble-shunting, PFO-channel-length and Vena contracta detected by colour flow Doppler do not show any correlation. PFO-channel-length in cases with small angles between aorta and septum seems to be associated with higher risk of clinically irrelevant device-shift as well as residual shunt.",

Though various low thresholds Z score values have been proposed as suggestive of a high likelihood of secondary osteoporosis, they appear to have only limited discriminatory value in identifying a secondary cause. INTRODUCTION: Many patients with osteoporosis have significant secondary contributors towards their bone loss. The sensitivity and diagnostic utility of using Z score thresholds to screen for secondary osteoporosis have not yet been convincingly demonstrated nor has there been any previous attempt to estimate the prevalence of secondary osteoporosis in South East Asia. We aimed to study the prevalence of commonly recognized contributors and to determine the discriminatory ability of Z score thresholds in screening for them in Singaporean men and post-menopausal women with osteoporosis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the records of 400 patients of RCC, who underwent treatment at our institution between January 1988 and February 2001. These patients were evaluated pre-operatively with ultrasonograms (USG) and contrast enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. USG or CT scans of these cases were reviewed for presence of pathology in the pelvis, which were classified into 3 categories viz; benign and likely to be insignificant, benign and likely to be significant; and malignant. RESULTS: Of the 400 cases, 114 were stage I, 68 were stage II, 99 were stage III and 119 were stage IV. In all patients, tumour was identified in the kidney on preoperative CT scan. Fourteen patients (3.5%) had an abnormality on pelvic CT. Five (1.25%) had category 1, three (0.75%) had category 2 and six (1.5%) had category 3 abnormality on pelvic CT.

Swine models of extended hepatectomy have been developed for studying SFSS and its different treatment options. Although portal inflow modulation (PIM) by splenectomy or splenic artery ligation (SAL) has been proposed in humans to prevent SFSS, such procedures have not yet been evaluated in swine. OBJECTIVES: The present study was designed to evaluate modifications in splanchnic haemodynamics yielded by extended hepatectomy with and without PIM in swine. METHODS: Nineteen animals underwent 70% hepatectomy (H70, n = 7), 90% hepatectomy (H90, n = 7) or sham laparotomy (H0, n = 5). Haemodynamic measurements were performed at baseline, after hepatectomy and after PIM by SAL and splenectomy. RESULTS: Portal vein flow increased after both H70 (273 ml/min/100 g versus 123 ml/min/100 g; P = 0.016) and H90 (543 ml/min/100 g versus 124 ml/min/100 g; P = 0.031), but the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) increased only after H90 (10.0 mmHg versus 3.7 mmHg; P = 0.016).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the Scopus database, h-indices were calculated for a random sample of academic radiologists with the rank of professor. Using the NIH tool Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools Expenditures and Reports, we determined the number, classification, and total years of NIH grant funding as principal investigator for each radiologist. Differences in h-index, sorted by funding status, were determined using Wilcoxon's tests. Associations between h-index and funding status were determined using logistic regression. Significant correlations between h-index and grant metrics were determined using Spearman's \u03c1. RESULTS: Among 210 professors of radiology, 48 (23%) secured at least one NIH grant.

We conducted interviews with nurse managers to obtain data regarding hospital policies, practices, and the presence of laborists, and linked this information with patient-level hospital discharge data for all deliveries in 2012. RESULTS: Of 248 childbirth hospitals, 239 (96.4%) participated; 182 community hospitals were studied, and these hospitals provided 221,247 deliveries for analysis. Hospitals with laborists (n = 43, 23.6%) were busier, had more clinical resources, and cared for higher-risk patients. There was no difference in the unadjusted primary cesarean rate for laborist vs nonlaborist hospitals (11.3% vs 11.7%; P = .382) but there was a higher maternal composite morbidity rate (14.4% vs 12.0%; P = .0006). After adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics, there were no differences in laborist vs nonlaborist hospitals for any of the specified outcomes. Hospitals with laborists had higher attempted trial of labor after cesarean rates, and lower repeat cesarean rates (90.9% vs 95.9%; P<.0001). However, among women attempting trial of labor after cesarean, there was no difference in the vaginal birth after cesarean success rate.",

        "input": "PURPOSE: Augmentation of a deficient nasal dorsum remains a challenge in rhinoplasty. Different methods and materials have been described in the literature. The purpose of this study was to present the authors' experiences using a composite graft consisting of conchal cartilage and retroauricular fascia for dorsal augmentation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with moderate to severe dorsal deficiencies were included in this study. The postauricular sulcus was used to gain access to the auricular cartilage and the retroauricular fascia. If the dorsal deficiency was moderate, then 1 layer of conchal cartilage was used. In more severe deficiencies, the cartilage pieces were superimposed, and a multilayer conchal graft was used. To fix the cartilage segments to each other, 6-0 polydioxanone (PDS) suture was used. Then, the cartilage segment was fixed to the retroauricular fascia with 6-0 PDS suture. The nasal dorsum was undermined carefully to create adequate space for chondrofascial graft placement. After performing required maneuvers for solving the functional disorders, tip plasty, and the lateral nasal wall osteotomy, the prepared chondrofascial graft was placed in the dorsal pocket. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (5 men and 9 women) participated in this study. The average follow-up duration was 25.4 months (range, 16 to 42 months). The patients' age ranged from 14 to 54 years (average, 25.9 yr). Follow-up showed no cases of infection, hematoma, major graft resorption, asymmetric graft resorption, and displacement. The patients were satisfied with the results.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: Among 185 patients undergoing PVI, 52 reported no significant improvement in their clinical course. We analyzed PV conduction in 51 PVs (15 patients) at repeat PVI. All PVs were isolated with either RF (30 W, 50 degrees C, 60 seconds) or cryoablation (-80 degrees C for 5 minutes). At repeat study, 42 of the previously isolated 51 PVs had return of conduction. All patients had recurrent conduction in>or =2 PVs, with only 1 non-PV focus identified. The mean number of RF applications required to re-isolate the PVs was fewer at the repeat compared with the initial procedure (10+/-6 versus 4+/-2, P<0.005). Over a period of 15+/-6 months, all but 1 patient was clinically improved by the second procedure.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Although vaccination can be a useful tool for control of avian influenza epidemics, it might engender emergence of a vaccine-resistant strain. Field and experimental studies show that some avian influenza strains acquire resistance ability against vaccination. We investigated, in the context of the emergence of a vaccine-resistant strain, whether a vaccination program can prevent the spread of infectious disease. We also investigated how losses from immunization by vaccination imposed by the resistant strain affect the spread of the disease. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We designed and analyzed a deterministic compartment model illustrating transmission of vaccine-sensitive and vaccine-resistant strains during a vaccination program. We investigated how the loss of protection effectiveness impacts the program. Results show that a vaccination to prevent the spread of disease can instead spread the disease when the resistant strain is less virulent than the sensitive strain. If the loss is high, the program does not prevent the spread of the resistant strain despite a large prevalence rate of the program. The epidemic's final size can be larger than that before the vaccination program. We propose how to use poor vaccines, which have a large loss, to maximize program effects and describe various program risks, which can be estimated using available epidemiological data.",

It is unknown whether respiratory retraining (ventilation-feedback [VF] training) can affect exercise-induced dynamic hyperinflation and increase exercise tolerance. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether patients with COPD would achieve longer exercise duration if randomized to a combination of exercise training plus VF training than either form of training on its own. METHODS: A total of 64 patients randomized to 1 of 3 groups: VF plus exercise (n = 22), exercise alone (n = 20), and VF alone (n = 22). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Exercise duration before and after 36 training sessions and exercise-induced dynamic hyperinflation and respiratory pattern before and after training were measured. In the 49 patients who completed training, duration of constant work-rate exercise was 40.0 (+/- 20.4) minutes (mean +/- SD) with VF plus exercise, 31.5 (+/- 17.3) minutes with exercise alone, and 16.1 (+/- 19.3) minutes with VF alone. Exercise duration was longer in VF plus exercise than in VF alone (P<0.0001), but did not reach predetermined statistical significance when VF plus exercise was compared with exercise alone (P = 0.022) (because of multiple comparisons, P</= 0.0167 was used for statistical significance). After training, exercise-induced dynamic hyperinflation, measured at isotime, in VF plus exercise was less than in exercise alone (P = 0.014 for between-group changes) and less than in VF alone (P = 0.019 for between-group changes).

The main reasons identified by clinicians only partially reflect the reasons given by patients. METHODS: Seventy-two subjects who were identified from biochemistry laboratory data as receiving lithium for an affective disorder and who gave written informed consent, completed the 'Reasons for Stopping Medication' questionnaire. Forty-one clinicians involved in treating these 72 patients also completed the same questionnaire. Ratings on the 'Reasons for Stopping Medication' questionnaire were compared between adherent and non-adherent patients and between patients and their clinicians. RESULTS: Adherent (n=39) and previously non-adherent patients (n=33) showed a high level of concordance in their rank ordering of reasons for considering stopping taking lithium (Kendall's W=0.059; P=0.001), with 'bothered by the idea that moods were controlled by medication', 'bothered by the idea of a chronic illness' and 'felt depressed' being the most commonly endorsed items.

        "input": "OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence, severity and distress from physical symptoms and the prevalence of anxiety and depression in patients about to undergo chemotherapy for potentially curable cancers; and to explore the presence of symptom clusters and investigate their relationships with anxiety and depression. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Cross-sectional survey of 192 patients with breast or gastrointestinal cancers or lymphoma before first ever chemotherapy treatment with curative intent. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale to assess anxiety and depression and the Chemotherapy Symptom Assessment Scale to measure physical symptom prevalence, severity and distress (\"bother\"). RESULTS: Prevalence of anxiety was 45% and depression 25%. The most prevalent physical symptoms were pain (48%), feeling unusually tired (45%) and difficulty sleeping (45%). Physical symptoms rated as most severe were pain (28%), difficulty sleeping (26%) and feeling unusually tired (19%). Physical symptoms causing the most distress were pain (39%), constipation (18%) and nausea (16%). Factor analysis of symptom distress scores indicated that five factors explained 36.7% of the variance and included: gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, pain), general malaise (tiredness, feeling weak, headaches), emotional (feeling depressed, feeling anxious), nutritional (changes to appetite, weight loss or gain) and general physical (mouth/throat problems, shortness of breath). Regression analysis indicated that symptom distress for the malaise (beta = 1.46; P<0.001), nutritional (beta = 0.70; P<0.05) and general physical (beta = 0.62; P<0.001) factors were associated with anxiety and depression.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: This study investigated the mediating role of general and maternal-specific dysfunctional cognitions, in the relationship between non-cognitive risk factors and postnatal depressive symptomatology. METHODS: An Australian community sample comprising 406 postnatal women responded to the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS), the Maternal Attitudes Questionnaire (MAQ), the Vulnerable Personality Style Questionnaire (VPSQ) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). They also responded to several questions related to perinatal and postnatal experiences. RESULTS: Path analysis demonstrated that different mediational pathways operated for different risk factors. The relationship between having a difficult baby and postnatal depression was fully mediated by maternal-specific dysfunctional cognitions (MAQ scores), whereas the relationship between past history of depression and postnatal depression was partially mediated by general dysfunctional cognitions (DAS scores). Finally, the relationship between a vulnerable personality and depressive symptomatology was mediated by both DAS and MAQ scores. LIMITATIONS: The study employed a correlational design. Thus, all inferences regarding possible causal pathways are tentative. In addition, the generalisability of these findings to other populations needs to be demonstrated in future research.",

Therefore, correction of IR is a relevant therapeutic target.We performed the current trial to evaluate whether 12- month metformin therapy improves vascular stiffness in patients with NAFLD and to assess if this improvement is associated with change in glucose control, insulin resistance or circulating adiponectin. METHODS: In randomized, placebo controlled study, 63 patients with NAFLD were assigned to one of two groups: Group 1 received daily metformin; Group 2 received placebo. Central aortic augmentation index (AI) was performed using SphygmoCor (version 7.1, AtCor Medical, Sydney, Australia) at baseline, at 4-and 12-month treatment period. Metabolic parameters, insulin resistance markers and serum adiponectin levels were determined. RESULTS: In placebo group: AI did not improve during the treatment period. Liver function and adiponectin levels did not change during the study.In multiple linear regression analysis, the independent predictors of arterial stiffness improvement were metformin treatment and increase in circulating adiponectin levels.Among metformin treated patients: AI decreased significantly during the study.

This study was performed to evaluate the growth and remodeling potentials of a decellularized heart valve. METHODS: In 4 juvenile sheep (age 12 +/- 1 weeks) with a weight of 24.3 +/- 4.4 kg, a 17-mm diameter decellularized porcine valve was implanted as pulmonary valve replacement. Valve growth was evaluated by transthoracic echocardiography. At explantation, valves were evaluated by gross examination, light microscopy (hematoxylin and eosin, von Kossa, Sirius red, Weigert and Gomori staining), electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Atomic absorption spectrometry was performed to evaluate calcium content. RESULTS: All animals showed fast recovery. The mean follow-up was 9.0 +/- 1.8 months. All sheep at least doubled their weight (54.3 +/- 9.2 kg). Echocardiography showed no regurgitation and a flow velocity of 0.7 +/- 0.1 m/s at the latest follow-up. The valve diameter increased from 17.6 +/- 0.5 to 27.5 +/- 2.1 mm (p<0.018). Gross examination showed a similar wall thickness of the implanted valve and native pulmonary wall, with smooth and pliable leaflets. Histology showed a monolayer of endothelial cells, fibroblast ingrowth and production of new collagen. No calcification was seen at von Kossa staining, confirmed by low calcium content levels of the valve wall and leaflets at atomic absorption spectrometry.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Mediterranean lifestyle has long been hailed as protective against certain risk behaviours and diseases. Mediterranean drinking patterns of moderate alcohol consumption as part of daily life have often been assumed to protect young people from harmful alcohol consumption, in contrast to Northern European drinking patterns. Nightlife environments are strong related to alcohol and drugs use, and other health risk behaviours but few cross-national studies have been undertaken amongst young Europeans frequenting bars and nightclubs. This study aims to understand differences in nightlife risk-taking behaviours between young nightlife users from Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean cultures, including alcohol and illicit drug use, unprotected sex, violence and driving under the influence of alcohol. METHODS: A total of 1363 regular nightlife users aged 16-35 years were surveyed in nine European cities by means of a self-reported questionnaire. Sample selection was done through respondent driven sampling techniques. RESULTS: after controlling for demographic variables, no differences among the Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean samples were found in current alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, or cocaine use, neither in violent behaviours, but Northern people were more likely to get drunk [adjusted odds ratio (AOR)\u2009=\u20090.53], while Mediterranean were more likely to have unprotected sex (AOR\u2009=\u20092.01) and to drive drunken (AOR\u2009=\u20095.86).",

The objective of this study was to present the different imaging and clinical findings of 17 patients with CBPS, their genetic background, and the occurrence of prenatal injury during their pregnancies. METHODS: We evaluated 17 consecutive patients with CBPS and divided them into two groups according to the imaging findings: (a) diffuse polymicrogyria around the sylvian fissure and (b) posterior polymicrogyria at the posterior parietal regions. They were systematically interviewed regarding history of prenatal events during their pregnancies, family history of speech difficulties, epilepsy, or other neurologic abnormality. RESULTS: There were seven women, ages ranging from 3 to 41 years (mean, 11.5; median, 7 years). Seven patients had bilateral posterior parietal polymicrogyria (BPPP), and 10 had diffuse bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria. All seven patients with BPPP had only minor speech difficulties, none had epilepsy, and all but one had a family history of epilepsy or cortical dysgenesis.

DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blind trial. PATIENTS: Twenty-three patients at risk for renal dysfunction were entered into the study. Five patients were later withdrawn. Study data for the remaining 18 patients were: mean age 55 yrs; mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score of 18; mean weight 71 kg). The following conditions were present: mechanical ventilation (n = 17 [inverse-ratio ventilation, n = 6]); inotrope administration (n = 11); sepsis (n = 13); and adult respiratory distress syndrome or multiple organ failure syndrome (n = 9). INTERVENTIONS: The study patients were administered dopamine (200 micrograms/min), dobutamine (175 micrograms/min), and placebo (5% dextrose) over 5 hrs each in a randomized order. Ventilator settings, fluid management, and preexisting inotropic support were not altered during the study.

Fasting serum leptin concentrations were assayed in a large number of subjects from the same area, to determine their distribution as plotted against the standard deviation score (z-score) of BMI. DESIGN, SUBJECTS AND MEASUREMENTS: Height and weight were recorded from 31170 subjects (16175 male and 14995 female), aged 3-18 y, to construct BMI charts of children and adolescents from central Italy. Percentiles and z-score were calculated using the LMS method of Cole. Serum leptin concentrations were assayed in 1929 subjects (996 male and 933 female) after overnight fasting. RESULTS: BMI percentiles of central Italy were higher than those from standards of other European and USA populations. When plotted against the z-score of BMI, serum leptin values were distributed according to an exponential curve, showing a steep pattern and a wide distribution, as BMI values increased. The hypothesis of the existence of two subgroups, based on a different relation between leptin and BMI, was verified and a separation point between the two subgroups was identified using cluster analysis, discriminant analysis and a novel method developed by our group, hereafter referred to as 'regression clustering'. This method allows identification of the value of the independent variable (z-score of BMI) which can be taken as a separation point. This analysis provided the best results and indicated the following separation points: central Italy standard, z-score = 0.72 (76.4th percentile) for males and z-score = 0.69 (75.5th percentile) for females; French standard (the one suggested for a European population by the European Childhood Obesity Group, ECOG), z-score = 0.75 (78.2nd percentile) for males and z-score = 0.73 (77.3rd percentile) for females.",

These databases are used by medical professionals or law enforcement officials to identify patients with prescription drug use patterns indicative of abuse or providers engaging in illegal activities. Most states have implemented PMPs in an attempt to curb prescription drug abuse and diversion. However, assessment of their impact on drug abuse is only beginning. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between PMPs and opioid misuse over time in two drug abuse surveillance data sources. METHODS: Data from the RADARS\u00ae System Poison Center and Opioid Treatment surveillance databases were used to obtain measures of abuse and misuse of opioids. Repeated measures negative binomial regression was applied to quarterly surveillance data (from 2003 to mid-2009) to estimate and compare opioid abuse and misuse trends. PMP presence was modeled as a time varying covariate for each state. RESULTS: Results support an association between PMPs and mitigated opioid abuse and misuse trends. Without a PMP in place, Poison Center intentional exposures increased, on average, 1.9% per quarter, whereas opioid intentional exposures increase 0.2% (P = 0.036) per quarter with a PMP in place. Opioid treatment admissions increase, on average, 4.9% per quarter in states without a PMP vs 2.6% (P = 0.058) in states with a PMP.

OBJECTIVES: Establishment of a mouse PPI paradigm in which typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs directly improve a low performance PPI. METHODS: Three strains of mice--C57Bl/6J, 129S6/SvEvTac and DBA/2J--were tested in a startle paradigm with three prepulse intensities, 2, 4 and 8 dB above background. RESULTS: Under these conditions, risperidone (0, 0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg i.p.) and clozapine (0, 1, 3 and 9 mg/kg i.p.) improved PPI in all three strains, with order of effect in DBA/2J>129S6SvEvTac>C57Bl/6J. The DBA/2J strain showed larger PPI-enhancing effects, without disturbing the basal startle response. Two alpha7 nicotinic receptor agonists, GTS-21 (1-10 mg/kg i.p.) and AR-R17779 (1-10 mg/kg i.p.) were inactive in the PPI procedure in DBA/2J mice.",

With the ongoing changes in these predisposing factors, it is possible that the clinical picture of bladder calculi will show additional changes. Nevertheless, few contemporary series of bladder calculi in published English reports have addressed these issues. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 328 patients who underwent surgical therapy for bladder calculi at our institution from January 1995 to June 2005. RESULTS: Acute urinary retention was the most common presenting symptom (n = 221, 67%). Patients who presented with urinary retention were younger (37 versus 48 years, P<0.001), had a greater incidence of recent renal colic (40% versus 19%, P<0.01), and had a lower incidence of bladder outlet obstruction (14% versus 37%, P<0.001) compared with the nonretention group. However, previous stone passage did not influence the probability of presenting with urinary retention. Small bladder stones were associated with a greater likelihood of presenting with urinary retention. The retention group had greater incidence of stones less than 1 cm in diameter compared with the nonretention group (72% versus 39%, P<0.001). Finally, calcium oxalate was found in 78% of patients with bladder calculi.",

It is a difficult question for occupational and primary care physicians who must often address whether a worker with an inguinal hernia should be restricted from work requiring lifting of heavy objects. METHODS: To evaluate the possible work-relatedness of inguinal hernias, a cross-sectional study was performed. The goal of the study was to determine hernia incidence according to occupation with the Annual Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses from the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 1994. Hernia incidence rates (per 10,000 workers) for industry and occupation categories were calculated with the estimates of the number of hernias in males and the employed male workers from the Current Population Survey. Rate ratios (RR) of hernia incidence rates were calculated. RESULTS: In 1994, an estimated 30, 791 work-related hernias in males were reported by US private establishments.

Indications were: infiltration of the pulmonary vein in the left atrium (four cases), one case where the tumor (a paraganglioma apparently located in the subcarinal space) was actually in the atrium wall, one mediastinal liposarcoma with massive infiltration of the pericardium and the main pulmonary artery, and three tracheal tumors (2 cylindromas and 1 carcinoid). RESULTS: Indication for CPB was decided preoperatively in 7 cases and intraoperatively in the other 2 patients. Cardiac infiltration was confirmed with intraoperative transesophageal cardiac echography in 2 patients, which proved to be very useful. Concerning postoperative complications, one patient died intraoperatively because it was impossible to stop the CPB after reconstruction of the bifurcation of the main pulmonary artery. Although the duration of the operation was significantly increased by the use of cardiopulmonary by-pass, it did not influence postoperative recovery in any of the other eight patients, as far as bleeding or infection was concerned.

Although it has been assumed that experienced nurses perceive less role discrepancy than inexperienced nurses, either because the former adjust themselves to their actual practice or because they have the expertise to improve their practice, this assumption has not been tested. METHODS: A survey design was used and the data were collected in 2003. Selected items from the Jefferson Survey of Attitudes Toward Physician-Nurse Inventory and the Staff Nurse Role Conception Inventory were administered to 216 Registered Nurses in Victoria, Australia to measure their perceptions of ideal and actual nursing roles. Data were analysed using a t-test and regression analysis. RESULTS: Nurses with more clinical experience rated their ideal and actual nursing roles more positively than those with less experience. However, the results showed that both groups of nurses experienced the same degree of role discrepancy. Both groups perceived strong role discrepancy in the areas of organizational decision-making and provision of patient education. Experienced nurses also perceived moderate role discrepancy in developing nursing care plans and in the freedom to initiate referrals.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Acellular matrix was obtained by excision of the whole ureter of donor dogs that were sacrificed and not included in the study group. Retrieved ureters were treated to have complete cell lysis, while maintaining the fiber framework. The study included 10 mongrel dogs in which a 3 cm segment was excised from 1 ureter and replaced by a tube of acellular matrix of the same length and width. The new tube was sutured proximal and distal by watertight interrupted sutures around a 5Fr Double-J stent (Medical Engineering Corp., New York, New York) that remained for 6 weeks. Excretory urography was done 1 and 2 weeks after stent removal and the dogs were then sacrificed. Before sacrifice the ureter was exposed and carefully examined, and the whole specimen was excised for histopathological examination. RESULTS: All dogs survived surgery except 1, which died 1 week postoperatively of a malpositioned stent and urinary ascites. There was no clinically apparent postoperative complications during the presence or after the removal of the ureteral stents. One week after stent removal excretory urography showed ipsilateral mild to moderate hydroureteronephrosis in 3 dogs and no dye excretion in 6 with a normal contralateral kidney. One week later no dye excretion was detected in all except 1 dog, which showed more radiological deterioration. At the time of sacrifice there was moderate to marked hydroureteronephrosis above the level of the new tube in all dogs. Although the graft was intact in all subjects, marked shrinkage was observed in the proximal and distal segments of the graft. The proximal segment was thinner than the distal segment.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Although hemifundoplication may prevent gastroesophageal reflux after esophagomyotomy for achalasia, it may also lead to persistent dysphagia in these patients with esophageal aperistalsis. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 51 consecutive patients (mean age 47.5 +/- 12.6 years) who had laparoscopic esophagomyotomy for achalasia by our group between August 1995 and January 2001. In 29 patients (57%) an anterior hemifundoplication was added to the esophagomyotomy. In 22 patients (43%), no wrap was added. Patients scored (0 = none; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe) symptom severity (dysphagia, regurgitation, heartburn, chest pain) preoperatively and postoperatively. Weight gain, use of gastrointestinal (GI) medication, tolerance to food, and patient satisfaction were also assessed. RESULTS: Mean patient follow-up was 33 months, and there were no operative deaths. Four patients were converted to open operation (8%).

It is reported that 60-80 per cent of diagnosis is based on history taking, yet there is little published data advising on the best method for medical students to initially attain and further refine these core skills during their medical degree. METHODS: Medical students interviewed two patients: using an open interview first, based on the Calgary-Cambridge approach, and then using a structured pro forma. The students' medical data were assessed by a senior lecturer, and their communication skills were assessed by a behavioural scientist and by the patients. RESULTS: An exact Wilcoxon paired signed rank test was conducted to determine whether there was a difference between the open interview and pro forma methods for history taking and communication skills. The test yielded p-values of 0.0017 and 0.069, respectively, with the pro forma method providing a statistically significantly higher history-taking score and communication score than the open interview method.

For severe hip-joint infections, the Girdlestone arthroplasty has been an established treatment option for many decades. We describe functional midterm results after treatment of haematological and postoperative hip-joint infections. METHODS: From 2000 to 2010, 24 patients underwent surgical treatment for 27 hip-joint empyemas. The surgical procedures included radical debridement, implantation of local antibiotic beads and soft tissue management. Besides clinical, laboratory and imaging parameters, we analysed the Harris hip score (HHS). RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (26 hips) were followed up after a mean of 30 (3.1-126.8) months. The study group consists of 12 men and 11 women, with an average height of 1.71 m, weight of 84.7 kg and body mass index (BMI) of 28.6 kg/m(2). Hip-joint empyema was due to haematological septic spread in eight patients, surgery related in 12 hips and other causes in six cases. One patient died due to septic complications during the hospital stay. Intraoperative bacterial culture was positive in 50%, with Staphylococcus aureus as the most common organism (n = 11). Average hospital stay was 35 days. HHS significantly improved from 18.2 preoperatively to 47.8 at follow-up. Functional results were mainly poor, but pain relief increased significantly. The infection control rate was 96% with four (15%) complications.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: The health service of China has encountered significant challenges due to inequalities in socio-economic determinants of health. HIV patients are known to suffer from social stigma, and may receive inadequate responsiveness from health providers. Before assessing the responsiveness they receive, it is important to know their expectations. We aimed to compare levels of expectation towards the healthcare service among HIV and non-HIV patients with adjustment for socio-economic factors. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted during January and February, 2015 among two consecutive groups of HIV positive and non-HIV patients in two hospitals in Kunming, China. Patients' expectation towards eight domains of health system responsiveness was measured using 40 vignettes; five per domain. Each vignette was ranked from 1 \"very good\" to 5 \"very bad\", and the responses were summed to obtain a total score for each domain. Differences in total scores were compared between the two groups and adjusted for other factors using multiple linear regression. RESULTS: The three domains with the highest scores, reflecting high expectation, were prompt attention, basic amenities and choice. Adjusted for other factors, HIV patients had significantly lower levels of expectation in all domains compared to the non-HIV group. Age was associated with the basic amenities domain, with young adults having higher expectations than other age groups. Minority ethnic groups had lower expectation towards dignity, prompt attention and autonomy domains compared to Han ethnicity. Those who lived in a home with 2-4 family members had higher expectations towards confidentiality than those who lived alone.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: In the 13C-octanoate breath test, the shape of the 13CO2 excretion curve in the ascending portion reflects a pattern of gastric emptying (GE). Recent scintigraphic studies have revealed an overall delay in solid GE in fertile women compared with men. However, it remains unknown whether women have a different GE pattern compared with men. As a symptomatic delay in solid GE is specific to the female gender, it could be hypothesized that the 13CO2 excretion curve is different in shape between genders. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Because the ascending gradient of the 13CO2 excretion curve is often biphasic, the dual function of y(t) = ( a1 . tb1 + a2 . tb2) e(-K.t) was applied to fit the breath data, where a1, b1, a2, b2, and K are constants. Assessed on the 4 h-based breath samples obtained after ingestion of a 320-kcal muffin containing 100 mg 13C-octanoate, the time versus 13CO2 excretion curve was created from 31 adult volunteers (15 men and 16 women). The curve shape was characterized by the dual function, and was compared between genders. RESULTS: In both genders, the ascending gradient exhibited the biphasic feature, characterized by an initial steep rise and the subsequent blunted increase, while the descending gradient followed the monotonous decay. The initial rise was steeper and the subsequent increase was more blunted in women than in men.",

This study was designed to test the hypothesis that increased O2(.-) production, more than diminished nitric oxide (NO) generation, plays a critical role in endothelial dysfunction present in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). METHODS: The study was performed in 30-week-old normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and SHR. In addition, 16-week-old SHR were treated with oral irbesartan (average dose 20 mg/kg per day) for 14 weeks (SHR-I). Aortic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADH/NADPH) oxidase activity was determined by use of chemiluminescence with lucigenin. Aortic constitutive nitric oxide synthase (cNOS) activity was determined by measuring the conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline. Vascular responses to acetylcholine were determined by isometric tension studies. RESULTS: Whereas systolic blood pressure (SBP) was significantly increased in SHR compared with WKY, no differences were observed in SBP between SHR-I and WKY. In SHR compared with WKY, we found significantly greater NADH/NADPH-driven O2(.-) production, similar cNOS-mediated NO production and an impaired vasodilation in response to acetylcholine. Treated SHR had similar NADH/NADPH oxidase activity and significantly lower cNOS activity than the untreated SHR.",

We present our experience in patients with one or more episodes of sudden death associated with documented ventricular fibrillation or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and severe operable coronary artery disease who underwent defibrillator implant at the time of bypass surgery. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-eight consecutive patients (age 63 +/- 8 years) were included in this study. Eighteen of the 58 patients had no evidence of previous myocardial infarction. The mean ejection fraction was 37 +/- 13%. All patients underwent electrophysiologic study before and after revascularization. At the time of first defibrillator discharge, each patient was reevaluated to exclude the presence of ischemia. The benefits of defibrillator implant were estimated comparing the projected survival based upon defibrillator discharge preceded by syncope or presyncope with survival curves generated including total death and sudden plus cardiac death. After a mean follow-up of 4.6 +/- 2 years, 22 patients received appropriate shocks preceded by syncope or presyncope, and an additional 19 patients received asymptomatic shocks. At 4 years, survival free of total death was 71.2%, and the projected survival was 58.8% (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that ejection fraction lower than 30% and induction of arrhythmia with one or two extrastimuli (S2, S3) were independent predictors for defibrillator discharge.",

The current study analyzed this proposed dose adjustment. METHODS: We reviewed 99 consecutive patients with lower extremity melanomas treated by ILI at our institution between May 1998 and February 2009. Toxicity and outcomes were tested for correlation with differences between administered dose and calculated adjusted dose, both in mg and mg/L, and with differences between actual limb volume and calculated adjusted limb volume.

METHODS: A total of 176 children residing in a semiurban slum area in southern India were enrolled preweaning and received either bottled (n = 90) or municipal (n = 86) drinking water based on residence in specific streets. Weekly surveillance visits were conducted until children reached their second birthday. Stool samples were collected every month and during diarrheal episodes, and were tested for the presence of Cryptosporidium species by polymerase chain reaction. Differences in the incidence of cryptosporidiosis between bottled and municipal water groups were compared using Poisson survival models, and a propensity score model was developed to adjust for the effect of potential confounders. RESULTS: A total of 186 episodes of cryptosporidiosis, mostly asymptomatic, were observed in 118 (67%) children during the follow-up period at a rate of 0.59 episodes per child-year. Diarrhea associated with Cryptosporidium species tended to be longer in duration and more severe.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Breast carcinoma survivors are the largest segment of the expanding cancer survivor community. As a result, there has been increasing discussion of the safety and efficacy of hormone replacement therapy for women with a past history of breast carcinoma. Little is known about the willingness of older breast carcinoma survivors to accept hormone replacement therapy for the alleviation of menopausal symptoms (such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and urinary incontinence) or for reduction in the risk of serious heart disease or osteoporotic hip fracture. METHODS: A structured decision analysis interview was conducted, in which visual aids were used to describe therapy and hypothetical risks of breast carcinoma recurrence. Subjects were presented with a series of scenarios in which a hypothetical woman might be experiencing one of several menopausal symptoms or might have a reduction in the risk of serious heart disease or osteoporotic hip fracture. RESULTS: Thirty-nine disease free breast carcinoma survivors who were age 60 years or older were recruited to participate in a study that included interview and physical examination. Subjects were age 68.3 years on average and had been diagnosed with breast carcinoma an average of 3.1 years previously. The majority had received hormone replacement therapy at some point in the past. They showed high levels of functioning as measured by the RAND Short Form Health Survey. Willingness to take estrogen was evident only when the increase in the risk of breast carcinoma recurrence was small and when severe symptoms of menopause were present. Under the hypothetical conditions of this interview, 56.4% of these 39 breast carcinoma survivors would be willing to take estrogen if they had all 3 menopausal symptoms and their risk of breast carcinoma recurrence increased from 25% to 30%.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Perceived risk and attitudes about the consequences of drug use, perceptions of others expectations and self-efficacy influence the intent to try drugs and continue drug use once use has started. We examine associations between adolescents' attitudes and beliefs towards ecstasy use; because most ecstasy users have a history of marijuana use, we estimate the association for three groups of adolescents: non-marijuana/ecstasy users, marijuana users (used marijuana at least once but never used ecstasy) and ecstasy users (used ecstasy at least once). METHODS: Data from 5049 adolescents aged 12-18 years old who had complete weighted data information in Round 2 of the Restricted Use Files (RUF) of the National Survey of Parents and Youth (NSPY). Data were analyzed using jackknife weighted multinomial logistic regression models. RESULTS: Adolescent marijuana and ecstasy users were more likely to approve of marijuana and ecstasy use as compared to non-drug using youth. Adolescent marijuana and ecstasy users were more likely to have close friends who approved of ecstasy as compared to non-drug using youth. The magnitudes of these two associations were stronger for ecstasy use than for marijuana use in the final adjusted model. Our final adjusted model shows that approval of marijuana and ecstasy use was more strongly associated with marijuana and ecstasy use in adolescence than perceived risk in using both drugs.",

METHODS: One thousand eight hundred (1,800) vestibular schwannomas (VS) were operated on at Nordstadt Neurosurgical Department from 1978 to 1999 by the senior surgeon (MS). There were 1,800 tumors in 1,750 patients, 1,605 patients had unilateral tumors, 145 patients had neurofibromatosis type 2 with bilateral tumors, 195 of which were treated surgically in our unit. Preservation of the cochlear nerve was attempted when ever possible. The audiometric data are analyzed by Hannover Classification System graded in steps of 20 dB by audiometry and in steps of 10% to 30% by speech discrimination. Those data were set into relation with the Hannover tumor extension grading T1 to T4. RESULTS: Overall preservation rate was 40% with considerable differences, though, depending on the preoperative hearing quality and the tumor extension. Best results were obtained for intrameatal tumors (T1) with 56% and small intra-extrameatal tumors (T2) with 57% preservation rate. While preservation rate was at 44% in medium-sized tumors (T3), it was at 20% for T4 tumors with brainstem compression or even dislocation. However, satisfactory chances were encountered in cases with normal or good preoperative hearing, on average 54%, specifically 71% in T1, 69% in T2, 58% in T3 and 29% in T4.

Local recurrence after surgical resection is reported between 60% and 90% at 10 yr. The aim of this study was to present the problem of satellite tumors around the main tumor mass and their possible relation to local recurrence. METHODS: Twenty-nine patients with retroperitoneal tumors underwent surgical resection in our department during an 8-yr period. We reviewed their records including their preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans. RESULTS: Twenty patients had \"complete\" resections requiring seven nephrectomies, four colectomies, two splenectomies, and one appendectomy. In nine cases the resection was incomplete because of tumor invasion to vital structures. Histopathology revealed that the resected tumors were: liposarcomas (12), leiomyosarcomas (4), paragangliomas (5), malignant fibrous histiocytomas (3), other sarcomas (3), schwannoma (1), myelolipoma (1), and the malignancy grade was I in 6, grade II in 11, and grade III in 12 cases.

These and others pressures are motivating EMS planners to find innovative ways to redeploy existing EMS resources. A successful redeployment of resources implies a mechanism for more carefully matching EMS resources to need than currently exists. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the methods dispatchers currently use to assign nature codes (NCs) and severity codes (SCs) also can distinguish between patients with important sentinel conditions and those without. METHODS: This was a six-month prospective study (June to November 1997). Portland Fire Bureau (PFB) paramedic units documented dispatcher-assigned NCs and SCs and the presence or absence of study-established sentinel findings. The PFB paramedics also verified or corrected dispatcher-assigned NCs and SCs using dispatch algorithms identical to those in use at this urban dispatch center. Cross-tabulation tables (SPSS version 6.1) with chi-square statistics were established to illustrate the relationship between SC strata within specific NCs and the presence or absence of sentinel findings. RESULTS: One thousand two hundred eighty-five usable cases fell into 25 unique NCs. The designation SC 1 (emergent) was assigned by the dispatcher 307 (24%) times, SC 3 (urgent) was assigned 907 (71%) times, and SC 9 (neither emergent nor urgent) was assigned 26 (2%) times. The SC was missing 45 (3%) times. The PFB records were matched to 1,040 (82%) dispatch records. Sentinel conditions were identified in 411 (40%) of these cases. Eight (32%) of 25 NCs were stratified into two or more levels of dispatcher-determined SCs. One cross-tabulation table for each of these eight NCs showed a statistically significant relationship between the presence of a sentinel condition and the dispatcher's assignment of a higher SC.",

Loss of plantar sensation due to diabetic peripheral neuropathy and other diseases has been shown to further increase this propensity to fall. The ancient Chinese art of Tai Chi has been previously shown as a method to improve balance in healthy elderly adults. METHODS: The aim of this study was to determine if Tai Chi intervention improved both balance and plantar sensory perception in healthy elderly adults and elderly adults with diabetes and plantar sensory loss. Elderly subjects (mean +/- SD age = 73.1 +/- 5.9 years, n = 18) were tested for plantar sensory ability and several balance metrics before Tai Chi training and again after 6 months of weekly sessions. Participants were grouped by initial sensory perception scores (as measured by a vibrometer) in order to make inferences on the effects of Tai Chi on sensory perception. RESULTS: Plantar sensation results show all participants showed significant improvement in sensory ability with the 6 months of Tai Chi training.

METHODS: We recruited 60 African-American adults with type 2 diabetes who completed a 2.5-year empowerment-based diabetes self-management education and support intervention. Primary healthcare use outcomes included acute care visits, non-acute care visits and days lost to disability. Acute care was a composite score calculated from the frequency of urgent care visits, emergency department visits and hospitalizations.

These synonymous codons are not used equally; there is a Codon Usage Bias (CUB). This article will provide novel information about the origin and evolution of this bias. RESULTS: Codon Usage Bias (CUB, defined here as deviation from equal usage of synonymous codons) was studied in 113 species. The average CUB was 29.3 +/- 1.1% (S.E.M, n = 113) of the theoretical maximum and declined progressively with evolution and increasing genome complexity. A Pan-Genomic Codon Usage Frequency (CUF) Table was constructed to describe genome-wide relationships among codons. Significant correlations were found between the number of synonymous codons and (i) the frequency of the respective amino acids (ii) the size of CUB. Numerous, statistically highly significant, internal correlations were found among codons and the nucleic acids they comprise. These strong correlations made it possible to predict missing synonymous codons (wobble bases) reliably from the remaining codons or codon residues.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: When some combinations of maternal and paternal alleles have a detrimental effect on offspring fitness, females should be able to choose mates on the basis of their genetic compatibility. In numerous Hymenoptera, the sex of an individual depends of the allelic combination at a specific locus (single-locus Complementary Sex Determination), and in most of these species individuals that are homozygous at this sexual locus develop into diploid males with zero fitness. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this paper, we tested the hypothesis of genetic incompatibility avoidance by investigating sib-mating avoidance in the solitary wasp parasitoid, Venturia canescens. In the context of mate choice we show, for the first time in a non-social hymenopteran species, that females can avoid mating with their brothers through kin recognition. In \"no-choice\" tests, the probability a female will mate with an unrelated male is twice as high as the chance of her mating with her brothers. In contrast, in choice tests in small test arenas, no kin discrimination effect was observed. Further experiments with male extracts demonstrate that chemical cues emanating from related males influence the acceptance rate of unrelated males.",

However, there has been concern that metastasis from extra-adrenal primary malignancies which contain high lipid content such as clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) could mimic adrenal adenomas. PURPOSE: To evaluate the ability of MR to differentiate adrenal adenoma from metastasis using chemical-shift imaging and MR feature analysis in patients with clear cell RCC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was institutional review board-approved; informed consent was waived. Eleven patients with 13 metastases and 13 patients with 15 adrenal adenomas in patients with clear cell RCC for evaluation of an adrenal mass underwent MR. Signal intensity on in- and opposed-phases, signal intensity index (SII), size, T2 SI, cystic change, necrosis, and hemorrhage were evaluated. Statistical analyses included Student t-test and Fisher exact test. If available, precontrast CT attenuation of the adrenal adenomas was measured. SII was correlated with attenuation using Pearson correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Mean size of adenomas was smaller than that of metastases (P\u2009<\u20090.002). Mean SII of adenomas (45.0%\u2009\u00b1\u200924.6) was significantly greater than that of metastases (6.6%\u2009\u00b1\u20094.7; P\u2009<\u20090.001). With a threshold of 16.5% for SII, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for adenomas were 80%, 100%, and 89.2%, respectively. All six lipid-rich adenomas were diagnosed as adenomas, and all seven lipid-poor metastases were diagnosed as metastases.",

Patients with low rectal cancer had low anterior resection with stapled straight low colorectal or coloanal anastomosis without proximal diversion. They were prospectively randomized to either oxidized regenerated cellulose reinforcement or no reinforcement. Data collected included age, sex, hemoglobin percentage, albumin level, histopathologic type of the tumor, anastomotic leak, and stricture.

Because perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) have half-lives of years, growth dilution and the development of a new route of excretion (menstruation) could account for some or all of the reported association. OBJECTIVES: To assess how much of the epidemiologic association between PFAS and delayed menarche can be explained by the correlation of growth and maturation with PFAS body burden. METHODS: We developed a Monte Carlo (MC) physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of PFAS to simulate plasma PFAS levels in a hypothetical female population aged 2 to 20years old. Realistic distributions of physiological parameters as well as timing of growth spurts and menarche were incorporated in the model. The association between PFAS level and delayed menarche in the simulated data was compared with the reported association. RESULTS: The prevalence of menarche, distributions of age-dependent physiological parameters, and quartiles of serum PFAS concentrations in the simulated subjects were comparable to those reported in the epidemiologic study. The delay of menarche in days per natural log increase in PFAS concentrations in the simulated data were about one third as large as the observed values.",

Secondary traumatic stress (STS) characterizes those who exhibit PTSD symptoms related to indirect exposure to a stressor. We hypothesized that caring for trauma patients is associated with symptoms of PTSD/STS. METHODS: Surgeons in various specialties (n = 133) were surveyed from January to May 2012 at two regional surgical conferences. Symptoms of PTSD were identified using the Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale (STSS) using specific diagnostic criteria to measure the psychological impact of exposure to trauma patients. Resilience was measured using the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale 10 items. The amount of time caring for trauma patients was used as a measure of risk exposure. The relationship between STSS, resilience, and exposure to trauma patients was measured with p<0.05 considered significant. RESULTS: Twenty-eight surgeons (22%) met diagnostic symptom criteria for PTSD as measured by the STSS. Approximately two thirds of the surgeons (86 of 133, 65%) exhibited at least one symptom of STS. However, the magnitude of exposure to trauma patients was similar between surgeons with and without PTSD symptoms (p = 0.2177). Higher resilience scores were associated with lower STS scores (r = -0.369, p<0.0001).

        "input": "AIMS: To determine the frequency with which the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants are used as add-on therapy to the tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) rather than as replacement therapy. METHODS: The data analysed were profiles of prescription records by date of supply to the patient. From within the national administrative dispensing claims database, the subset eligible for social security entitlements was identified as individuals by means of their coded permanent identification numbers (PINs). Following the initial supply of an SSRI in January 1996, the subsequent 6 months dispensing of SSRI and TCA antidepressants to these individuals was examined. The main outcome measure was the proportion of individuals to whom SSRIs and TCAs were dispensed concurrently, as an indirect measure of coprescription. In instances where a patient was receiving prescriptions for SSRIs and TCAs that had been written by the one doctor only, the major specialty of the doctor was investigated. RESULTS: 55 271 PINs were dispensed 63 865 SSRI prescriptions in January 1996 which represented over half (52%) of the total community SSRI prescriptions dispensed in that month. The number of these patients meeting the criteria for coprescription of SSRIs and TCAs over the next 6 months was 2773 (5%). The coprescribing instances were highest in Queensland and the prescribers most frequently involved had psychiatry major specialty codes.",

Different methods used to stain senile plaques (SPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) might account for this discrepancy. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Here, brains of 11 patients with dementia were examined. Cryosections and paraffin sections from 6 different brain regions (frontal medial, temporal medial and occipital gyrus, hippocampus, superior parietal lobe and cerebellum) of all cases were stained with Bielschowsky, Campbell, Gallyas and Congo red stains each. RESULTS: The study shows that the Bielschowsky silver stain is insufficient for detecting SPs and NFTs, whereas two other methods proved to be more accurate. SPs were found in similar frequency in all brain regions examined (exception: cerebellum). The highest amount was shown with Campbell silver stain in paraffin sections. In Congo red only 25 percent of these SPs were stained, which is probably due to a great number of them not containing any amyloid. NFTs were found almost exclusively in the hippocampus. The highest number was detected with Gallyas silver stain in cryosections.",

Independent work with healthy subjects suggests that one feature of right hemispheric (RH) linguistic processing is a coarse as opposed to a focused semantic activation. We provide a comprehensive review of the literature to these hitherto unrelated fields of research and present an experiment assessing functional hemispheric asymmetries for language processing in healthy volunteers, differing in the susceptibility to schizophrenia-like experiences and thoughts. BACKGROUND: Forty right-handed men were administered a lateralized tachistoscopic lexical decision task. They also completed the Magical Ideation (MI) scale, which examines a variety of paranormal experiences and beliefs. RESULTS: Although the 20 subjects with MI scores below the median displayed the expected right visual field/left hemisphere (RVF/LH) superiority in lexical decision accuracy, the 20 high scorers were equally proficient in both visual fields. Compared to the low scorers, they made significantly more correct decisions in the left visual field/right hemisphere (LVF/RH).",

Our objective was to investigate the impact of being overweight or obese on perioperative and oncologic outcomes after cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion (HIPEC) for peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) from mucinous appendiceal neoplasms (MAN). METHODS: From a prospectively maintained database (2001-2010) of CRS/HIPEC for PC from MAN, we evaluated the body mass index (BMI) of patients, categorizing them into normal weight (NW\u00a0<\u00a025\u00a0kg/m(2)), overweight (OW\u00a0=\u00a025 to 29.9\u00a0kg/m(2)), and obese (OB\u00a0\u2265\u00a030\u00a0kg/m(2)).

However, the surgical results seemed to be worse than could be expected for experienced neurosurgeons in Japan. We therefore analyzed our own surgical results and evaluated them for a comparison with the trial results. METHODS: Data on patients with ruptured, small, anterior circulation aneurysms in good clinical condition (World Federation of Neurological Surgeons grade I or II) and treated with surgical clipping were obtained from various discharge databases for 1997 to 2001, and their outcomes were analyzed in a retrograde fashion. RESULTS: Of the total of 487 patients, 17.6% showed a poor outcome (modified Rankin Scales 3-6) at discharge, and after 1 year, 6.1% remained in poor clinical condition. However, fewer patients were in poor condition both at discharge and after 1 year compared with the surgical and endovascular results for patients entered in the International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial.

Yet, many Level I trauma Centers have raised concerns about the financial drivers influencing transfer. OBJECTIVE: : To study the relationship between insurance status and transfer, we focused on patients with mild head injury to tease apart the medical necessity for transfer from other potential drivers, such as financial factors. METHODS: Using the 2002 to 2006 American College of Surgeons National Trauma Databank and Massachusetts General Hospital's Trauma Databank from 1993 to 2009, we conducted a retrospective study and limited our population to patients with mild head injuries and mild to moderate systemic injuries as determined by the Glasgow Coma Scale, Abbreviated Injury Scale, or Injury Severity Score. Statistical analyses were conducted with STATA software. RESULTS: In a nationalized database, (1) uninsured patients with mild head injury are more likely to be transferred out of a Level II or III facility (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 2.07; P = .000) compared with privately insured patients and (2) uninsured patients are less likely to be accepted by a Level II or III facility for transfer compared with privately insured patients (adjusted OR: = .143; P = .000l). For transfers received by 1 Level I trauma center (Massachusetts General Hospital), uninsured patients are more likely to be transferred to (1) Massachusetts General Hospital between midnight and 6 am (adjusted OR: 5.201; P = .000) compared with other time periods throughout the day and (2) Massachusetts General Hospital on Sunday (adjusted OR: 1.09; P = .000) compared with other days of the week.",

Several risk factors have been identified, but the association between religiousness and a wish to die in older adults has been underexplored, and the association between death attitudes and the presence of a wish to die has not been investigated yet. The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between religiousness and death attitudes on the one hand and wish to die on the other hand, adjusting for clinical factors such as the presence of depression or somatic disorder. METHODS: The sample comprised 113 older inpatients (from a psychiatric and somatic ward) with a mean age of 74 years. Psychiatric diagnoses were assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders, and logistic regression analyses estimated the unique contribution of religiousness and death attitudes to the wish to die, controlling for socio-demographic variables, depressive disorder, and somatic symptoms. RESULTS: Both religiousness and death attitudes were associated with a wish to die in univariate models. Adding these variables in a multivariate logistic hierarchical model, death attitudes remained significant predictors but religiousness did not; 55% of the pseudovariance of the wish to die was explained by these variables, with an effective size of 0.89. Major depressive episode, somatic symptoms, Fear of Death, and Escape Acceptance were the most important predictors of the wish to die.",

With cost containment in mind, the purpose of this performance improvement study was to determine if an increase in hang time of a modular tube feeding product would increase microbial load or affect the nosocomial infection rate in pediatric burn patients. METHODS: This biphasic trial initially evaluated the microbial load of the feeding after delivery of two 4-hour aliquots into a container using the same delivery set (total hang time of 8 hours; number of tests = 20). Second, once this feeding procedure was deemed microbiologically safe, tube feedings were administered to patients, and both microbial load and nosocomial infection rate were monitored for 1 year. RESULTS: Contamination levels at the end of the 8-hour period using the same feeding set with 2 consecutive 4-hour feeding aliquots (number of tests = 38) were lower than standard recommendations. The hospital's nosocomial infection rate was not altered by this procedural change, and feeding-set expenses were reduced.",

METHODS: In our cancer registry database, we identified 93 consecutive patients who underwent resection for oesophageal adenocarcinoma between 1990 and 2004 in two hospitals in our region. Using a predefined histopathological protocol, TSR was determined on the original haematoxylin-eosin (H&E) tissue sections of oesophagectomy specimens by two independent investigators. RESULTS: With a cut-off value of 50% tumour/stroma, patients were classified as TSR high (n=60) or TSR low (n=33). There were no significant differences in patient, tumour and treatment characteristics between the two groups, except for M status (M1a) and radicality of resection. The (disease-free) survival in the TSR high group was significantly better than in the TSR low group.

A continuous effort to improve this decision making process and update the trauma alert criteria is being made. However, criteria for determining the evacuation priority are not well developed. We performed a prospective study to evaluate which pre-hospital parameters identify major trauma victims with an emphasis on a need for emergent surgical procedures. METHODS: A prospective cohort included 601 patients admitted to a level one trauma centre over a three months period. The pre-hospital trauma alert criteria were recorded and set as independent variables. All major surgical procedures were graded in real time as: emergent, urgent, or not urgent. The ISS was calculated after completion of all the diagnostic workup. Patients were classified as major trauma victims if their calculated ISS was 16 or greater, and those needed an urgent intervention or intensive care. The relative risks (RR) for major trauma and a need for an emergent operation were calculated. RESULTS: 243 (40%) patients were classified as having a major trauma. 39 (6.5%) patients required an emergent operative intervention: 24 for an active bleeding, 5 for a pericardial tamponade and 10 for an imminent cerebral herniation. Paramedic judgement and a penetrating injury to the trunk were the most common causes for over triage. However, a penetrating injury to the trunk had been the only clue that the victim needed an emergent operation in five cases. 128 patients had a pre-hospital Glasgow coma score (GCS) \u2264 12. Altered mental status was the most common and a significant predictor of both major trauma (RR of 3.00 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.42-6.32) and a need for an emergent operation (RR of 2.23 with a 95% CI of 1.22-4.02).",

Many studies in Europe and the United States have assessed the association of white matter changes with stroke and other diseases. No similar study has been conducted in sub-Saharan Africa, where risk factors for stroke differ. Our objective was to explore the association between severity of white matter changes (based on visual rating scales) and stroke in a Nigerian population. METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 50 patients were retrospectively assessed and scored using 3 different visual rating scales (by Fazekas et al, Scheltens et al, and Manolio et al). The scores were classified as either mild or severe. Clinical indications and MRI scan results were classified into vascular (stroke) and nonvascular groups. The association between severity of white matter changes and stroke on MRI was explored using the Student t test, the Chi-square test, and multiple regression analysis at an alpha level of .05. RESULTS: White matter changes were consistently and significantly more severe in patients with stroke than in patients without stroke (.01 \u2264 P<.001; odds ratios 4.58 and 13.3, respectively) using the 3 visual rating scales.

Another aspect of the study was to find out whether these substances have any effect on nitric oxide (NO) and free radical production. METHODS: After the induction of colitis with trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid in 64 male rats, physiological saline, honey, prednisolone and disulfiram enemas were applied to the rats once daily for 3 days (acute treatment groups) or 7 days (chronic treatment groups). Control groups received only saline enemas. Rats were killed on the 4th or 8th days and their colonic mucosal damage was quantitated using a scoring system. Acute and chronic inflammatory responses were determined by a mucosal injury score, histological examination and measurement of the myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity of tissues. The content of malonylaldehyde (MDA) and NO metabolites in colon homogenates was also measured to assess the effects of these substances on NO and free oxygen radical production. RESULTS: Estimation of colonic damage by mucosal injury scoring was found to be strongly correlated with the histologic evaluation of colon specimens. On the other hand, mucosal injury scores were not correlated with MPO, MDA or NO values. There were significant differences between the MPO results of chronic-control and chronic-honey groups, as well as chronic-control and chronic-prednisolone groups (p = 0.03 and p = 0.0007).

Newly trained surgeons are often trained only with the placement of pedicle screws within the thoracic and lumbar spine and not with hooks or other means of fixation. However, if the benefits of pedicle screw instrumentation in terms of correction ability cannot be questioned on some issues pertaining to their safety, their rationale for all situations as well as their long-term adverse consequence and or early or late complications start to arise. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We therefore present four case examples that illustrate the advantages, questions and complications inherent to pedicle screw instrumentation in spinal deformities. These four cases serve as discussion supported by a review of the literature. The literature search was performed to include pedicle screws associated risks, costs and complications. Articles focusing on instrumentation of the thoracic and lumbar spine for the treatment of adult and pediatric scoliosis were reviewed. RESULTS: Pedicle screw instrumentation in the treatment of spinal deformity is here to stay, however a fair number of issues have come up since their widespread use that started 10 years ago: these include their misplacement with the inherent risks to the vascular or neurologic structures, the rate of misplaced pedicle screw not per number of screws inserted, but per patient operated, the number of screws really necessary to achieve a satisfactory outcome while maintaining costs, their contraindications in some very challenging deformities where the risks clearly outweigh their advantage compared to hooks. At last, the use of pedicle screw instrumentation has driven many centers in increasing the safety of such procedures using intraoperative spinal cord monitoring as well as improved imaging technologies.",

Postictal suppression index (PSI) is derived from a short time span of electroencephalographic recording at seizure termination, and, alternatively, burst suppression (BS) index is defined as the percentage of suppressed epochs within a predefined time period. METHODS: In a retrospective study including 9 patients with a total of 104 recorded ECT sessions, we compared the influence of variables that are known to alter seizure adequacy like age, stimulation dose, electrode position, and the number of the consecutive ECT sessions on both indices, PSI versus BS index. RESULTS: For PSI, electrode positioning turned out to be a significant independent variable, with bilateral placement revealing higher PSI. Electroconvulsive therapy session number was significant for BS index, with lower burst suppression in higher ECT session number. In contrast to PSI, BS index turned out to be a significant covariate of seizure duration. Postictal suppression index and BS index did not show linear but a significant rank correlation.",

Approximately half of the parents were called 7-10 days after their child's ED visit. The other half were called at least 14 days after the visit and served as the ED-unexposed group. The principal outcome was the onset of a new infection in the week preceding the phone interview, using standardized definitions. Proportions of children with new infections were calculated in both groups and logistic regression was used to adjust for potential confounders. RESULTS: A total of 304 children (mean age 2.4 years) were followed.

STUDY DESIGN: Female volunteers (n = 135; mean age, 69 years) rated the presence and severity (rating, 0-3) of vaginal atrophy symptoms. The presence and severity of vaginal mucosal changes, which included vaginal pH (0-3), were recorded during a pelvic examination. A vaginal cytologic maturation value was performed. Symptoms, signs, pH, and maturation value were correlated by the Spearman rank test. RESULTS: Symptom scores were low (mean, 0.41; range, 0-2.6). Symptoms were only weakly correlated with physical findings (r = 0.14) and not with maturation value (r = 0.06) or age (r = -0.004). There was a moderate correlation between physical examination score and maturation value (r = -0.48). In women>or =65 years old, symptom score and physical examination score were correlated weakly (r = 0.25). Low pH correlated well with high maturation value (r = -0.52).

METHODS: Ninety-six hypercholesterolemic individuals aged 30-65 from three primary care clinics and a worksite clinic received counseling by a physician and/or a dietitian for lifestyle and dietary modifications. Baseline nutritional intake was evaluated using three-day food diaries. Lipoprotein levels were evaluated at six weeks and thereafter every three months for one year. Partial (adjusted) correlations (beta) were calculated between baseline parameters (demographic, anthropometric, nutritional and laboratory) and changes of LDL cholesterol for the short and long term (three and 12 months). RESULTS: The average LDL cholesterol level decreased by 6 +/- 10% (p<0.001) at the end of 12 months. This reduction was positively correlated with baseline LDL cholesterol level (beta = +0.4, p = 0.001), and negatively correlated with the baseline BMI (beta = -0.2, p<0.05) and saturated fat intake (beta = -0.3, p<0.05). The differences between low and high subgroups of baseline LDL cholesterol, BMI and saturated fat intake became apparent only after six to twelve months of therapy and probably result from varying levels of adherence to the dietary regimen. A significant correlation was found between the change in LDL cholesterol after six weeks and the change in LDL cholesterol after 12 months (beta = 0.4, p<0.001).",

Some research indicates that smoking behavior is related to other health behaviors, but little research has examined how smoking may be related to dietary intake of key nutrients, consumption of fast food, sedentary lifestyle, or weight status. The purpose of this study was to describe smoking frequency among adolescents and its relationship to physical activity and dietary patterns. METHODS: The research study employed a cross-sectional, population-based design. Adolescents self-reported cigarette smoking, physical activity, and eating behaviors on the Project EAT (Eating Among Teens) survey and reported dietary intake on a food frequency questionnaire completed in school classrooms. The sample included 4746 middle school and high school students from Minneapolis-St. Paul public schools. Mixed-model regression, which was controlled for sex, race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, grade level (middle school or high school), and school, was used to examine the association of smoking with diet and physical activity patterns. RESULTS: Overall, reported smoking frequency was inversely related to participating in team sports, eating regular meals, and consuming healthful foods and nutrients. Smoking frequency was directly related to frequency of fast-food and soft drink consumption.",

After the images were obtained, 2 different questionnaires were prepared (survey groups A and B) with the photographs without alteration (showing malocclusion) and altered (with orthodontic correction). Subjects appeared in one questionnaire (survey group) with an ideal smile and also in the other (survey group) with a nonideal smile. The images were evaluated by 100 persons responsible for hiring staff for commercial companies. In each survey group, 4 questions were asked regarding the individuals' likelihood of being hired, honesty, intelligence, and efficiency at work. Analysis of variance for repeated measures was used to determine the differences in the evaluations of patients with ideal and nonideal dental esthetics for the 4 characteristics evaluated. The level of significance adopted was 5%. RESULTS: The photographs of persons with ideal dental esthetics were, on average, evaluated as superior with respect to intelligence and likelihood of being hired than were the photographs of the same subjects with nonideal dental esthetics.

DESIGN: A matched cross sectional study. SETTING: The Department of Gynaecological Oncology, The Samaritan Hospital, London; the Department of Genitourinary Medicine, St Mary's Hospital, London; and the Family Planning Clinic, Claremont Terrace, Glasgow. SUBJECTS: Fifty HIV seropositive women enrolled from the Genitourinary Medicine Department and the Drug Dependency Unit at St Mary's Hospital, London, and the Unit of Infectious Diseases at Ruchill Hospital, Glasgow. Forty-three HIV seronegative controls enrolled from the Department of Genitourinary Medicine at St Mary's Hospital, matched against 43 of the seropositive women for age, age at first intercourse, lifetime number of sexual partners, and smoking habit. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Associations between CIN, as detected by cytology and histology, and HIV infection. Association was also sought between CIN and immunosuppression, as measured clinically by T4 cell number, beta-2-microglobulin and p24 antigen. Associations of these with: (1) HPV, as detected by Southern blot testing and the polymerase chain reaction; (2) EBV, as detected by Southern blot testing; and (3) HSV, as detected by tissue culture of endocervical swabs, was also studied. RESULTS: HIV infection was associated with a significantly increased prevalence of CIN (22% vs 11%, p = 0.02). This was not due to increased immunosuppression, as measured by T4 cell count, beta-2-microglobulin or p24 antigen. HPV was detected in 25% of HIV seropositive women and 11% of HIV seronegative women (p = 0.001). EBV was detected in 11% of HIV seropositive women and 14% of HIV seronegative women (p = 0.2).

We propose that surgical excision followed by vaccination with an autogenous condyloma acuminata vaccine is the most effective therapy available in primary and recurrent perianal condyloma acuminata. METHODS: Eighty-three patients with perianal condyloma acuminata were treated from 1985 to 1992. Treatment was divided for patients as follows: surgical excision, 20; bichloroacetic acid, 10; podophyllin and interferon A, 5; excision followed by autogenous condyloma acuminata vaccination twice weekly using 0.1 ml subcutaneously for three weeks increasing to 1.0 ml subcutaneously for seven weeks, 43. Syphilis was diagnosed in seven patients; two were human immunovirus-positive. All but three patients were male. Of those patients treated with the vaccination protocol, 25 had primary and 18 had recurrent disease. RESULTS: Recurrence rates were: excision alone and bichloroacetic acid, 50 percent; podophyllin and interferon A, 85 percent; whereas only 4.6 percent recurred when treated with excision and vaccination.

METHODS: The study involved 2764 general practitioners (GPs) and 316 specialists who enrolled a total of 25,589 patients with OA of the hand, knee, and hip. RESULTS: Pharmacological treatment alone was prescribed to 55% of the patients seen by GPs, 25% of those seen by rheumatologists, 8% of those seen by orthopedic surgeons, and 17% of those seen by physical medicine specialists (GPs versus specialists, P<0.001). Specialists often prescribed a combined pharmacological and nonpharmacological approach (rheumatologists 51%, orthopedic surgeons 66%, physical medicine specialists 76%). Concomitant comorbidities and their treatment do not seem to influence OA prescription modalities except for peptic ulcer and anticoagulant therapy.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether C pneumoniae infection is associated with stroke and cerebrovascular disease, including transient ischemic attacks and abnormal transcranial Doppler examinations, in children with SCD. METHODS: Children with SCD on chronic transfusion due to a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, or abnormal transcranial Doppler; children with SCD without stroke; healthy controls; and children being transfused for other reasons were enrolled. Peripheral blood and nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens were collected from all patients. In patients on transfusion, pretransfusion specimens and samples from the unit of packed red blood cells being transfused were obtained. Peripheral blood monocytic cells (PBMCs) and NP swab specimens were cultured for C pneumoniae in HEp-2 cells. C pneumoniae polymerase chain reaction was performed on PBMCs with a nested touch-down method with primers from the omp-1gene (in duplicate) and a second real-time polymerase chain reaction by using 16S ribosomal RNA primers.

Specific objectives included the following: (1) to compare the physician's predicted performance on functional assessment with actual performance, and (2) to compare the physician's predicted effort during functional assessment with an objective measure of effort. DESIGN: A total of 201 outpatients with chronic pain completed this prospective, multicenter, cohort study. Fifteen physicians, who were trained to administer the standardized evaluation, performed the evaluations and predicted performance and effort on functional assessment. Therapists, blinded to the physician's evaluation, administered a functional assessment (maximal and sustained lifts [n = 3 types]; repetitive activities [n = 4 types]) and a grip dynamometry test (effort measure) on each subject. RESULTS: Pearson's correlation testing demonstrated significant correlations between the physician's predicted performance and the observed performance for all lifting items and repetitive activities in both men (0.52, 0.50, 0.55) and women (0.36, 0.40, 0.18).

METHODS: We used echocardiographically defined fractional area of contraction (FAC), and LV area to end-systolic arterial pressure estimates of end-systolic elastance (E'es) and its change in response to dobutamine (5 microg/kg/min) in 10 subjects in septic shock admitted to an intensive care unit of an academic medical center. Subjects were studied on admission and again at both 5 days and 8-10 days after admission. RESULTS: Three of the 10 subjects died as a result of their acute process, while the others were discharged from hospital. Nine out of 10 subjects required intravenous vasopressor therapy on day 1, while only 1 of 9 subjects required vasopressor support at day 5.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the relationship between types of traffic, traffic volume, and distance and wheezing among infants less than 1 year of age. METHODS: A geographic information system and a classification scheme were developed to categorize infants enrolled in the study as living near moving truck and bus traffic (highway>50 miles per hour,>1000 trucks daily,<400 m), stop-and-go truck and bus traffic (<50 miles per hour,<100 m), or unexposed and not residing near either. Symptom data were based on health questionnaires administered to parents when the infants were 6 months of age and monthly health diaries. RESULTS: Infants living very near (<100 m) stop-and-go bus and truck traffic had a significantly increased prevalence of wheezing (adjusted odds ratio, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.15-5.42) when compared with unexposed infants. The prevalence of wheezing among nonwhite infants was at least twice that of white infants, regardless of exposure. Infants living less than 400 m from a high volume of moving traffic, however, did not have an increased prevalence of wheezing.",

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine the effectiveness of cervical collars and cervicothoracic orthoses for stabilizing clinically relevant, experimentally produced cervical spine injuries. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Most previous in vitro studies of cervical orthoses used a simplified injury model with all ligaments transected at a single spinal level, which differs from real-life neck injuries. Human volunteer studies are limited to measuring only sagittal motions or 3-dimensional motions only of the head or 1 or 2 spinal levels. METHODS: Three-plane flexibility tests were performed to evaluate 2 cervical collars (Vista Collar and Vista Multipost Collar) and 2 cervicothoracic orthoses (Vista TS and Vista TS4) using a skull-neck-thorax model with 8 injured cervical spine specimens (manufacturer of orthoses: Aspen Medical Products Inc, Irvine, CA). The injuries consisted of flexion-compression at the lower cervical spine and extension-compression at superior spinal levels. Pair-wise repeated measures analysis of variance (P<0.05) and Bonferroni post hoc tests determined significant differences in average range of motions of the head relative to the base, C7 or T1, among experimental conditions. RESULTS.: All orthoses significantly reduced unrestricted head/base flexion and extension. The orthoses allowed between 8.4% and 25.8% of unrestricted head/base motion in flexion/extension, 57.8% to 75.5% in axial rotation, and 53.8% to 73.7% in lateral bending. The average percentages of unrestricted motion allowed by the collars were 12.2% to 21.2% in flexion/extension, 42.2% to 52.2% in axial rotation, and 32.2% to 42.2% in lateral bending.",

Recent studies have suggested that obesity may serve as a prognostic indicator of poor outcome in non-ERCP-induced acute pancreatitis. However, to our knowledge, no one has ever investigated the potential association of obesity and ERCP-induced pancreatitis. Thus, the purpose of our study was to determine whether obesity conferred an increased risk and/or more severe course of post-ERCP pancreatitis. METHODS: A 160 variable database was prospectively collected by a defined protocol on patients undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic ERCP at 15 centers in the Midwest Pancreaticobiliary Group and participating in a randomized controlled study, evaluating whether prophylactic corticosteroids reduces the incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis. Body mass indices (BMIs) were available on 964 of the 1115 patients from the original study. A BMI>or = 30 kg/m2 was defined as obese (World Health Organization) and used as a cutoff point in this study. BMIs were analyzed in a retrospective fashion to determine whether obesity confers an increased risk and/or more severe course of post-ERCP pancreatitis. Data were collected before the ERCP, at the time of procedure, and 24 to 72 hours after discharge. Standardized criteria were used to diagnose and grade the severity of postprocedure pancreatitis. RESULTS: Nine hundred sixty four patients were enrolled in the study. Pancreatitis occurred in 149 patients (15.5%) and was graded as mild in 101 (67.8%), moderate in 42 (28.2%), and severe in 6 (4.0%). The incidence of pancreatitis was not significantly different between obese and non-obese patients (15.5% vs. 15.1%, p = 0.99). However, the severity of pancreatitis was significantly higher in obese patients (67.8% vs. 54.4%, p = 0.001).",

Vasculitides were confirmed on thoracic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT). Patients completed a standardized questionnaire incorporating the Berlin criteria to assess inflammatory back pain. Existing scans were reassessed for sacroiliitis and ferritin antibodies measured in all patients. RESULTS: Fifteen patients exhibiting new LVV were identified. Diagnosis was confirmed using MRI in nine patients and FDG-PET/CT in six. Six patients (40%) fulfilled American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for giant cell arteritis (GCA) and polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), and nine PMR only. Four patients fulfilled the Berlin criteria for inflammatory back pain, with three demonstrating sacroiliitis on imaging. All remaining patients demonstrated no sacroiliitis.

However, the clinical difficulty in using this approach lies in determining which type II SCHFs can be managed successfully without a surgical intervention. METHODS: We reviewed clinical and radiographic information on 259 pediatric type II SCHFs that were enrolled in a prospective registry of elbow fractures. The characteristics of the patients who were treated without surgery were compared with those of patients who were treated surgically. Treatment outcomes, as assessed by the final clinical and radiographic alignment, range of motion of the elbow, and complications, were compared between the groups to define clinical and radiographic features that related to success or failure of nonoperative management. RESULTS: During the course of treatment, 39 fractures were found to have unsatisfactory alignment with nonoperative management and were taken for surgery. Ultimately, 150 fractures (57.9%) were treated nonoperatively, and 109 fractures (42.1%) were treated surgically. At final follow-up, outcome measures of change in carrying angle, range of motion, and complications did not show clinically significant differences between treatment groups.

The aim of the study was to assess the cardiac changes secondary to CAP by echocardiography and to find out the correlation between echocardiographic findings and the severity of CAP. METHODS: A total of 111 unselected consecutive adult patients hospitalized with CAP were enrolled. The control group consisted of 100 consecutive sex- and age-matched patients. The severity of CAP was evaluated with the pneumonia severity index and the CURB-65 (confusion, urea, respiratory rate, arterial blood pressure and age) score. Blood samples were taken and echocardiography was performed within the first 48 hours. RESULTS: White blood count, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and red blood cell distribution width were significantly higher in the CAP group compared with the control group. The 2 groups did not differ in terms of left and right ventricle ejection fraction, left atrial diameter, pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameter. However, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (21.1 \u00b1 4.3 vs 22.3 \u00b1 4.1 mm; P = .04), aortic distensibility (2.5 \u00b1 0.9 vs 3.5 \u00b1 0.9 cm(2):dyne:10, P<.001), and aortic strain (5.8% \u00b1 2% vs 6.5% \u00b1 1.9%, P = .009) were significantly reduced in CAP group than in controls.

METHODS: MRI and histological examinations were conducted in 28 Wistar rats with sterotactically implanted gliomas (C6 gliomas). Of the 28 animals, 14 were examined after intravenous administration of MION [nine animals received 179 mmol Fe/kg body weight (dose 1), and five, 893 mmol Fe/kg (dose 2)]. The other 14 animals were examined first after i.v. administration of Gd-DTPA (0.2 mmol/kg) and then after i.v. administration of MION. The extent of the tumors as seen on MRI and at histological study were compared. RESULTS: Iron particles were identified microscopically in tumor cells and in the tumoral interstitium. After administration of MION at dose 1, the contrast-enhanced area of tumor was 1.55-fold greater than the extent of tumor identified by histological study, at dose 2,2.15-fold.

It may be asked whether juvenile offenders can be treated as one homogeneous group, or, if they are divisible into subgroups, whether different risk factors are predictive of recidivism. AIMS AND HYPOTHESES: Our aims were to find out whether serious juvenile offenders may be subdivided into clearly defined subgroups and whether such subgroups might differ in terms of the risk factors that predict recidivism. METHODS: In a sample of 1111 serious juvenile offenders, latent class analysis was used to identify subgroups. For each juvenile offender, 70 risk factors were registered. Severity of recidivism was measured on a 12-point scale. Analysis was then conducted to identify the risk factors that best predicted the different patterns of recidivism. RESULTS: Four distinct subgroups of juvenile offenders were identified: serious violent offenders, violent property offenders, property offenders, and sex offenders. Violent property offenders were the most serious recidivists and had the highest number of risk factors. Serious violent offenders and property offenders were characterised by overt and covert behaviour, respectively. Sex offenders differed from the other three groups in the rarity of their recidivism and in the risk factors that are present. For each of these four subgroups, a different set of risk factors was found to predict severity of recidivism.",

This study aimed to determine whether an instruction video or palpation aid improved the effectiveness of BSE. METHODS: A total of 100 volunteers (50 men and 50 women) with no previous experience of BSE and/or clinical breast palpation were randomly assigned to the following intervention: instruction video seen versus not seen and use of palpation aids versus aids not used. Participants completed psychological trait and previous knowledge questionnaires before the intervention and/or breast examination. Examination was carried out on 24 different sized silicone breast forms, into 20 of which had been inserted tumor equivalents measuring 0.8-3.0 cm in diameter. The dependent variable was the rate of accurate tumor detection--the mean sum of correct positive hits (CPH)--defined as tumors detected within 20 s. Mean CPH values were then analyzed in relation to the interventions and other variables including gender and psychological measures (ANOVA and COVAR). RESULTS: Neither the instruction video nor interaction effects between gender and the instruction video influenced the mean CPH value. Furthermore, the palpation aid was strongly and significantly associated with a reduced detection (p=0.00003).",

The Hancock II bioprosthesis has been reported to have excellent durability in patients \u2265 60 years of age. This study examines the long-term durability of the Hancock II bioprosthesis in the aortic position in patients<60 years of age. METHODS: From 1982 to 2008, 304 patients aged 59 years or less underwent aortic valve replacement (AVR) with a Hancock II bioprosthesis at two centres. The mean age was 49.2 \u00b1 9.0 years, and 79% of the patients were male. Valve function was serially assessed by echocardiography. The median follow-up was 14.6 years (maximum 27.5 years). Survival and freedom from adverse events were calculated by using a Kaplan-Meier method. Independent predictors of those events were assessed by using Cox proportional hazards analyses. RESULTS: Survival and freedom from repeat AVR (re-AVR) at 20 years were 57.0 \u00b1 6.1 and 25.4 \u00b1 4.7%, respectively. During the follow-up, 100 patients (33%) underwent re-AVR: 78 for structural valve deterioration (SVD), 11 for endocarditis, 4 for non-structural valve dysfunction and 7 for other reasons.

However, few studies have addressed this issue specifically. In this study, we investigated whether EPBD can preserve sphincter function, and evaluated whether or not such preservation has clinical significance. METHODS: Seventy patients with common bile duct (CBD) stones were randomly assigned to EPBD or endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST). Sphincter of Oddi (SO) function was measured by endoscopic manometry before, one week after, and one year after treatment. Incidence of pneumobilia and later complications were compared between the two groups at one year. Series manometric data were compared within each group and between the two groups. For a more detailed analysis of the cumulative incidence of later complications, retrospective cohorts were added to the study groups, giving a total number of 235 patients in the EPBD group and 126 in the EST group. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between the 35 EPBD and 35 EST patients. CBD stones were discharged successfully in all cases. CBD pressure, SO basal and peak pressures, and contraction frequency decreased significantly at one week in both groups. The damage was more severe in the EST group, and SO contraction completely disappeared in 23 patients in this group. The incidence of pneumobilia was significantly lower in the EPBD group than in the EST group (p<0.01) whereas CBD stones recurred and cholecystitis appeared at a similar rate in both groups at one year. A complete series of manometric data up to one year was obtained in 55 patients; 28 in the post-EPBD and 27 in post-EST groups.

RESULTS: In patients with localized RCC (N0M0), the risk of recurrence after nephrectomy was significantly increased in patients with venous thrombus compared to patients without venous thrombus (p = 0.005). However, the difference was not significant in a multivariate analysis including T stage (1, 2, 3 or 4), Fuhrman grade and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status. In patients with localized RCC disease specific survival was similar (p = 0.536) in patients with RV (T3b) and IVC involvement below the diaphragm (T3b). However, patients with IVC involvement above the diaphragm (T3c) had a significantly worse survival rate even after controlling for Fuhrman grade and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status in a multivariate analysis (p = 0.020).

These enzymes catalyse the oxidative biotransformation of about 25% of clinically important drugs as well as the metabolism of numerous environmental chemical carcinogens. The most frequent null allele of CYP2D6 in European populations, CYP2D6*4, has been studied here in order to elucidate whether a relationship exists between this allele and the risk of developing breast cancer in a Spanish population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-six breast cancer Spanish patients and one hundred healthy female volunteers were genotyped for the CYP2D6*4 allele using AmpliChip CYP450 Test technology. RESULTS: Homozygous CYP2D6*4 frequency was significant lower in breast cancer patients than in the control group (OR=0.22, p=0.04). The heterozygous CYP2D6*4 group also displayed lower values in patients than in controls but the difference was not significant (OR=0.698, p=0.28). Therefore, the presence of the CYP2D6*4 allele seems to decrease susceptibility to breast carcinoma in the selected population.",

METHODS: Qualitative focus group and individual interviews with seven immigrant GPs, five men and two women, age 36-65 years. Their clinical experience in Norwegian primary health care ranged from four to 30 years. Analysis was conducted by systematic text condensation. RESULTS: First, immigrant GPs described a gradual process of becoming bicultural: the GPs communicate with immigrant patients on their own terms and draw upon their special knowledge from abroad to help selected patients, while also adapting to Norwegian cultural expectations of the GP's role. Second, the GPs described being aware of cultural issues in consultations with immigrant and Norwegian patients, but rarely making these issues explicit. The GPs ventured that cultural awareness, together with their personal experience in their own countries and as immigrants in Norway, made them able to sometimes help immigrant patients better than Norwegian GPs. Third, immigrant GPs experienced a big workload related to immigrant patients, but they accepted this as a natural part of their work. Fourth, immigrant GPs felt that they had to work harder and be more careful than their Norwegian colleagues in order to avoid complaints from patients, and to be accepted by colleagues.",

Interpretation of this incongruence as ambivalence overlooks the possibility that happiness about the prospect of pregnancy and desire to prevent pregnancy need not be mutually exclusive. METHODS: Data from the 2006-2008 Border Contraceptive Access Study--a prospective study of 956 Latina oral contraceptive users aged 18-44 in El Paso, Texas--were used to compare women's planned pill use and childbearing intentions with their feelings about a possible pregnancy. Associations between women's feelings and their perceptions of their partner's feelings were examined using logistic regression. Prospective and retrospective intentions and feelings were compared among women who became pregnant during the study. RESULTS: Forty-one percent of women who planned to use the pill for at least another year and 34% of those who wanted no more children said they would feel very or somewhat happy about becoming pregnant in the next three months. Perceiving that a male partner would feel very upset about a pregnancy was negatively associated with happiness about the pregnancy among both women who planned to continue pill use and those who wanted no more children (coefficients, -4.4 and -3.9, respectively).

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether use of renal grafts with multiple arteries affects long-term graft survival and function. METHODS: The outcomes of 259 consecutive kidney transplants between 1996 and 2000 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into 2 groups, multiple renal artery graft recipients (n = 70) and single renal artery graft recipients (n = 189). Short-term complications and long-term outcomes (survival rates, blood pressure after transplant, creatinine clearance, and proteinuria levels at 1, 3, 5, and 7 years after transplant) were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Early vascular complications were more common (P = .02) in multiple artery graft recipients (18.6%) than in single artery graft recipients (7.9%), mainly because of occlusion of a polar artery in grafts with multiple renal arteries (7.1%). Urologic complications were no more frequent in one group than in the other (5.7% vs 5.3%; P = .89).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tissue from BPH in TZ and PZ was obtained from 68 patients undergoing transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsy and used for both morphometric analysis and immunohistochemical studies. The epithelial, stromal and luminal composition of the tissue was determined using a computer-assisted method for quantitative morphometric analysis. Apoptosis was detected as the apoptotic index (AI) using the TdT dUTP nick-end labelling assay. Cell proliferation was determined as the proliferation index (PI) using Ki-67 immunostaining.

RESULTS: When full, extracellular water (ECW) and the ratio of ECW to total body water (TBW) were greater compared with when empty: 13.9 \u00b1 3.0l versus 13.4 \u00b1 3.0, and 0.393 \u00b1 0.01 versus 0.391 \u00b1 0.01, P<0.001, respectively. Segmental ECW/TBW was only different for the trunk, 0.395 \u00b1 0.01 full versus 0.392 \u00b1 0.01 empty, P<0.0001. Body composition changed with a fall in skeletal muscle mass from 26.1 \u00b1 6.3 to 25.2 \u00b1 6.1 kg, P<0.001, and a smaller reduction in body fat from 19.3 \u00b1 8.4 to 19.1 \u00b1 8.0 kg, P=0.0104.",

The objective of this study is to assess, at discharge, patients' comprehension of their ED care and instructions and their awareness of deficiencies in their comprehension. METHODS: We conducted structured interviews of 140 adult English-speaking patients or their primary caregivers after ED discharge in 2 health systems. Participants rated their subjective understanding of 4 domains: (1) diagnosis and cause; (2) ED care; (3) post-ED care, and (4) return instructions. We assessed patient comprehension as the degree of agreement (concordance) between patients' recall of each of these domains and information obtained from chart review. Two authors scored each case independently and discussed discrepancies before providing a final concordance rating (no concordance, minimal concordance, partial concordance, near concordance, complete concordance). RESULTS: Seventy-eight percent of patients demonstrated deficient comprehension (less than complete concordance) in at least 1 domain; 51% of patients, in 2 or more domains. Greater than a third of these deficiencies (34%) involved patients' understanding of post-ED care, whereas only 15% were for diagnosis and cause.

METHODS: We analyzed a retrospective cohort of patients with negative preoperative testing for SUI who underwent SCP from 2005 to 2012. Our primary outcome was new onset postoperative SUI. Logistic regression was used to examine the relationship among anatomical change, defined as \u0394Aa, \u0394Ba, \u0394C, and \u0394TVL, and surgical approach, categorized as abdominal (ASCP) for open cases and minimally invasive (MISCP) for laparoscopic and robot-assisted cases, and postoperative SUI. RESULTS: Of 795 cases, 33 ASCP (43%) and 44 MISCP (57%) met the inclusion criteria for analysis. New onset SUI was demonstrated by 15 patients (45%) of the ASCP group and 7 patients (15%) of the MISCP group (p\u2009=\u20090.005).

METHODS: From January 1, 1999, to December 1, 2002, a total of 371 patients were identified as having a preoperative creatinine concentration greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL. This number included 291 patients who did not need hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis to support renal function. These patients were subdivided into those undergoing traditional CABG with CPB (103 patients) and those undergoing off-pump revascularization (188 patients) whose demographic, operative, and outcome information was retrospectively reviewed and compared. RESULTS: The off-pump cohort was older than the on-pump cohort (70 +/- 9.6 versus 66 +/- 10.9 years; P =.002), had a lower prevalence of previous myocardial infarction (35% versus 50%; P =.008), and had a modestly higher mean left ventricular ejection fraction (0.47 +/- 0.01 versus 0.43 +/- 0.01; P =.017).

        "input": "UNLABELLED: In a prospective cohort study of 5,995 older American men (MrOS), users of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors had a small but significant increase in bone loss at the hip over 4\u00a0years after adjustment for confounders. Use of angiotensin II AT1 receptor blockers (ARB) was not significantly associated with bone loss. INTRODUCTION: Experimental evidence suggests that angiotensin II promotes bone loss by its effects on osteoblasts. It is therefore plausible that ACE inhibitor and ARB may reduce rates of bone loss. The objective of this study is to examine the independent effects of ACE inhibitor and ARB on bone loss in older men. METHODS: Out of 5,995 American men (87.2%) aged \u226565\u00a0years, 5,229 were followed up for an average of 4.6\u00a0years in a prospective six-center cohort study-The Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS). Bone mineral densities (BMD) at total hip, femoral neck, and trochanter were measured by Hologic densitometer (QDR 4500) at baseline and year\u00a04. RESULTS: Out of 3,494 eligible subjects with complete data, 1,166 and 433 subjects reported use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, respectively. When compared with nonusers, continuous use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a small (0.004\u00a0g/cm(2)) but significant increase in the average rate of BMD loss at total hip and trochanter over 4\u00a0years after adjustment for confounders. Use of ARB was not significantly associated with bone loss.",

The optimal treatment of descending aortic dissection in these patients is a major challenge. We investigated the feasibility and outcomes of endovascular repair of the descending aorta in patients already submitted to open aortic root/arch surgery. METHODS: From March 1998 to July 2008, 12 patients (10 male and 2 female patients; mean age, 37.8 +/- 11.6 years) affected by Marfan syndrome underwent endovascular treatment for dissection of the descending aorta after previous open aortic root/arch surgery. Stent graft procedures were performed urgently in 5 patients and electively in 7 patients. RESULTS: Neither in-hospital deaths nor perioperative paraplegia or stroke occurred. Follow-up (median, 31 months; range, 3-57 months) was 100% complete. One patient needed surgical conversion for persistent type I endoleak, leading to false lumen expansion 3 months after endovascular repair.

This study examined whether attributes of mental healthcare professionals (professional training, clinical experience, socio-demographic variables) affect their implicit weighing of symptoms they encounter in such unstandardized diagnostic situations. METHODS: Twenty psychiatrists and 28 clinical psychologists rated the relevance of 241 items for the diagnosis of a depressive episode. Items referred to the nine A-criteria of DSM-IV and associated features. Intraclass correlations (ICC), regression analysis and t-tests were calculated. RESULTS: Clinicians agreed largely in their relevance judgements on the different items ( ICC = 0.97, F (183,8784) = 44.29, p<0.001). Stepwise regression analyses with profession, clinical experience, age and gender as predictors for each DSM-IV A-criterion revealed no significant \u03b2-coefficient except for one: 'profession' was a significant predictor for the mean relevance judgement on items that could not be assigned to an A-criterion.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether patients with depressed left ventricular ejection fraction following acute myocardial infarction have a similar reduction in mortality from ACE inhibitors regardless of their renal function. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using medical record data. SETTING: All nonfederal acute care hospitals. PATIENTS: A cohort of 20,902 Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older directly admitted to the hospital from February 1, 1994, through July 30, 1995, and with a documented left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 40% measured by echocardiography, radionuclide scintigraphy, or angiography following a confirmed acute myocardial infarction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: One-year survival for patients who received or who did not receive an ACE inhibitor at hospital discharge, stratified by the patient's level of renal function. RESULTS: For the entire cohort, the receipt of an ACE inhibitor on hospital discharge was associated with greater 1-year survival (hazards ratio, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-0.91) after adjusting for patient demographic characteristics, comorbidity, severity of illness (including left ventricular ejection fraction), and the receipt of other therapies. In stratified models, the receipt of an ACE inhibitor was associated with a 37% (16%-52%) lower mortality for patients who had poor renal function (creatinine clearance, less than 30 mL/min per 1.73 m2) compared with those who had normal renal function (creatinine clearance, greater than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2).",

The aim of our study is to assess the incidence of parametrial involvement in patients who underwent radical parametrectomy for occult cervical cancer or radical hysterectomy for early-stage cervical cancer and to suggest an algorithm for the triage of patients with occult cervical cancer to avoid RP. METHODS: A total of 13 patients with occult cervical cancer who had undergone RP with an upper vaginectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy were included in this retrospective study. Data on the clinicopathologic characteristics of the cases were collected. The published literature was also reviewed, and low risk factors for parametrial involvement in early-stage cervical cancer were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 13 patients, 9 had a stage IB1 lesion, and 4 had a stage IA2 lesion. There were four patients with grade 1 disease, seven with grade 2 disease, and two with grade 3 disease. The median age of the entire patients was 41 years. The most common indication for extrafascial hysterectomy was cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3.

Many topical agents have been used in combination with narrowband UVB therapy to increase its efficacy in causing repigmentation in vitiligo. Placental extract is used topically usually in combination with sun exposure to cause repigmentation of vitiligo lesions. AIMS: The present study aims to study whether the efficacy of narrowband UVB therapy would be enhanced by addition of topical placental extract to the treatment regimen. METHODS: Ninety patients with vitiligo having more or less bilaterally symmetrical lesions on the face, trunk or limbs and receiving narrowband UVB therapy were enrolled for the study and instructed to apply topical placental extract (placentrex) lotion on their vitiligo lesions on the right side of the body. The other side of the body received narrowband UVB therapy alone and served as the control side. The extent of repigmentation achieved was assessed by VASI scoring and compared between the symmetrical lesions present on the two sides at monthly intervals and at the end of study period. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients with 218 symmetrically distributed lesions, excluding those present on the hands or feet, were evaluated for study results at the end of treatment period. The time to onset of repigmentation as well as the mean NB-UVB dosage required was the same on the two sides.

OBJECTIVES: To delineate the best factors determining final lumbar curve magnitude in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis undergoing a selective thoracic anterior or posterior spinal fusion at or proximal to the first lumbar vertebra. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Although spontaneous lumbar curve correction occurs consistently following a selective thoracic anterior or posterior spinal fusion, the degree of correction is somewhat unpredictable. METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients with major thoracic-compensatory lumbar adolescent idiopathic scoliosis treated by a single surgeon with either selective posterior spinal fusion (n = 44) or anterior spinal fusion (n = 56) of the main thoracic region with an unfused lumbar spine with a lumbar B modifier (lumbar apex touching the center sacral vertical line) or lumbar C modifier (lumbar apex completely lateral to the center sacral vertical line) were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Those patients who maintained excellent postoperative coronal balance, with spontaneous lumbar curve correction, had their thoracic Cobb corrected intraoperatively to a measurement very close to but not more than that of the preoperative thoracic push-prone Cobb. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was used to develop a formula to help predict lumbar response in those patients undergoing selective thoracic fusion. This is represented in the following formula: Final lumbar Cobb = 14.4 + 3.06 (lumbar modifier; 0 = B, 1 = C) + 0.30 (preoperative standing lumbar Cobb) + 0.24 (preoperative thoracic Cobb).",

        "input": "AIMS: Recently, early detection of liver tumors has been possible with improvement of various imaging techniques, and practical selection of imaging is clinically necessary to distinguish metastatic liver carcinoma (MLC) from colorectal carcinoma. METHODOLOGY: We retrospectively examined the diagnostic accuracy of enhanced computed tomography (eCT) and super paramagnetic iron oxide particles magnetic resonance imaging (SPIO-MRI) for 110 MLC lesions in 47 patients who underwent hepatic resection at a single Japanese cancer institute between 2000 and 2006. Sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of both imaging techniques in comparison with resected specimens were analyzed. Fourteen cases were synchronous liver metastasis, which were resected simultaneously. RESULTS: On a per patient basis, both eCT and SPIO-MRI showed a sensitivity of 85.1% (40 of 47 patients) and PPV was 100%, respectively. On a per lesion basis, a sensitivity of SPIO-MRI (98/110 lesions; 89%) tended to be higher than that of eCT (92 of 110 lesions; 84%), but not statistically different (p=0.32). PPV of SPIO-MRI (98 of 99 lesions; 99%) was not different from that of eCT (92 of 93; 99%). Twelve lesions in 7 patients that were not detected by both imaging methods were small lesions. PPV for liver cyst and non-timorous lesions was 99% by both imaging methods. Two liver cysts were not detected by eCT.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Selecting a lower tube current for CT fluoroscopic spine injections is a method of radiation dose reduction. Ideally tube current should be tailored to the patient's body habitus, but a greater influence on tube current may be the proceduralist's personal preference. The purpose of this study was to compare tube current and fluoroscopy time of different proceduralists for lumbar spine CT-guided selective nerve root blocks, and to correlate image quality to patient diameter and tube current. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty CT-guided SNRBs performed by 4 proceduralists were retrospectively reviewed for tube current and fluoroscopy time. Patient body habitus was evaluated by measuring anteroposterior diameters on scout images. Image quality was evaluated objectively and subjectively: noise was measured in the psoas muscle and images were graded on a 3-point scale. RESULTS: The mean tube current was 59 \u00b1 20 mA and mean fluoroscopy time was 10.4 \u00b1 7.5 seconds. The mean tube current between proceduralists differed by almost 2-fold, and there was greater than 2-fold difference in mean fluoroscopy time (P<.0001 and .01, respectively). Mean AP body size was 27 \u00b1 5 cm. When categoric data of tube current and AP diameter were analyzed, only AP diameter was a statistically significant variable influencing image noise (P = .009). Twenty of 23 patients with AP diameter \u226430 cm had adequate to excellent image quality, even with lower tube current of \u226440 mA.",

'Kidskin' was a non-randomized, school-based sun protection intervention trial in Perth, Western Australia (1995-1999). Its aim was to determine the extent to which such a program could reduce children's sun exposure. METHODS: Kidskin involved 1614 children assigned to one of three groups: a Control, a 'Moderate' and a 'High' intervention group of 14, 11 and 8 schools respectively. The unit of assignment was the school. Control schools received the standard health education curriculum, while intervention schools received a multi-component intervention including a specially designed curriculum. The High intervention group received additional components. Outcomes included parent reported sun-related behaviors and objectively measured suntan at the end of summer vacation. These outcomes were observed every 2 years. Statistical analyses allowed for correlations between students within schools. RESULTS: Kidskin initially had favorable effects on reported sun exposure and measured suntan. However, at the end of the 4-year program, and again 2 years later, little evidence of a favorable effect remained.",

        "input": "INTRODUCTION: In 2012 the incidence rate of tuberculosis in Poland was 19.6/100,000 but these was great variability between regions concerning notification rates (from 10.9/100,000 to 30.2/100,000). The aim of the study was to assess whether there are elements that might confirm that these differences are true. To answer this question, we compared the population of TB patients from regions with higher notification rates to the population of patients from regions with lower notifications rates. The data collected during three consecutive years were analysed. We selected for comparison the regions with the lowest and highest notification rates and those in which the notification rates for 3 years (2010-2012) were relatively stable. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eight regions were chosen: three regions (Group I) with high notification rates (from 23.7 to 32.3/100,000 - mean rates in the analysed period of time) and five (Group II) with low notification rates (mean rates from 12.2 to 18.6/100,000). RESULTS: It was found that the proportion of sputum culture-positive patients was significantly higher in Group II. Thus, the difference in the notification rate of cases with culture-confirmed tuberculosis was smaller than the difference in the whole notification rate. Nevertheless, it was still significant. Tubercle bacilli in patients from Group I were significantly more often resistant to one drug. The incidence of chronic fibro-cavernous disease and of tuberculous pneumonia was significantly higher in Group I. The proportion of patients with symptoms was higher in Group I than in Group II. In addition, patients in Group I had the so-called primary tuberculosis (tuberculosis in the first year of the disease) more often.",

When delivered as email alerts, synopses enable clinicians to become aware of new developments relevant for practice. Once read, a synopsis can become a known item of clinical information. In time-pressured situations, remembering a known item may facilitate information retrieval by the clinician. However, exactly how synopses first delivered as email alerts influence retrieval at some later time is not known. OBJECTIVES: We examined searches for clinical information in which a synopsis previously read as an email alert was retrieved (defined as a dyad). Our study objectives were to (1) examine whether family physicians retrieved synopses they previously read as email alerts and then to (2) explore whether family physicians purposefully retrieved these synopses. METHODS: We conducted a mixed-methods study in which a qualitative multiple case study explored the retrieval of email alerts within a prospective longitudinal cohort of practicing family physicians. Reading of research-based synopses was tracked in two contexts: (1) push, meaning to read on email and (2) pull, meaning to read after retrieval from one electronic knowledge resource. Dyads, defined as synopses first read as email alerts and subsequently retrieved in a search of a knowledge resource, were prospectively identified. Participants were interviewed about all of their dyads. Outcomes were the total number of dyads and their type. RESULTS: Over a period of 341 days, 194 unique synopses delivered to 41 participants resulted in 4937 synopsis readings. In all, 1205 synopses were retrieved over an average of 320 days. Of the 1205 retrieved synopses, 21 (1.7%) were dyads made by 17 family physicians. Of the 1205 retrieved synopses, 61 (5%) were retrieved from the knowledge resource.",

The objective of this study was to determine whether the presence of viable tumor in the surgical specimen could be predicted. METHODS: Between 1980 and 2003, 236 patients underwent PC-RPLND for clinical Stage IIA or III nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCT). The authors retrospectively reviewed the medical records of those patients for pertinent clinical and treatment-related outcomes.

Therefore, this study aims to determine if synovitis precedes the development of radiographic knee osteoarthritis (ROA). METHODS: The participants in this nested case-control study were selected from persons in the Osteoarthritis Initiative with knees that had a Kellgren Lawrence grading (KLG)=0 at baseline (BL). These knees were evaluated annually with radiography and non-contrast-enhanced MRI over 4\u2005years. MRIs were assessed for effusion-synovitis and Hoffa-synovitis. Case knees were defined by ROA (KLG\u22652) on the postero-anterior knee radiographs at any assessment after BL. Radiographs were assessed at P0 (time of onset of ROA), 1\u2005year prior to P0 (P-1) and at BL. Controls were participants who did not develop incident ROA (iROA) from BL to 48\u2005months). RESULTS: 133 knees of 120 persons with ROA (83 women) were matched to 133 control knees (83 women). ORs for occurrence of iROA associated with the presence of effusion-synovitis at BL, P-1 and P0 were 1.56 (95% CI 0.86 to 2.81), 3.23 (1.72 to 6.06) and 4.7 (1.10 to 2.95), respectively.

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: To describe the difficulties and differing techniques in the transcatheter placement of amplatz ventricular septal defect devices to close perimembranous ventricular septal defects and place these in the context of the expanding literature on ventricular septal defect catheter closure. BACKGROUND: Surgery remains the established first-line therapy for closure of haemodynamically significant perimembranous ventricular septal defects. Transcatheter techniques appeared to promise a possible alternative, obviating the need for cardiac surgery. However, significant technical and anatomical constraints coupled with ongoing reports of a high incidence of heart block have prevented these hopes from being realised to any significant extent. It is likely that there are important methodological reasons for the high complication rates observed. The potential advantages of transcatheter perimembranous ventricular septal defect closure over surgery warrant further exploration of differing transcatheter techniques. METHODS: Between August, 2004 and November, 2009, 21 patients had a perimembranous ventricular septal defect closed with transcatheter techniques. Of these, 14 were closed with a muscular amplatz ventricular septal defect device. The median age and weight at device placement were 8 years, ranging from 2 to 19 years, and 18.6 kilograms, ranging from 10 to 21 kilograms, respectively. RESULTS: There were 25 procedures performed on 23 patients using 21 amplatz ventricular septal defect devices. Median defect size on angiography was 7.8 millimetres, ranging from 4 to 14.3 millimetres, with a median device size of 8 millimetres, ranging from 4 to 18 millimetres, and a defect/device ratio of 1.4. There were no deaths or major complications. There were two minor complications, both of which were successfully managed. There were no cases of heart block.",

Thus it is possible that individuals who do not use repellents but dwell close to repellent users experience more bites than otherwise. The objective of this study was to measure if diversion occurs from households that use repellents to those that do not use repellents. METHODS: The study was performed in three Tanzanian villages using 15%-DEET and placebo lotions. All households were given LLINs. Three coverage scenarios were investigated: complete coverage (all households were given 15%-DEET), incomplete coverage (80% of households were given 15%-DEET and 20% placebo) and no coverage (all households were given placebo). A crossover study design was used and coverage scenarios were rotated weekly over a period of ten weeks. The placebo lotion was randomly allocated to households in the incomplete coverage scenario. The level of compliance was reported to be close to 100%. Mosquito densities were measured through aspiration of resting mosquitoes. Data were analysed using negative binomial regression models. FINDINGS: Repellent-users had consistently fewer mosquitoes in their dwellings. In villages where everybody had been given 15%-DEET, resting mosquito densities were fewer than half that of households in the no coverage scenario (Incidence Rate Ratio [IRR]=0.39 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.25-0.60); p<0.001). Placebo-users living in a village where 80% of the households used 15%-DEET were likely to have over four-times more mosquitoes (IRR=4.17; 95% CI: 3.08-5.65; p<0.001) resting in their dwellings in comparison to households in a village where nobody used 15%-DEET.",

METHOD: We used population-based (National Health Insurance) claims data covering all 253 618 singleton deliveries conducted at ob/gyn clinics, during 2000-02. The dependent variable, delivery mode, was treated as dichotomous [caesarean section (CS) = 1, vaginal delivery (VD) = 0]. The independent variable of interest was practice size, classified into four categories: 1, 2, 3 and 4+ physicians. Multilevel logistic regression modelling, accounting for clinic-level variation in CS rates, was used to examine CS likelihood by practice size, among the total delivery sample and among the sub-samples disaggregated by obstetric complication status. RESULTS: Solo practices have 7% excess caesarean cases relative to large group practices. After controlling for patient's age, physician demographics, the clinic's geographic location and size of delivery service, and clinic-level random effect, solo practice physicians were 5.38 times as likely as 4+ physician practices to provide caesarean delivery (CI = 4.18 approximately 6.93), 2-physician practices were 3.87 times (CI = 2.99 approximately 5.01) and 3-physician practices 2.72 times (CI = 2.06 approximately 3.59) as likely as 4+ physician practices to provide caesarean delivery. This effect is driven by higher CS propensity among solo and small groups among cases with obstetrically less salient complications and the 'no complications' subset of patients. Wide confidence intervals for odds ratios in these sub-samples also attest to the difficulty of interpreting the results.",

METHODS: Thirty patients were included with the mean age of 47.8 years (range 35 to 60 years). All patients underwent posterior lumbar instrumentation using hybrid fixation for lumbar stenosis with instability (13 cases), degenerative spondylolisthesis Meyerding grade I (6 cases), degenerative disc disease of one or more adjacent levels in six cases and mild lumbar degenerative scoliosis in five patients. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using Oswestry disability index (ODI), Roland and Morris disability questionnaire (RMDQ), and the visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores. All patients were assessed by preoperative, postoperative and follow-up standing plain radiographs and lateral X-rays with flexion and extension. Adjacent disc degeneration was also evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at follow-up. RESULTS: At a mean follow-up of 6.1 years, we observed on X-rays and/or MRI 3 cases of adjacent segment disease (10.0 %): two of them (6.6 %) presented symptoms and recurred a new surgery. The last patient (3.3 %) developed asymptomatic retrolisthesis of L3 not requiring revision surgery. The mean preoperative ODI score was 67.6, RMDQ score was 15.1, VAS back pain score was 9.5, and VAS leg pain score was 8.6. Postoperatively, these values improved to 28.1, 5.4, 3.1, and 2.9, respectively, and remained substantially unchanged at the final follow-up: (27.7, 5.2, 2.8, and 2.6).",

These aberrant cells could participate in the generation of epileptic activity. The aim of this study was to morphologically and electrophysiologically characterize cells in pediatric CD tissue. METHODS: We used infrared video-microscopy to visualize normal and abnormal-appearing cells. To characterize electrophysiological properties, we used whole-cell patch clamp recordings in tissue slices obtained from 42 cases of pediatric CD (ages 0.2-14 years). The pipette contained biocytin for determination of morphological features. RESULTS: Approximately 25% of recorded cells displayed morphologic differences compared with normal-appearing pyramidal neurons, and were divided as follows: immature, misoriented, dysmorphic, cytomegalic, and balloon cells. Immature cells displayed electrophysiological membrane properties typical of developing neurons. Misoriented pyramidal neurons and pyramidal neurons with dysmorphic processes displayed properties similar to normal-appearing pyramidal neurons. In contrast, cytomegalic neurons and balloon cells displayed abnormal membrane properties. Balloon cells had a very high input resistance and lacked voltage-gated Na+ and Ca2+ currents. Cytomegalic neurons had a very high membrane capacitance, very low input resistance, and showed signs of hyperexcitability, as exemplified by the occurrence of repetitive, slowly inactivating Ca2+ spikes when depolarized.",

METHODS: From January 1992 to December 1993, we examined 24 subjects (average age, 38.5 years) suffering from the so-called \"coup de fouet\" syndrome, which had appeared during physical activity: walking (nine cases), running (six cases), and sudden changes of position (nine cases). In all cases we performed a clinical and instrumental examination (analogical and tensive arterial and venous Doppler, arterial and venous duplex scanner, and color Doppler). RESULTS: Clinically we found, in 17 subjects, a hematoma in the posterior calf with increased thickness and, in 10 cases, with spontaneous sharp pain. In the other seven cases we found a modest hematoma without subjective or other objective symptoms. The arterial Doppler and scanner findings were normal.

This study reports the relationship between regional measures of intensive care capacity and low birth weight infants using newly developed market-based regions of neonatal intensive care. DESIGN: Cross-sectional small-area analysis of 246 neonatal intensive care regions (NICRs). DATA SOURCES: 1996 American Medical Association and American Osteopathic Association masterfiles data of clinically active neonatologists; 1999 American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Perinatal Pediatrics survey of directors of neonatal intensive care units in the United States with 100% response rate; 1995 linked birth/death data.

METHODS: Thirty-three patients who presented to our outpatient clinics with the symptoms of acute arthritis of unknown origin were enrolled in this study. We determined the serum concentrations of PCT and C-reactive protein and performed a white blood cell count. The definitive diagnosis was determined by microbiologic examination of a joint aspirate. RESULTS: Microbiologic cultures showed that 15 patients had septic arthritis. In these patients the PCT levels were significantly increased compared with those in the 18 patients with nonseptic arthritis (mean +/- SD, 1.18 +/- 1.66 ng/mL v 0.078 +/- 0.073 ng/mL; P = .001). On the basis of the normal range (<0.5 ng/mL), the test sensitivity in our series was 53.3% with a specificity of 100%. C-reactive protein levels in patients with septic arthritis were also significantly elevated compared with the nonseptic group. Because in either group no value was within the normal range (<0.5 mg/dL), the specificity was 0%.",

Such studies investigating gender-related differences have generally combined data from several centers. The aim of this study was to determine whether with modern aggressive treatment of CF this is still true when care is standardized within a single center. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of annual assessment data constructing two cross-sectional studies for the year 1993 (56 female patients, 49 male patients) and 2002 (115 female patients, 94 male patients) and two longitudinal studies, each lasting 5 years, starting in 1993 (21 female patients, 19 male patients) and 1998 (40 female patients, 41 male patients). Outcome measures included mortality, height, and weight SD scores (z scores), and percent predicted for lung function. RESULTS: In neither cross-sectional study were there significant differences between the sexes for median FEV(1) percent predicted (1993: female patients, 86%; male patients, 84%; 2002: female patients, 93%; male patients, 92%). Female height and weight z scores were at least as good as those of male scores. In the longitudinal studies, there were no clear trends toward declining lung function or growth, but the overall FEV1 percent predicted appeared to be better in female patients than male patients for both cohorts. This was statistically significant for the 1998 cohort (female median FEV1, 91.5% [range, 28 to 134%]; male median FEV1, 84.8% [range, 32 to 145%]; p<0.05).

Microstructural parameters at the locations examined provided only marginal additional information to quantitative computed tomography in predicting experimental failure strength. INTRODUCTION: It is unknown whether trabecular microstructure differs between thoracic and lumbar vertebrae and whether it adds significant information in predicting the mechanical strength of vertebrae in combination with QCT-based bone density. METHODS: Six mm cylindrical biopsies taken at mid-vertebral level, anterior to the center of the thoracic vertebra (T) 10 and the lumbar vertebra (L) 2 were studied with micro-computed tomography (microCT) in 165 donors (age 52 to 99 years). The segment T11-L1 was examined with QCT and tested to failure using a testing machine. RESULTS: The correlation of microstructural properties was moderate between T10 and L2 (r<or= 0.5). No significant differences were observed in the microstructural properties between the thoracic and lumbar spine, nor were sex differences at T10 or L2 observed. Cortical/subcortical density of T12 (r(2)=48%) was more strongly correlated with vertebral failure stress than trabecular density (r(2)=32%).

METHODS: Retrospective study of patients with Crohn's disease treated with ADA in Oxford, UK or Li\u00e8ge, Belgium. Treatment periods were divided into 6-month semesters. A combination therapy semester was defined as ADA+IS for at least 3 months; successful induction meant clinical response; a semester with flare as ADA dose escalation, starting steroids, perianal complication, or surgery; and ADA failure as ADA withdrawal for secondary loss of response or intolerance. Semesters with and without flares were compared through univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Successful induction was achieved in 171/207 (83%) patients, with no significant difference between ADA+IS and ADA monotherapy (85% vs. 82%, P = 0.50).

The severity of liver pathology has an impact on the presentation, course and prognosis of hepatobiliary lesions. This study aims to record the histological changes in the liver and response to surgery in patients with choledochal cyst and to correlate these with the clinical symptoms and recovery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All children<12 years diagnosed with choledochal cyst were evaluated clinically, radiologically and biochemically at presentation. Excision of the cyst with intra-operative liver biopsy was done. Liver biopsy was repeated after 6 months of surgery. Both the liver biopsies were compared objectively in terms of hepatocellular damage, cholestasis, parenchymal inflammation, bile duct inflammation, bile duct proliferation, portal fibrosis and central venous distension with appropriate statistical tests. Clinical presentation and recovery were correlated with grades of liver pathology. RESULTS: Forty-six patients were included. Pathological damage was observed in all the livers preoperatively. Post-operatively, significant resolution of histological changes was seen in hepatocellular damage (p<0.0001), parenchymal inflammation (p = 0.0001), cholestasis (p = 0.0003) and bile duct proliferation (p = 0.0001).

The spinal cord is considered to be tethered when there is a thick filum terminale or low-lying conus medullaris. It has also been reported that a normal level of the conus medullaris and normal thickness of the filum terminale do not mean that there is no cord tethering. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this investigation, we examined 21 fila terminalia; 5 of them were taken from cadavers, and these were used as a control group (group 1; n/n), 8 from patients with a normal appearance of the filum terminale but with clinical symptoms (incontinence) and pathologic results of a urodynamic study (group 2; n/ab), and 8 from patients with an abnormal appearance of the filum terminale and with clinical symptoms (group 3; ab/ab). Interestingly, we found that while fila terminalia in the control group were made up mainly of collagen fibers, more connective tissue with dense collagen fibers, some hyalinization and dilated capillaries were noticed in the fila from group 2. RESULTS: Our results suggest that these histological features may reflect a decreased elasticity within the filum terminale, resulting in a tethering effect on the lower conus in otherwise normal physiological conditions.",

        "input": "INTRODUCTION: Accidental carbon monoxide (CO) intoxication is a major cause of unintentional poisoning. This study aimed to determine the value of initial lactate levels in patients with CO poisoning and to evaluate its utilization in the emergency department (ED). METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was carried out among patients with CO intoxication, who were admitted to the ED between April 1, 2011 and April 1, 2012. The study data were extracted from a hospital database system using International Classification of Diseases-10 diagnosis codes. The patients were analyzed according to lactate levels, carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels, electrocardiographic manifestations, and clinical features at admission to the ED. RESULTS: A total of 74 patients with CO poisoning were enrolled in this study. The average COHb value of the patients was 21.5 \u00b1 13.9%. A total of 50 patients (67.6%) received normobaric oxygen treatment and 24 patients (32.4%) received hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment. The patients who received HBO treatment had increased lactate levels compared with patients receiving normobaric oxygen treatment (2.3 mmol/L vs. 1.0 mmol/L, p<0.001). The lactate levels were positively correlated with COHb values (r = 0.738, p<0.001). We determined that a lactate level of 1.85 mmol/L has a sensitivity of 70.8% and a specificity of 78.0% to predict the HBO treatment needed in CO poisoning.",

One limitation of this tool is the high rate of nondiagnostic tests. We aim to create a predictive model to discriminate a patient's risk for a nondiagnostic test. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of consecutive subjects admitted to our CPU and undergoing an ETT from January 2001 to December 2006. To account for any variation in physician practice, the training set was those patients admitted January 2004 to December 2006 and the testing set comprised those evaluated January 2001 to December 2003. Recursive partitioning with 10-fold cross validation was used to identify significant variables associated with the outcome measure of a nondiagnostic treadmill test. The beta coefficient from the regression model was used to create a risk score. This risk score was then used stratify patients. RESULTS: A total of 1708 subjects underwent ETT during the study period. The training set comprised 408 subjects with 62 having a nondiagnostic test. Logistic regression identified age, prior history of coronary artery disease, smoking, and diabetes variables used to create a scoring system. The testing set identified 387 (29.7) subjects meeting our criteria as low risk (9.0%) nondiagnostic test and identified 298 (22.9%) at high risk for a nondiagnostic test (32.8%).",

However, the Alteplase Thrombolysis for Acute Noninterventional Therapy in Ischemic Stroke (ATLANTIS B) trial, in which patients were treated mostly between 3 and 5 hours after symptom onset, found no overall benefit from rtPA. We hypothesized that a subgroup of patients at low risk for thrombolysis-related intracranial hemorrhage, identifiable on the basis of pretreatment clinical variables, may benefit even when treated after 3 hours, despite the overall results of the trial. METHODS: Using an independently derived multivariate model that predicts the risk of thrombolysis-related intracranial hemorrhage in patients receiving tPA for acute myocardial infarction (based on 6 easily obtainable clinical characteristics), we stratified patients in the ATLANTIS B trial into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk tertiles. We examined outcomes in the prespecified low-risk subgroup using a global test of significance across 4 outcome scales. RESULTS: Despite having a similar average baseline stroke severity and median time to treatment (270 minutes), patients in the prespecified low-risk group (n=194) were significantly less likely to have a symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage than other patients in the trial (2.2% versus 9.2%, P=0.03). Although there was no treatment effect for rtPA in the overall trial, a consistent trend favoring rtPA therapy (a 5% to 12% absolute treatment benefit) was found across 4 different stroke scales in the prespecified low-risk group.",

METHODS: Year 6 children and their parent were recruited from 40 primary schools. Results are presented for the 340 parent-child dyads with accelerometer data that met a>or = 3 day inclusion criteria and the 431 parent-child dyads with complete self-reported TV viewing. Over 80% of the dyads with valid TV viewing data included mothers and their child. Mean minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), minutes of sedentary time per day and counts per minute were assessed by accelerometer. Self-reported hours of TV viewing were coded into 3 groups (<2 hours per day, 2-4 hours per day and>4 hours per day. Linear and multi-nominal regression models were run by child gender to examine parent-child associations. RESULTS: In linear regression models there was an association for the overall sedentary time of girls and their parents (t = 2.04. p = .020) but there was no association between girls' and parents' physical activity.

        "input": "INTRODUCTION: Pancreatic cancer belongs to carcinomas associated with poor prognosis and low survival rate. It has been highlighted that the cancer risk is linked to both environmental and genetic factors. Available studies allow to estimate that genetic factors play a role in 5-10% of patients with pancreatic cancer. Beside other carcinomas, pancreatic cancer occurs in hereditary neoplastic syndromes associated with gene mutations, including CDKN2A, CHEK2, BRCA2. It has also been suggested that BRCA1 mutation is involved given the fact that BRCA1 mutation carriers are at increased risk for pancreatic cancer. However, a role of this mutation is not fully understood. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to assess the relationship between BRCA1 gene mutation and pancreatic cancer in Polish population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 88 pancreatic cancer patients (56 males and 35 females) and 3784 carriers of BRCA1 mutation from 1637 families were enrolled in the study. Almost 65% of pancreatic cancer patients were cigarette smokers. Genotyping for constitutive BRCA1 gene mutation was performed in all patients with pancreatic cancer.

RESULTS: Multivariate analysis of variance was used to examine gender differences in drinking across eight categories of situations assessed on the IDTS. Mediational analyses tested whether gender differences on these IDTS subscales may be mediated by depressive symptoms. We found support for the hypothesis that women report drinking more than men in response to unpleasant emotions and conflict with others, and that these associations are significantly mediated by depression severity.",

In an effort to remedy this situation, we examined the utility of conserved orthologous set (COSII) nuclear loci to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships among 29 diploid Solanum species in the sister clades that include tomato and potato, and in Datura inoxia as a far outgroup. We screened 40 COSII markers with intron content over 60% that are mapped in different chromosomes; selected a subset of 19 by the presence of single band amplification of size mostly between 600 and 1200 bp; sequenced these 19 COSII markers, and performed phylogenetic analyses with individual and concatenated datasets. The present study attempts to provide a fully resolved phylogeny among the main clades in potato and tomato that can help to identify the appropriate markers for future studies using additional species. RESULTS: Among potatoes, when total evidence is invoked, one single predominant history is highlighted with complete resolution within and among the three main clades. It also supports the hypothesis of the North and Central American B-genome origin of the tuber-bearing members of Solanum sect. Petota and shows a clear division between A genomes in clades 3 and 4, and B genomes in clade 1+2. On the other hand, when a prior agreement approach is invoked other potato evolutionary histories are revealed but with less support. These alternative histories could be explained by past hybridization, or fast rates of speciation. In the case of tomato, the analyses with all sequence data completely resolved 19 of 21 clades, for the first time revealed the presence of a single predominant history, and showed a clear division between A and B genomes.",

Theories focusing on these mechanisms differ in their description of the relationship between panic and fear. The main controversy concerns whether a PA resembles the classical flight response, or whether it is qualitatively different from fear. According to the first theory, a PA would result in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis) activation, whereas according to the second, it would not. So far, inconclusive results have been reported in studies measuring HPA-axis activity after laboratory evoked PA's. The present study was designed to assess cortisol levels following a 35% CO2 challenge in Panic Disorder (PD) patients compared to healthy volunteers as a measurement of HPA-axis activity. DESIGN: Twenty-three PD patients and 20 healthy volunteers participated in the study. Cortisol was determined in saliva at regular intervals before and after the challenge. Furthermore, attention was paid to possible gender effects. RESULTS: Although the 35% CO2 inhalation induced a significant increase in anxiety, no cortisol increase was found. Moreover, there was no difference between patient and control cortisol values following the 35% CO2 challenge, whereas the delta anxiety scores were far more pronounced in the patient group. Interestingly, male PD patients showed higher cortisol values.",

We evaluated the association of renal function and inotrope versus CF-LVAD support on posttransplant graft survival in status 1B patients. METHODS: The Scientific Registry for Transplant Recipients database was analyzed for posttransplant survival in status 1B patients bridged with inotropes or CF-LVAD who underwent transplantation between 2003 and 2012. Pretransplant renal function was measured by estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and was stratified as less than 45 mL \u00b7 min(-1) \u00b7 1.73 m(-2), 45 to 59, and 60 or greater. Univariate Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression models were used to evaluate the main effects of GFR strata and inotropes versus CF-LVAD, and the interaction effect of GFR strata by CF-LVAD, on graft survival. RESULTS: This study included 4,158 status 1B patients (74% male, aged 53 \u00b1 12 years). Of those, 659 patients had a CF-LVAD (HeartMate-II [Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA], n = 638; HVAD [HeartWare, Framingham, MA], n = 21), and 3,530 were receiving inotropes (31 CF-LVAD patients were also receiving inotropes).

METHODS AND RESULTS: Ten advanced HF patients (50.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.7 years), and 9 age-matched controls underwent vastus lateralis biopsy. Western blot analysis showed that sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA)2a, which is responsible for Ca(2+) sequestration into the sarcoplasmic reticulum(SR), was lower in HF versus controls (4.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5 vs 7.5 \u00b1 0.8 AU, P\u00a0=\u00a0.01).

It has been speculated that hepcidin insufficiency or dysregulation may be the primary defect in genetic hemochromatosis. METHODS: A 62-year-old woman underwent elective liver transplantation for chronic hepatitis C cirrhosis. Genetic testing for hemochromatosis was subsequently performed on the donor and recipient. Liver iron concentration was measured in the donated liver at the time of transplantation, and at day 2 and day 652 post-transplant. Serum hepcidin was measured at day 935 in the recipient and in three other liver transplant recipients. RESULTS: The donor was discovered to have significant iron overload without fibrosis, with a liver iron concentration of 326 micromol/g (normal is 0 micromol/g to 35 micromol/g). Genetic testing confirmed that the 89-year-old female donor was a typical C282Y homozygote for hemochromatosis. The recipient did not carry either the C282Y or the H63D mutation of the HFE gene for hemochromatosis.

The purposes of this study are to report the alveolar process thickness and inter-radicular space in the posterior region of the mandible, to assess the impact of different miniscrew insertion angle protocols, and to identify differences between the genders or types of malocclusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, 100 individuals were selected for orthodontic treatment at a radiology clinic. Cone-beam computed tomography data were imported into 3-dimensional software. The predictor variable was the location in the mandible and insertion angle. The demographic variables collected included age, gender, and malocclusion (Angle Classes I and II). The primary outcome variables were bone thickness and inter-radicular space. The inter-radicular spaces were evaluated 5 mm from the cement-enamel junction. The bone thicknesses were taken at 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, and 90\u00b0 in relation to the alveolar ridge, simulating a miniscrew insertion. These factors were evaluated for sexual dimorphism and malocclusion (Angle Classes I and II). Sexual dimorphism and malocclusion were evaluated with t tests. To compare the inter-radicular space and the thickness of bone between areas, an analysis of variance for repeated measures was used. RESULTS: The sample was composed of 100 patients with a mean age of 17.4 \u00b1 6.74 years. There were 61 female and 39 male patients and 60 Class I and 40 Class II molar relationships.

Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), eliminated in off-pump operations (OPCABG) may decrease the incidence of AF, whereas the combination of CABG with heart valve replacement may result in more frequent postoperative atrial fibrillation. The aim of our study was to compare the early postoperative AF incidence rate during ICU stay in three groups of patients: after CABG, OPCABG, and CABG combined with valve replacement. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective study of 906 consecutive patients was carried out between January 1999 and January 2000. Clinical profile of 906 patients, including factors having potential influence on postoperative AF did not showed any significant differences between the groups. The presence of arrhythmia history was the reason of excluding 85 patients from the statistical analysis.

        "input": "PURPOSE: Radiation synovectomy is frequently combined with intraarticular corticosteroid injection in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis to reduce local inflammation and lymphatic clearance of radiocolloid. However, this practice is not universally accepted because corticosteroids have local and systemic toxicity such as osteonecrosis and cartilage damage and whether simultaneous corticosteroid injection together with radiocolloids is necessary in other forms of chronic synovitis like patients with hemophilia remains to be determined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we performed radiosynoviorthesis in 14 joints of 12 patients with hemophilia with chronic knee synovitis without corticosteroid coadministration and measured radiocolloid leakage from the joint space. Five mCi Y-90 radiocolloid was injected under local anesthesia and the needle was flushed with additional lidocaine injection instead of corticosteroid. The joint was then manipulated through a full range of extension and flexion to distribute the particles homogeneously throughout the joint space. The joint was then splinted for 48 hours to minimize leakage from the joint space. After the immobilization period, radiocolloid leakage was evaluated using a gamma camera with a 20% window centered over the maximum Bremsstrahlung photopeak of Y-90. Regions of interest were drawn to the injection site on the knee joint and to the ipsilateral inguinal lymph node area. Leakage of radiocolloid was calculated by dividing the background-corrected counts/pixel at the inguinal region by the counts/pixel at the injection site. RESULTS: One of 12 patients who had knee arthroplasty was previously found to have a high amount of radiocolloid leakage from the knee joint. The other 11 patients had no radiocolloid leakage from the knee joint. The mean radiocolloid leakage from the knee joint was 0.0002% (range, 0.0001-0.0004%) of the injected dose. The mean radiocolloid leakage from the inguinal lymph node area was 0.0001% (range, 0.00005-0.0002%) of the injected dose.",

We measured by ultrasound (US) the perihepatic adipose tissue thickness (PATT), i.e. the thickness of the fat between the abdominal muscular layer and the hepatic surface, in addition to waist circumference, BMI, biochemistry and serum adipokines, to predict the severity of liver damage in NAFLD. METHODS: 63 NAFLD patients and 45 controls were studied. PATT and US steatosis score were assessed in all patients. Histology was obtained in those with an US steatosis score greater or equal to 2. RESULTS: PATT was 13.5 + or - 4.1 mm in NAFLD vs 8.0 + or - 4.1 in controls (p less than 0.001). A PATT value of 11.2 mm seems to represent a cut-off below which NAFLD is unlikely. Test sensitivity, specificity and the area under the ROC curve were 100%, 50% and 75%, respectively, suggesting a good discrimination between patients with non-NASH and those with NASH or borderline NASH. In addition, PATT strongly correlated with waist circumference (p less than 0.001). Both PATT and waist circumference correlated with US steatosis, HOMA-IR, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and leptin. Based on a multiple logistic regression analysis, waist circumferences greater or equal to 110, 113 and 122 cm were associated with a probability over or equal to 50% of abnormal HOMA-IR, TNF-alpha and leptin values, respectively.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1998 and June 2004, 444 patients with T1b-T3, N0 pNx, M0 prostate carcinoma were randomly assigned to either pelvic and prostate radiotherapy or prostate radiotherapy only. Patients were stratified according to the prognostic factor of lymph node involvement (LNI). Short-term 6-month neoadjuvant and concomitant hormonal therapy was allowed only for patients in the high-risk group. The pelvic dose was 46 Gy. The total dose recommended to the prostate was changed during the course of the study from 66 Gy to 70 Gy. Criteria for progression-free survival (PFS) included biologic prostate-specific antigen recurrences or a local or metastatic evolution. Acute and late toxicities were recorded according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and Late Effects in Normal Tissues Subjective, Objective, Management, and Analytic scales, respectively. The QOL outcome was recorded with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30, the International Prostatic Symptom Score, and the Sexual Function Index scales. RESULTS: With a 42.1-month median follow-up time, the 5-year PFS and overall survival were similar in the two treatment arms for the whole series and for each stratified group. On multivariate analysis, low LNI risk and hormonal therapy were statistically associated with increased PFS. However, subgroup analyses based on these factors did not show any benefit for pelvic irradiation. There were no significant differences in acute and late toxicities between the two arms.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Severe mitral regurgitation in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy increases the death rate and symptomatic status. The 1-year survival rate for medical therapy in this subset of patients is less than 20%. Transplantation is usually not feasible because of donor shortage and death while on the waiting list. METHODS: To assess additive risk, a retrospective chart review from 1993 to 1998 was performed comparing patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction [EF]<25%) and severe mitral regurgitation undergoing mitral valve repair and coronary artery bypass graft operations with patients with an EF of<25% undergoing coronary artery bypass graft alone. These groups were also compared with 140 patients receiving heart transplants since 1993 (group 3). RESULTS: The overall hospital death rate for group 1 was 6.3%. The one death occurred 2 weeks after surgery secondary to sepsis. This was not significantly different from the death rate of 4.1% in group 2. In group 1, there were two deaths at 1 year (87% survival rate), one related to heart failure. One patient was New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV at 1 year; the remainder of patients were NYHA class I-II. These results were not significantly different than the 8% death rate noted with transplantation. There was no change in EF and minimal residual mitral regurgitation in group 1 based on postoperative transesophageal echocardiography, whereas group 2 had an average 11.7% improvement in EF.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Recent literature has identified that children's performance on cognitive (or problem-solving) tasks can be enhanced when undertaken as a joint activity among pairs of pupils. Performance on this 'social' activity will require quality relationships between pupils, leading some researchers to argue that friendships are characterized by these quality relationships and, therefore, that friendship grouping should be used more frequently within classrooms. AIMS: Children's friendship grouping may appear to be a reasonable basis for cognitive development in classrooms, although there is only inconsistent evidence to support this argument. The inconsistency may be explained by the various bases for friendship, and how friendship is affected by cultural contexts of gender and schooling. This study questions whether classroom-based friendship pairings will perform consistently better on a cognitive task than acquaintance pairings, taking into account gender, age, and ability level of children. The study also explores the nature of school-based friendship described by young children. SAMPLE: 72 children were paired to undertake science reasoning tasks (SRTs). Pairings represented friendship (versus acquaintance), sex (male and female pairings), ability (teacher-assessed high, medium, and low), and age (children in Years 1, 3, and 5 in a primary school). METHOD: A small-scale quasi-experimental design was used to assess (friendship- or acquaintance-based) paired performance on SRTs. Friendship pairs were later interviewed about qualities and activities that characterized their friendships. RESULTS: Girls' friendship pairings were found to perform at the highest SRT levels and boys' friendship pairing performed at the lowest levels. Both boy and girl acquaintance pairings performed at mid-SRT levels. These findings were consistent across Year (in school) levels and ability levels. Interviews revealed that male and female friendship pairs were likely to participate in different types of activity, with girls being school-inclusive and boys being school-exclusive.",

Subsequent to peeling of the internal limiting membrane, six different illumination modes were enabled consecutively: mercury vapor, mercury vapor/xenon, and xenon followed by xenon combined with an amber, green or yellow spectral filter. Main outcome measure was the chromaticity spread between stained internal limiting membrane and unstained retina as a measure for the color contrast perceived by the human eye. RESULTS: Mean chromaticity scores were similar for all light sources: mercury vapor 7.97, mercury vapor/xenon 7.96 (p\u2009=\u20090.96), and xenon 7.41 (p\u2009=\u20090.55).

        "input": "UNLABELLED: OBJECTIVES/ HYPHOTHESIS: Surgical volumes have been shown in many fields to reflect expertise and to be associated with improved clinical outcomes. We sought to test similar hypotheses that neck dissection is a volume-sensitive procedure wherein the number of lymph nodes harvested and clinical outcomes are correlated with the number of neck dissections performed. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 375 neck dissections. The number of nodes harvested was examined by multiple linear regression before and after mathematical correction for pathologists' variation over time. The prior experiences of the surgeons were also averaged, depending on whether there was regional recurrence after at least 9 months of follow-up. RESULTS: More nodes were found by the pathologists over time, with 2.1 more nodes being found on average for each successive year (P<.001). After correcting for this effect of time, there remained a significant relationship between surgeons' experience and number of nodes harvested (P<.003). Additionally, cases that recurred were operated by less-experienced surgeons (P = .02).",

Different factors affect pHo, but it remains unclear whether pHo are genetically determined and whether they are related to other risk markers, such as the angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) and the plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1). METHODS: We measured fasting pHo, plasma levels of ACE (pACE), and PAI-1 antigen (PAI-1:ag) in 60 pairs of healthy monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) normotensive twins. Twin zygosity was determined with polymerase chain reaction analysis of informative minisatellite markers. pHo data were first analyzed with TWINAN90 to obtain estimates of genetic variance and heritability and then examined jointly in a path analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-one twins were MZ and 29 DZ. The mean pHo were 10.48 +/- 4.07 mumol/L (95% confidence interval, 9.73-11.24 mumol/L). Two pairs had to be excluded from further analysis because of overt hyperhomocyst(e)inemia resulting from concomitant drug treatment. Highly statistically significant intraclass correlation coefficients were observed both in MZ (r = 0.421; P = 0.008) and in DZ (r = 0.488; P = 0.004). Because all tests of genetic variance and heritability were not significant, the hypothesis of genetic variance and heritability of pHo was rejected. The preferred model of a likelihood-based analysis included an additive genetic influence (A), a common environmental influence (C), and an interaction between A and C. The estimated genetic influence was 0.0001, the common environmental influence was 0.0001, and the interaction between A and C was 0.0001.",

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether TKIs can be discontinued in these selected patients with mRCC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective analysis of medical records and imaging studies was performed on all patients with mRCC treated with TKIs (n=266) in five institutions. Patients with a CR under TKI treatment alone or with additional metastasectomy of residual disease following a partial response (PR), in which TKIs were discontinued, were included in the analysis. Outcome criteria analysed were time to recurrence of previous metastases, occurrence of new metastases, symptomatic progression, improvement of adverse events, and response to reexposure to TKIs. INTERVENTIONS: Sunitinib 50mg/day for 4 wk on and 2 wk off, sorafenib 800mg/day. MEASUREMENTS: Response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST).

METHODS: Between May 1996 and December 1998, partial left ventriculectomy and concomitant mitral valve surgery were performed in 62 patients (95% transplant candidates) with a mean age of 54 years (range 17-72 years). All patients were in New York Heart Association functional class III (38%) or IV (62%) because of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (59 patients) or ischemic, valvular, or familial cardiomyopathy (1 patient each). Outcomes considered for multivariable analysis included implantation of left ventricular assist device, return to class IV heart failure, relisting for transplantation, and death. RESULTS: Partial left ventriculectomy reduced the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter immediately preoperatively to immediately postoperatively (from 8.4 +/- 1.1 cm to 5.92 +/- 0.8 cm; P =.01), reduced the left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (from 133 +/- 48.6 mL to 64.1 +/- 26 mL; P<.0001), and increased the left ventricular ejection fraction (from 16 +/- 7.6 to 31.5 +/- 10.9; P<.0001).

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: In 1990, Fontan, Kirklin, and colleagues published equations for survival after the so-called \"Perfect Fontan\" operation. After 1988, we evolved a protocol using an internal or external polytetraflouroethylene tube of 16 to 19 millimetres diameter placed from the inferior caval vein to either the right or left pulmonary artery along with a bidirectional cava-pulmonary connection. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that a \"perfect\" outcome is routinely achievable in the current era when using a standardized surgical procedure. METHODS: Between 1 January, 1988, and 12 December, 2005, 112 patients underwent the Fontan procedure using an internal or external polytetraflouroethylene tube plus a bidirectional cava-pulmonary connection, the latter usually having been constructed as a previous procedure. This constituted 45% of our overall experience in constructing the Fontan circulation between 1988 and 1996, and 96% of the experience between 1996 and 2005. Among all surviving patients, the median follow-up was 7.3 years. We calculated the expected survival for an optimal candidate, given from the initial equations, and compared this to our entire experience in constructing the Fontan circulation. RESULTS: An internal tube was utilized in 61 patients, 97% of whom were operated prior to 1998, and an external tube in 51 patients, the latter accounting for 95% of all operations since 1999. At 1, 5, 10 and 15 years, survival of the entire cohort receiving polytetraflouroethylene tubes is superimposable on the curve calculated for a \"perfect\" outcome.",

        "input": "INTRODUCTION: Patients with COPD commonly exhibit pursed-lip breathing during exercise, a strategy that, by increasing intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure, may optimise lung mechanics and exercise tolerance. A similar role for laryngeal narrowing in modulating exercise airways resistance and the respiratory cycle volume-time course is postulated, yet remains unstudied in COPD. The aim of this study was to assess the characteristics of laryngeal narrowing and its role in exercise intolerance and dynamic hyperinflation in COPD. METHODS: We studied 19 patients (n=8 mild-moderate; n=11 severe COPD) and healthy age and sex matched controls (n=11). Baseline physiological characteristics and clinical status were assessed prior to an incremental maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test with continuous laryngoscopy. Laryngeal narrowing measures were calculated at the glottic and supra-glottic aperture at rest and peak exercise. RESULTS: At rest, expiratory laryngeal narrowing was pronounced at the glottic level in patients and related to FEV1 in the whole cohort (r=-0.71, p<0.001) and patients alone (r=-0.53, p=0.018). During exercise, glottic narrowing was inversely related to peak ventilation in all subjects (r=-0.55, p=0.0015) and patients (r=-0.71, p<0.001) and peak exercise tidal volume (r=-0.58, p=0.0062 and r=-0.55, p=0.0076, respectively).

However, only a proportion of patients achieve major molecular response. Hence, the need to find whether there are some factors that affect the response to treatment is essential. This study aimed to investigate the allele and genotype frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of SLCO1B3 (T334G) and CYP3A5*3 in CML patients undergoing imatinib treatment and to determine whether SNPs of these two genes could predict the response of imatinib therapy in CML patients. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We investigated SLCO1B3 (T334G) and CYP3A5*3 polymorphisms by Polymerase Chain Reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in 86 Philadelphia positive newly diagnosed Egyptian CML patients (78 patients in chronic phase and 8 patients in accelerated phase). All patients received imatinib therapy and were followed for at least one and half years. The response to imatinib therapy was evaluated by recording the hematological response, cytogenetic response, and molecular response according to the European Leukemia Net criteria. RESULTS: This study included 86 Philadelphia positive newly diagnosed CML patients, 78 in the early chronic phase and 8 in the accelerated phase. In the chronic phase patients, no association between SLCO1B3 (T334G) exon 3 polymorphism and response to imatinib therapy was detected (P = 0.938) while CYP3A5*3 gene polymorphism was associated with inferior outcome (P<0.001). In the group of accelerated phase patients, the SLCO1B3 (T334G) polymorphism was associated with inferior outcome (P = 0.001) while CYP3A5*3 gene polymorphism was not associated with response to imatinib therapy (P = 0.13).",

To test this hypothesis we investigated whether patients with schizophrenia showed impaired learning of task-relevant stimulus-reinforcement associations in the presence of distracting task-irrelevant cues. METHOD: We tested 20 medicated patients with schizophrenia and 17 controls on a reaction time game, the Salience Attribution Test. In this game, participants made a speeded response to earn money in the presence of conditioned stimuli (CSs). Each CS comprised two visual dimensions, colour and form. Probability of reinforcement varied over one of these dimensions (task-relevant), but not the other (task-irrelevant). Measures of adaptive and aberrant motivational salience were calculated on the basis of latency and subjective reinforcement probability rating differences over the task-relevant and task-irrelevant dimensions respectively. RESULTS: Participants rated reinforcement significantly more likely and responded significantly faster on high-probability-reinforced relative to low-probability-reinforced trials, representing adaptive motivational salience. Patients exhibited reduced adaptive salience relative to controls, but the two groups did not differ in terms of aberrant salience. Patients with delusions exhibited significantly greater aberrant salience than those without delusions, and aberrant salience also correlated with negative symptoms. In the controls, aberrant salience correlated significantly with 'introvertive anhedonia' schizotypy.",

A correlation may therefore exist between a screening unit's DCIS detection rate and their small invasive cancer detection rate. We have therefore investigated the effect of DCIS detection rate on the detection of small (<15 mm) invasive cancers in the 95 units of the U.K. NHS Breast Screening Programme (NHSBSP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: DCIS detection rates were examined against large (>or =15 mm) and small (<15 mm) invasive cancer detection rates in women aged 50-64 years at prevalent and incident screens over a 3-year period. RESULTS: After adjusting for background incidence, screening units with the highest DCIS detection of>or =1.3/1000 detected over 20% more small invasive cancers than units with DCIS detection rates within the NHSBSP guidelines of 0.5-1/1000 (P<0.001). Sixty percent of units had DCIS detection rates above the guidelines. There was no correlation between DCIS detection and>or =15 mm invasive cancer detection. The results suggest that over the range of DCIS rates studied, that for every two extra DCIS cancers detected, an additional small invasive cancer (<15 mm) is detected that may otherwise not have been. The results therefore provide supporting evidence that the detection of DCIS aids the detection of small invasive cancers.",

We aim to evaluate the effect of the initial LC on operative, postoperative, and pathologic outcomes of the first 60 RARC performed at our newly established robotics program. PATIENTS AND METHODS: After obtaining Institutional Review Board approval, we reviewed the clinical and pathologic data from 60 consecutive patients with clinically localized bladder cancer who underwent RARC with PLND from January 2008 to March 2010. The patients were grouped into tertiles and assessed for effect of LC using analysis of variance. RESULTS: Patient demographics and clinical characteristics were similar across tertiles. The mean total operative time trended down from the 1st to 3rd tertile from 525 minutes to 449 minutes, respectively (P=0.059). Mean estimated blood loss was unchanged across tertiles. Complications decreased as the LC progressed from 14 (70%) in the 1st tertile to 6 (30%) in each of the 2nd and 3rd tertiles (P<0.013).

Differentiating DIP from Parkinson's disease (PD) may be a challenge to clinicians. One of the factors distinguishing DIP from PD is that discontinuation of the neuroleptic agent in DIP should relieve the symptoms of parkinsonism. The majority of the literature uses the 6-month timeframe between the neuroleptic withdrawal and resolution of the symptoms of parkinsonism. METHODS: We report two cases of DIP wherein the symptoms of parkinsonism persisted more than 6-months from withdrawal of the dopamine receptor blocking agent (DRBA) and the results of their ioflupane iodine-123 (DaT) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan. DaT scan is a newly approved radiopharmaceutical in the United States indicated for striatal dopamine transporter visualization to assist in the evaluation of adult patients with suspected parkinsonian syndromes. RESULTS: The first case is a patient who developed parkinsonism from risperidone, while the second case developed parkinsonism from metoclopramide. In both cases, parkinsonism persisted 6 months after discontinuation of the DRBA, therefore DaT scan was obtained, showing normal striatal dopamine transporter uptake. Nine months after the discontinuation of the DRBA, parkinsonism was significantly improved in both patients but not completely resolved.",

Exclusion criteria were: macroscopic incomplete (R2) resection, use of local treatment modalities, and presence of extrahepatic disease. We aimed to resect all identified metastases with negative margins. However, when safe margins could not be obtained, resection was still performed provided complete macroscopic tumor removal. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival were compared between groups, and prognostic factors were identified. RESULTS: Of 840 patients, 436 (52%) were eligible for the study, 234 (28%) of whom underwent R0 resection, and 202 (24%) underwent R1 resection. Number and size of CLM were higher, and distribution was more often bilateral in the R1 group. After a mean follow-up of 40 months, 5-year OS was 61% and 57% for R0 and R1 patients (P = 0.27). Five-year disease-free survival was 29% in the R0 group versus 22% in the R1 group (P = 0.04). Multivariate analysis showed that R1 resection was an independent prognostic factor for poorer OS (P = 0.001) and disease-free survival (P = 0.001).",

        "input": "PURPOSE: There are no definitive randomized studies that compare radiotherapy (RT) with surgery for tonsillar cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of RT alone and RT combined with a planned neck dissection for carcinoma of the tonsillar area and to compare these data with the results of treatment with primary surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred patients were treated between October 1964 and December 1997 and observed for at least 2 years. One hundred forty-one patients underwent planned neck dissection, and 18 patients received induction (17 patients) or concomitant (one patient) chemotherapy. RESULTS: Five-year local control rates, by tumor stage, were as follows: T1, 83%; T2, 81%; T3, 74%; and T4, 60%. Multivariate analysis revealed that local control was significantly influenced by tumor stage (P =.0001), fractionation schedule (P =.0038), and external beam dose (P =.0227). Local control after RT for early-stage cancers was higher for tonsillar fossa/posterior pillar cancers than for those arising from the anterior tonsillar pillar. Five-year cause-specific survival rates, by disease stage, were as follows: I, 100%; II, 86%; III, 82%; IVa, 63%; and IVb, 22%. Multivariate analysis revealed that cause-specific survival was significantly influenced by overall stage (P =.0001), planned neck dissection (P =.0074), and histologic differentiation (P =.0307). The incidence of severe late complications after treatment was 5%.",

METHODS: Multivariate simultaneous equations regression was used to analyze data on tobacco industry campaign contributions to state legislators and legislators' tobacco control policy scores in 6 states. Campaign contributions were obtained from disclosure statements available in the specific state agency that gathers such information in each state. Tobacco policy scores were derived from a survey of key informants working on tobacco issues in each state. RESULTS: As tobacco industry contributions increase, a legislator's tobacco policy score tends to decrease (i.e., become more pro-tobacco industry). A more pro-tobacco position was associated with larger contributions from the industry. These results were significant even after controls for partisanship, majority party status, and leadership effects. In California, campaign contributions were still significantly related to tobacco policy scores after controls for constituent attitudes and legislators' personal characteristics.",

        "input": "OBJECTIVES: The objective was to test for significant differences in subjective and objective pretest probabilities for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in a large cohort of chest pain patients stratified by race or gender. Secondarily we wanted to test for any differences in rates of ACS, rates of 90-day returns, cost, and chest radiation exposure after these stratifications. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a prospective outcomes study of ED patients with chest pain and shortness of breath. We performed two separate analyses. The data set was divided by gender for analysis 1 while the analysis 2 stratification was made by race (nonwhite vs. white). For each analysis, groups were compared on several variables: provider visual analog scales (VAS) for likelihood of ACS, PREtest Consult ACS probabilities, rates of ACS, total radiation exposure to the chest, total costs at 30 days, and 90-day recidivism (ED, overnight observations, and inpatient admissions). RESULTS: A total of 844 patients were studied. Gender information was present on all 844 subjects, while complete race/ethnicity information was available on 783 (93%) subjects. For the first analysis, female patients made up 57% (478/844) of the population and their mean provider VAS scores for ACS were significantly lower (p = 0.000) at 14% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 13% to 16%) than that of males at 22% (95% CI = 19% to 24%). This was consistent with the objective pretest ACS probabilities subsequently calculated via the validated online tool, PREtest Consult, which were also significantly lower (p = 0.000) at 2.7% (95% CI = 2.4% to 3.0%) for females compared to 4.2% (95% CI = 3.8% to 4.7%) for males.

Case studies suggest a positive effect of cervical spine treatment on tinnitus complaints in patients with CST, but no experimental studies are available. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of a multimodal cervical physical therapy treatment on tinnitus complaints in patients with CST. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. PATIENTS: Patients with a combination of severe subjective tinnitus (Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI): 25-90 points) and neck complaints (Neck Bournemouth Questionnaire (NBQ)\u00a0>\u00a014 points). INTERVENTION: All patients received cervical physical therapy for 6 weeks (12 sessions). Patients were randomized in an immediate-start therapy group (n\u00a0=\u00a019) and a 6-week delayed-start therapy group (n\u00a0=\u00a019). MEASUREMENTS: TFI and NBQ-scores were documented at baseline, after the wait-and-see period in the delayed-start group, after treatment and after 6 weeks follow-up. The Global Perceived Effect (GPE) was documented at all measuring moments, except at baseline. RESULTS: In all patients (n\u00a0=\u00a038) TFI and NBQ-scores decreased significantly after treatment (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04 and p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). NBQ-scores remained significantly lower after follow-up (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001).

General practice is the ideal setting to address these inequalities however these patients engage less in preventive activities and experience difficulties navigating health services. This study aimed to compare primary care patients with and without sufficient health literacy in terms of their lifestyle risk factors, and explore factors associated with receiving advice and referral for these risk factors from their GPs. METHODS: A mailed survey of 739 patients from 30 general practices across four Australian states was conducted in 2012. Health literacy was measured using the Health Literacy Management Scale. Patients with a mean score of<4 within any domain were defined as having insufficient health literacy. Multilevel logistic regression was used to adjust for clustering of patients within practices. RESULTS: Patients with insufficient health literacy (n = 351; 48%) were more likely to report being overweight or obese, and less likely to exercise adequately. Having insufficient health literacy increased a patient's chance of receiving advice on diet, physical activity or weight management, and referral to and attendance at lifestyle modification programs. Not speaking English at home; being overweight or obese; and attending a small sized practice also increased patients' chances of receiving advice on these lifestyle risks. Few (5%, n = 37) of all patients reported being referred to lifestyle modification program and of those around three-quarters had insufficient health literacy. Overweight or obese patients were more likely to be referred to lifestyle modification programs and patients not in paid employment were more likely to be referred to and attend lifestyle programs.",

Because an increasing number of elderly patients are undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), the question arises whether a less extensive surgical approach is more prudent than complete revascularization. METHODS: Of 6531 patients undergoing isolated CABG, 859 were 75 and older at the time of operation. Mean age of the 859 patients was 77+/-2.7 years (median: 76 years); 65% were men. Follow-up enquiry by questionnaire was performed at the 180th postoperative day with a completeness of 95.6%. Assessment of the impact of incomplete revascularization utilized both multivariable analysis and propensity score matching to account for selection factors. RESULTS: Incomplete revascularization was performed in 133 patients (16%). The most common reasons for incomplete revascularization were small vessels (55%) and massive calcification (32%). Mortality until 180 days after CABG was higher (n=32; 24%) after incomplete than after complete revascularization (n=105; 15%; P=0.005). By logistic multivariable regression, incomplete revascularization was identified as an independent risk factor for death (Odds ratio, 1.8; P=0.015). By time-related analysis, incomplete revascularization predominantly affected the early period after CABG (P=0.001).

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which perception of empowerment by Arab adults living with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) was associated with better glycemic control and self-care management. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was led among 300 Arab adults living in Oman with T2DM in an outpatient diabetes clinic. The Diabetes Empowerment Scale (DES), glycosylated haemaglobin (HbA1c) and Body mass index was assessed. The DES was found to be valid and reliable for the population. ANOVA, Regression analysis, and Structural equation modeling was used for analysis. RESULTS: The composite score and three subscales of DES were a significant and strong predictor of good glycemic control among Omani adults with T2DM (p<0.001). Age, education, duration of DM, prior DM education program and medications were significantly associated with DES.",

        "input": "PURPOSE: Video laryngoscopy (VL) is an innovation in tracheal intubation that could be beneficial in an emergency situation. However, the technique could be detrimental if it prolongs intubation performed by an inexperienced physician. The purpose of this study was to compare direct laryngoscopy (DL) with VL skill for oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS) residents and practitioners to assess the practicality of recommending the inclusion of VL as a component of OMS emergency airway management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To address the research purpose, the authors designed and implemented a randomized crossover study investigating the performance of OMS residents and practitioners to intubate a mannequin using DL versus VL. The predictor variables were the experience level of the participants and their ability to intubate with DL and with VL. The outcome variables were time to view cords, the Cormack-Lehane glottis view achieved, the time to intubate the mannequin, and the total time for performing laryngoscopy and intubation. Comparisons of laryngoscopy and intubation and resident and practitioner experiences were compared using Cox proportional hazards survival analysis. RESULTS: Data from 22 OMS residents and 26 practitioners were assessed. The comparison outcomes between DL and VL showed that the time to view cords was shorter for VL, the Cormack-Lehane glottis view was better for VL, the time to intubate was shorter for DL, and the total time between techniques was not statistically different. OMS practitioners showed better times than OMS residents and showed adeptness with VL that was comparable to that of experienced practitioners.",

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: The present studies tested whether distance estimation training with metric feedback can degrade the performance of untrained primarily perceptual-motor tasks. BACKGROUND: Training with metric feedback can improve distance estimations. However, previous research led to the conclusion that those improvements stemmed from changes in cognitive processing rather than in perception. If trainees applied their new cognitive strategies to primarily perceptual-motor tasks, then the performance of those tasks should degrade. The present studies tested that possibility. METHOD: Experiment 1 sought to replicate that training with metric feedback would improve metric distance estimations. Experiments 2 and 3 investigated whether such training would degrade the performance of a primarily perceptual-motor task. Experiment 4 investigated whether such training would affect a perceptual-motor task that required cognition. RESULTS: Metric feedback improved metric distance estimation (Experiments 1-4) and throwing to a specified distance (Experiment 4). Metric feedback degraded throwing to a target (Experiments 2 and 3), although that effect was not evident when pretesting was omitted (Experiment 3).",

CT-based rigidity analysis (CTRA) is a sensitive and specific method, yet its influence on clinical decision-making has never been quantified.QUESTIONS/ PURPOSES: What is the influence of CTRA on providers' perceived risk of fracture? (2) What is the influence of CTRA on providers' treatment recommendations in simulated clinical scenarios of metastatic bone disease of the femur? (3) Does CTRA improve interobserver agreement regarding treatment recommendations? METHODS: We conducted a survey among 80 academic physicians (orthopaedic oncologists, musculoskeletal radiologists, and radiation oncologists) using simulated vignettes of femoral lesions presented as three separate scenarios: (1) no CTRA input (baseline); (2) CTRA input suggesting increased risk of fracture (CTRA+); and (3) CTRA input suggesting decreased risk of fracture (CTRA-). Participants were asked to rate the patient's risk of fracture on a scale of 0% to 100% and to provide a treatment recommendation. Overall response rate was 62.5% (50 of 80). RESULTS: When CTRA suggested an increased risk of fracture, physicians perceived the fracture risk to be slightly greater (37% \u00b1 3% versus 42% \u00b1 3%, p<0.001; mean difference [95% confidence interval {CI}] = 5% [4.7%-5.2%]) and were more prone to recommend surgical stabilization (46% \u00b1 9% versus 54% \u00b1 9%, p<0.001; mean difference [95% CI] = 8% [6.8%-9.2%]). When CTRA suggested a decreased risk of fracture, physicians perceived the fracture risk to be slightly lower (32% \u00b1 3% versus 37% \u00b1 3%, p<0.001; mean difference [95% CI] = -5% [-6.2%- -4.8%]) and were more prone to recommend conservative treatment (44% \u00b1 10% versus 52% \u00b1 10%, p<0.001; mean difference [95% CI] = 8% [-6.2%- -10.2%]).

It is not clear whether pitching experience and/or age creates biomechanical differences at the elbow and whether these differences place an athlete at greater risk. HYPOTHESES: (1) Youth pitchers will have differing elbow kinematics with regard to flexion/extension, internal/external rotation, and pronation/supination when compared with nonbaseball athletes and (2) younger youth pitchers will have differing elbow kinematics when compared with older youth pitchers. STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4. METHODS: Twenty-seven healthy male youths age 10 to 18 years were recruited and divided into an experience group (n = 18 pitchers) and a no experience group (n = 9 nonbaseball athletes). The experience group was subdivided by age into the younger experience subgroup (n = 10 pitchers) and the older experience subgroup (n = 8 pitchers). Biomechanics were recorded using an electromagnetic motion tracking system. Subjects from each group were averaged together, and a Mann-Whitney U test was utilized for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The experience group had greater external rotation during late cocking (-47.8\u00b0 vs 5.8\u00b0) and greater flexion during early cocking (112.8\u00b0 vs 100.1\u00b0).

In contrast, immunomodulators only play a marginal role. As anti-TNF therapy is very costly, it is prescribed in outpatient services of hospitals rather than in gastroenterological practices.AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate possible gender-related differences in the therapeutic management of IBD patients treated in the Rhein-Main region of Germany. METHODS: Data records about past medical history, disease status, laboratory values and medical treatment of outpatients of 10 gastroenterological practices and 3 hospitals were collected from November 1st 2005 to July 31st 2007 and analysed with regard to gender-related differences in therapy and disease management. RESULTS: Overall, no statistically significant difference in gender-specific medical treatment could be observed in the study cohort. However, detailed analyses revealed, that 1. women suffering from IBD, who are treated in outpatient services of hospitals, are more often under immunosuppressants, irrespective of disease activity, 2. in gastroenterological practices less than 3 % of patients are prescribed any immunosuppressive therapy (vs. 17 % [men] und 42 % [women]in hospital outpatient services), and 3. anti-TNF therapy is applied more frequently in men as compared to women in hospital outpatient services in both remission and active disease.",

Immunological abnormalities during the acute phase of KD have been described extensively. However, the occurrence of a second immunological disorder in a patient with a history of KD is rarely reported. We evaluated the presence of autoimmune thyroiditis and coeliac disease (CD) in patients with KD diagnosis. METHODS: Ninety consecutive children (57 males and 33 females, median age 5.2 yr, age range 1.6-14.1 yr) with KD were evaluated. All patients were evaluated for thyroid function (thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroxine and triiodothyronine), anti-thyroglobulin (TgA) and anti-peroxidase (TPOA) antibodies, and antigliadin, anti-endomysium and antitransglutaminase antibodies. CD was confirmed by jejunal biopsy if the specific antibody profile was positive. One hundred and fifty Italian children, matched for age and sex and from the same geographic area, acted as controls. RESULTS: A total of five patients (three boys, two girls; 5.5%; P<0.05) were found positive for coeliac antibodies. In all of these patients the diagnosis of CD was confirmed histologically.

Primary anastomosis (PA) with or without defunctioning loop ileostomy (DI) seems a good alternative. The aim of this study was to assess differences in the rate of stomal reversal after HP and PA with DI and to evaluate factors associated with postreversal morbidity in patients operated for acute perforated diverticulitis. METHOD: All 158 patients who had survived emergency surgery for acute perforated diverticulitis in five teaching hospitals in The Netherlands between 1995 and 2005 and underwent HP or PA with DI were retrospectively studied. Age, gender, ASA-classification, severity of primary disease, delay of stoma reversal, surgeon's experience, surgical procedure and type of anastomosis were analysed in relation to outcome after stoma reversal. RESULTS: Of the 158 patients, 139 had undergone HP and 19 PA with DI. The reversal-rate was higher in patients with DI (14/19; 74%) compared to HP (63/139; 45%) (P = 0.027) Delay between primary surgery and stoma reversal was shorter after PA with DI compared with HP (3.9 vs 9.1 months; P<0.001). Cumulative postreversal morbidity after HP was 44%. Early surgical complications occurred in 22 of 63 patients. Morbidity after DI reversal was 15% (P<0.001). Three patients died after HP reversal, none died after DI reversal. Anastomotic leakage was more frequent after HP (11/63; 17%) compared to DI (0/14; 0%) (P = 0.001).",

METHODS: Both t-PSA and f-PSA values of frozen sera obtained pretherapeutically from 80 patients with prostate carcinoma (PC) and 171 patients with benign hyperplasia of the prostate (BPH) were analyzed by means of the Tandem-E PSA and Tandem-R f-PSA immunoassays (Hybritech, San Diego, Calif.). RESULTS: At 95% specificity, a cutoff value of 15.7 micrograms/l was obtained for t-PSA [9 patients with BPH (5%) were above this value]. For this cutoff value, we calculated a sensitivity of 50% (40 patients with PC were above this value). Using the same criteria for the ratio (Q) f-PSA:t-PSA a cutoff of 0.086 was found again at a specificity of 95%. In a second step, only patients with t-PSA values below the cutoff level of 15.7 micrograms/l were considered. Out of these patients, 6 of 156 with BPH (missing values = 6) and 11 of 40 with PC were below the above-mentioned ratio (Q = 0.086). Therefore, sensitivity was 28% for this subgroup.

We examined the effects on mortality of both a diagnosis of depression at hospital admission and a history of previous depression, taking into account potential sources of bias (sample selection and confounding). METHODS: Medical inpatients aged 65+ with at most mild cognitive impairment were recruited at two Montreal hospitals and were screened for depression. All those with a diagnosis of major or minor depression (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition [DSM-IV] criteria) and a random sample of nondepressed patients were invited to participate. Baseline data included: history of previous depression, severity of physical illness, comorbidity, and health services utilization. Cox proportional hazards methods were used to analyze survival during the 16- to 52-month follow-up period. RESULTS: Five hundred patients were enrolled; 116 (23.2%) had a history of previous depression. After adjustment for demographic factors, physical illness, cognitive impairment, and prior service utilization, the only depression group with significantly different mortality was patients with both current major depression and a history of depression, who had lower mortality than all other patient groups (hazard ratio 0.42; 95% confidence interval: 0.25, 0.70).",

Typically, a set of criteria determines those subjects that may be included in the database. This study examined whether a criterion of normal performance on an established perimeter generates a subgroup with supernormal perimetric performance. METHODS: The right-eye perimetric results of 100 subjects were analyzed. Subjects had visual acuities of 6/12 or better, no history of eye disease, and normal slit lamp biomicroscopic and ophthalmoscopic examinations. Subjects performed test-retest visual field examinations on a Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA) 24-2 test (Zeiss Humphrey Systems, Dublin, CA), and on a custom frequency-doubling (FD) perimeter with targets spaced in the same 24-2 pattern. RESULTS: Test-retest correlation (Spearman rank correlation coefficients, rs) for mean defect (MD) and pattern SD (PSD) were 0.65 and 0.40 (HFA), and 0.82 and 0.39 (FD perimeter). Three subjects with HFA MDs in the lower 5% had similarly low MDs on retest, whereas no subject was common between the test and retest for the lower 5% of HFA PSD. Correlation between the HFA and FD test results were 0.41 (MD) and 0.05 (PSD). Based on these correlations, the bias introduced into perimetric probability limits were determined, by using Monte Carlo simulations.",

RESULTS: When all 3,287 sputum samples were examined in duplicate and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease cut-off for positivity was applied, more positives were not found by bleach sedimentation. Using the much lower American Thoracic Society (ATS) threshold, the percentage positives rose slightly from 15.5% for direct smear to 16.6% after bleach. The gain was more evident when suspect examinations only were taken into consideration, as bleach missed many positives identified by direct follow-up smear. When patients rather than individual smears were counted, more suspects were detected by bleach (10% gain on average), but with considerable variation between the centres (range 6-16%). To arrive at this gain, the ATS cut-off was used, with corrections for false results. Under routine conditions, however, this threshold is too low in view of possible transfer of AFB.",

METHODS: Using data from 1999 to 2006 for a random 5% sample of US Medicare beneficiaries, we identified individuals who experienced an incident hip, clinical vertebral, or wrist/forearm fracture in 2000 or 2001. We evaluated the risk for a second incident fracture versus death in the following 5 years. Results were stratified by age, gender, race/ethnicity, and medical comorbidities. In light of the competing mortality risk, and assuming 30% efficacy of an osteoporosis medication to prevent a second fracture, we calculated the number of individuals needed to treat (NNT) for 5 years after first fracture to prevent 1 additional subsequent fracture. RESULTS: We identified 18,853, 12,751, and 7635 persons with an incident hip, clinical vertebral, and wrist/forearm fracture, respectively. Although the 5-year risk of death usually exceeded the risk for second fracture across age, gender, racial groups, and primary fracture type (median ratio of death to second fracture=1.4, interquartile range 0.9, 2.0), the 5-year risk for second fracture was high, varying from a low of 13% to a high of 43%. Across demographic groups, the NNT to prevent a second fracture was 10 to 20.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Nonambulatory children with myelodysplasia are most likely to develop spinal deformity. As the deformity progresses, the overall health of the patient deteriorates. Traditional management of the deformity with fusion results in a short trunk, crankshaft deformity, and spine and lung growth inhibition. One alternative that potentially minimizes these problems is the vertebral expandable prosthetic titanium rib (VEPTR).QUESTIONS/ PURPOSES: We therefore asked whether the use of the VEPTR in immature nonambulating children with myelodysplasia with spinal deformity would (1) correct deformity; (2) allow growth; and (3) allow adequate respiratory function. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 20 nonambulatory patients with myelodysplasia who were part of a multicenter Investigational Device Exemption study of 214 patients treated with the VEPTR system. Demographics, standard radiographic measurements, pulmonary function parameters, and complications in 16 patients were analyzed. Average age at first surgery was 48.6 months. The minimum followup was 25 months (mean, 59 months; range, 25-164 months). RESULTS: The Cobb angle decreased postoperatively in nine patients, increased less than 10\u00b0 in five patients, and increased less than 20\u00b0 in two patients. The mean increase in thoracic spinal length (growth) by year after the initial procedure with lengthening was 0.48 cm. Ventilatory function improved in 11 patients and deteriorated in five patients. Intraoperative complications occurred in two patients. Complications directly related to the implant were seven infections and five implant migrations.",

OBJECTIVES: To characterize ED visits for chronic cardiorespiratory diseases in which dyspnea is a prominent symptom. Visit demographics and relations among reasons for presenting, visit urgency, medications, and visit disposition were examined. METHODS: Data for this cross-sectional descriptive-exploratory study came from the 1992 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. All adult ED visits in the dataset for asthma (n = 395), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; n = 239), and congestive heart failure (CHF; n = 320), as well as for mixed and restrictive chronic lung diseases (n = 18 and n = 14, respectively), were analyzed. RESULTS: Dyspnea was the most common reason for ED visit across diagnoses, and was associated with an approximate twofold increase in likelihood of admission for patients with COPD (odds ratio [OR] = 1.9, p<.04), and, controlling for age, CHF (OR = 1.7, p = .035). Dyspnea, alone or controlling for age, did not significantly increase the likelihood of admission for asthma. However, across all diagnoses, dyspnea was associated with a two- to threefold increase in the likelihood of receiving intravenous (i.v.) fluids (p<or = .006), whereas receiving an i.v. markedly increased the likelihood of admission (OR = 10.0, p<.0001 for COPD; OR = 10.2, p<.0001 for CHF).",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety-six Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 2 (groups E and L). Each group was further subdivided into 6 subgroups (EA1, EA2, EA3, EB1, EB2, EB3, LA1, LA2, LA3, LB1, LB2, LB3), each containing 8 rats. Intestinal anastomosis was performed by polyglactin 910 sutures in A subgroups and with ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate in B subgroups. The anastomosis was end to end in A1 and B1, side to side in A2 and B2, and end to side in A3 and B3. Time for anastomosis performance (AT) was recorded. In group E, bursting pressures and hydroxyproline levels were determined on the second postoperative day, whereas in group L, the same measurements were made on the sixth postoperative day. One-way analysis of variance was used for analyses of variance in the groups. Quantitative data were analyzed with Student's t test. P value was considered significant at less than .05. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between bursting pressures of subgroup pairs on both postoperative days 2 and 6. Hydroxyproline levels and AT were significantly better in B subgroups.",

OBJECTIVES: To quantify the BoD related to indoor air in The Netherlands, and to compare the outcomes with a previous study (EnVIE), which used a different BoD methodology. RESULTS: The largest BoD was attributable to environmental tobacco smoke. The next most important indoor air pollutants were radon and thoron from soils and building materials, followed by dampness and carbon monoxide (CO). Formaldehyde exposure did not contribute to the total BoD, according to our estimates. The EnVIE estimate was three times higher, and the most important indoor air pollutants by BoD were combustion products from outdoor sources, bioaerosols due to dampness and by outdoor sources, volatile organic compounds, radon from soils, pathogens and CO.

Continuous lumbar epidural analgesia, in contrast to thoracic epidural analgesia, may inhibit urinary bladder function. Postoperative urinary drainage has been common in patients with continuous epidural analgesia, despite the lack of scientific evidence for its indication after thoracic epidural analgesia. This study describes 100 patients who underwent elective colonic resection with 48 hours of continuous thoracic epidural analgesia and only 24 hours of urinary drainage. METHODS: This is a prospective, uncontrolled study with well-defined general anesthesia, postoperative analgesia, and nursing care programs in patients with a planned 2-day hospital stay, urinary catheter removal on the first postoperative morning, and epidural catheter removal on the second postoperative morning. Follow-up in the outpatient clinic was on days 8 and 30. RESULTS: Nine patients needed bladder recatheterization, 8 as a single procedure and 1 patient a second recatheterization with removal on day 7. This patient had urinary infection on day 10 and was readmitted for 5 days because of urosepsis and, subsequently, for cystitis and left-sided epididymitis.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether concordance with the WCRF/AICR recommendations was related to cancer risk in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. DESIGN: The present study included 386,355 EPIC participants from 9 European countries. At recruitment, dietary, anthropometric, and lifestyle information was collected.

We used multivariable logistic regression to determine whether the choice of radiation therapy vs radical prostatectomy varied by distance among patients living in rural and urban areas. Analyses were adjusted for geographic location within the United States, age, race, Charlson/Deyo comorbidity score, year of diagnosis, income quartile, education quartile, Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen level, and T stage. RESULTS: Patients living in urban or rural areas were less likely to receive radiation compared with surgery if they lived farther from the treatment facility.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Awareness of the economic burden of diabetes has led to a number of studies on economic issues. However, comparison among cost-of-illness studies is problematic because different methods are used to arrive at a final cost estimate. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to show how estimates of hospitalisation costs for diabetic patients can vary significantly in relation to the statistical method adopted in the analysis. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study analyses diabetic patients' costs as a function of demographic and clinical covariates, by applying the following statistical survival models: the parametric survival model assuming Weibull distribution, the Cox proportional hazard (PH) model and the Aalen additive regression for modelling costs. The Aalen approach is robust both for the non proportionality in hazard and for departures from normality. In addition it is able to easily model the effect of covariates on the extreme costs. This cost analysis is based on data collected for a retrospective observational study analysing repeated hospitalisations (N = 4816) in a cohort of 3892 diabetic patients. RESULTS: There is agreement in all models with the effects of the considered covariates (age, sex, duration of disease and presence of other pathologies). An effect of over- or under-estimation, according to the chosen model due to arguably inappropriate model fitting, was observed, being more evident for some specific profiles of the patients, and overall accounting for as much as 20% of the estimated effect. The Aalen model was able to cope with all the other models in furnishing unbiased estimates with the advantage of a greater flexibility in representing the covariates' effect on the cost process.",

However, isolated reports of fatal hypernatremia after irrigation with normal saline have raised safety concerns about frequent colonic irrigation in children. Significant electrolyte abnormalities have also been reported with hypertonic phosphate and high colonic tap water enemas. Because our patients routinely use tap water for Malone antegrade continence enema irrigations, we examined the safety profile of this practice MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the last 3.5 years 71 patients at our institution have used antegrade tap water enemas for managing fecal incontinence or intractable constipation. Standard serum electrolytes were measured RESULTS: We obtained 101 sets of serum electrolyte measurements in 71 patients at a mean of 8.4 months postoperatively (range 1 to 33). A girl who presented with severe hyponatremia and hypochloremia had not used the Malone antegrade continence enema for several days. The most interesting finding was significantly elevated sodium and chloride in 1 case 6 weeks after surgery that was associated with tap water treated with a home softening system.

However, wide variations in insulin sensitivity are noted in obese youth. It is not clear if greater insulin resistance confers a higher risk of cardiovascular comorbidities and risk for type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated physical and metabolic features of 54 obese adolescents. Subsequently, we pair matched 17 moderately insulin-resistant (MIR group) to 17 severely insulin-resistant (SIR group) youth based on cut points for insulin sensitivity (MIR group insulin sensitivity within 2 SDs and SIR group<2 SDs of normal-weight adolescent values). We evaluated differences in body composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), abdominal fat (computed tomography scan), cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) (Vo(2max) on a treadmill), insulin sensitivity and secretion (hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamps), substrate utilization (indirect calorimetry), and fasting adiponectin and lipid profile. RESULTS: SIR youth had higher visceral adiposity (78.3 +/- 6.9 vs. 60.3 +/- 6.9 cm(2), P = 0.017) and waist-to-hip ratio (0.91 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.86 +/- 0.02, P = 0.026) and lower HDL (1.0 +/- 0.03 vs. 1.16 +/- 0.06 mmol/l, P = 0.015) and triglyceride (1.2 +/- 0.04 vs. 1.4 +/- 0.06 mmol/l, P = 0.002) levels than MIR youth.

DESIGN: The study utilised an existing-groups design, with alcohol group: binge drinkers vs non-binge drinkers as the independent factor, and scores on the two PM memory subscales of the Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ) and the score on the Prospective Remembering Video Procedure (PRVP) as the dependent factors. Age, anxiety and depression scores, last alcohol use (in hours) and how many years spent drinking, were measured and analysed between the groups. SETTING: Each participant was tested in a laboratory setting. PARTICIPANTS: An opportunity sample of 21 'binge drinkers' (those drinking above 6 units for females and 8 units for males on 2 or more occasions per week) and 29 non-bingers were compared. MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported everyday PM lapses were measured using the PRMQ. The PRVP was used as an objective measure of PM. Alcohol and other drug use were assessed by the University of East London Recreational Drug Use Questionnaire. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale gauged self-reported levels of anxiety and depression. FINDINGS: After controlling for age, anxiety and depression scores, last alcohol use and how many years spent drinking, there were no significant between-group differences on either the self-reported long-term or short-term PM lapses.

Despite consistently positive results in the literature, the mechanisms of effect are unclear. On the grounds that chronic pain is associated with disruptions of brain-grounded maps of the body, a possible mechanism of yoga is to refine these brain-grounded maps. A left/right body part judgement task is an established way of interrogating these brain-grounded maps of the body. OBJECTIVE: To determine if people who do regular yoga practice perform better at a left/right judgement task than people who do not. METHODS: Previously collected, cross-sectional data were used. Using a case-control design, participants who reported taking part in regular yoga were selected against age, gender, neck pain and arm pain-matched controls. Participants viewed 40 photographs of a model with their head turned to the left or right, and were asked to judge the direction of neck rotation. They then completed a left/right-hand judgement task. RESULTS: Of the 1737 participants, 86 of them reported regularly taking part in yoga. From the remaining participants, 86 matched controls were randomly selected from all matched controls. There was no difference between Groups (yoga and no yoga) for either response time (p=0.109) or accuracy (p=0.964).

Whether the orientation of the tuning fork tines affects the amplitude of the sound signal at the ear in clinical practice has not been previously reported. The present study had two goals: determine if (1) there is clinician variability in tuning fork placement when presenting the air-conduction stimulus during the Rinne test; (2) the orientation of the tuning fork tines, parallel versus perpendicular to the EAC, affects the sound amplitude at the ear. METHODS: To assess the variability in performing the Rinne test, the Canadian Society of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery members were surveyed. The amplitudes of the sound delivered to the tympanic membrane with the activated tuning fork tines held in parallel, and perpendicular to, the longitudinal axis of the EAC were measured using a Knowles Electronics Mannequin for Acoustic Research (KEMAR) with the microphone of a sound level meter inserted in the pinna insert. RESULTS: 47.4 and 44.8% of 116 survey responders reported placing the fork parallel and perpendicular to the EAC respectively. The sound intensity (sound-pressure level) recorded at the tympanic membrane with the 512 Hz tuning fork tines in parallel with as opposed to perpendicular to the EAC was louder by 2.5 dB (95% CI: 1.35, 3.65 dB; p\u2009<\u20090.0001) for the fundamental frequency (512 Hz), and by 4.94 dB (95% CI: 3.10, 6.78 dB; p\u2009<\u20090.0001) for the second harmonic (1024 Hz).",

METHODS: According to the questionnaire of Karasek et al, job strain was divided into four modalities: (high strain, low strain, passive, and active) based on job demand (eg, the need to work hard and quickly) and job latitude (eg, control over skill use, time allocation, and organizational decisions) scores. High strain (HS) was defined by a high demand and a low job decision latitude. Individual data obtained in 926 (age 41 +/- 6 years) healthy normotensive or newly diagnosed hypertensive subjects were analyzed. Subjects participated in two prospective work site surveys designed to assess the influence of job strain on hypertension development. Relationships between job strain modalities and work site blood pressure (BP) levels were assessed using a general linear model. A complementary analysis using the the Pearson Phi coefficient (Z analysis) was implemented to explore nonlinear or scattered relationships between job strain and onset of hypertension. RESULTS: Systolic BP (SBP) was linearly related significantly to BMI and alcohol consumption, whereas diastolic BP (DBP) was related to age. The linear model did not find any relationship between SBP or DBP and job strain modalities. Using the Z analysis, development of systolic hypertension (SBP>140 mm Hg) was significantly associated with high job strain (P<.001).",

The purpose of this study was to examine the role of serial WBC counts in the diagnosis of a HVI. METHODS: After institutional review board approval, all injured patients admitted to a Level I trauma center from January 2003 to December 2007 with at least one WBC measurement were included in a retrospective analysis. The WBC profiles for patients with a HVI were compared against those without HVI. All WBC counts are reported as [x10(3)/microL]. RESULTS: The mean WBC count of the overall study population (n = 5,950) on admission was 11.6 +/- 5.3. Overall, 59.2% had an elevated WBC count on admission. A significant relationship between increasing Injury Severity Score and increasing WBC count on admission was found by linear regression. When comparing patients with HVI (n = 267) with patients without HVI (n = 5,683), no significant difference was found for admission WBC count. The highest WBC count within the first 24 hours for patients with HVI was 16.7 +/- 4.7. This was significantly higher than that for the 4,520 patients without any intraabdominal injury (13.0 +/- 5.2, adjusted p<0.001). Penetrating injury, a concomitant severe thoracic trauma (chest Abbreviated Injury Scale value>or=3), and highest WBC count>or=20.0 in the first 24 hours were independent risk factors for HVI. A maximal WBC count<or=12.5 in the first 24 hours was independently associated with a lower incidence of HVI.",

This paper examines whether this inequity still exists, taking into account ethnic differences in need. METHODS: Age-standardised time trends in intervention rates for coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) were calculated by ethnicity. Ethnic-specific trends were also calculated in the ratio of observed to expected CABG and PCI interventions based on the rate of hospitalisation with a diagnosis of STEMI. RESULTS: On a per capita basis, standardised CABG intervention rates were significantly higher for Pacific (both sexes) and female M\u0101ori than Other throughout 2000-2012, and were significantly higher for M\u0101ori males than Other in 2009-12. Population based PCI rates were significantly lower for male M\u0101ori from 2000-2012, while for female M\u0101ori they were significantly lower in 2000-2004 but significantly higher in 2009-12. However, and despite some improvement since 2000-2004, M\u0101ori and Pacific intervention numbers for PCI in 2009-2012 were still 22%-32% lower than expected for the rate of STEMI hospitalisation they experience.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate how patient-reported insomnia, in patients with chronic disabling occupational musculoskeletal disorders (CDOMDs), responds to a functional restoration program (FRP), and to investigate the relationships among insomnia, psychosocial factors, medication use, and post-FRP socioeconomic outcomes. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Insomnia is commonly reported by patients with chronic pain. METHODS: A consecutive sample of 262 patients with predominant chronic spinal pain was assessed with the insomnia severity index (ISI) at program admission and discharge. Groups were formed on the basis of the ISI total scores, from no clinically significant insomnia to severe clinical insomnia (SCI). Patient-reported psychosocial measures were administered, medication information was collected, and ISI discharge score categories were compared with 1-year post-FRP socioeconomic outcomes. The Wilcoxon signed rank, repeated measures ANOVAs, ANOVAs and \u03c7 tests were performed. RESULTS: The degree of clinical insomnia at admission significantly predicted program completion, P<0.001. Mean ISI scores improved from admission (M = 17.2) to discharge (M = 10.6, P<0.001), but a relatively high percentage of patients (36.6%) still reported moderate to severe insomnia symptoms at discharge. The prevalence of SCI decreased by 18.4%, but this remaining group still reported more pain, disability, and depressive symptoms, and demonstrated more use of opioids, sedatives, and antidepressants (P \u2264 0.01), compared with the group with no clinically significant insomnia.",

The objective of this study was to examine our experience with the use of a continuous intercostal nerve block (CINB). Although this technique is being used, little data have been published documenting its use and efficacy. We hypothesized that a CINB would provide excellent analgesia, improve pulmonary function, and decrease length of stay (LOS). METHODS: Consecutive adult blunt trauma patients with three or more unilateral rib fractures were prospectively studied over 24 months. The catheters were placed at the bedside in the extrathoracic, paravertebral location, and 0.2% ropivacaine was infused. Respiratory rate, preplacement (PRE) numeric pain scale (NPS) scores, and sustained maximal inspiration (SMI) lung volumes were determined at rest and after coughing. Parameters were repeated 60 minutes after catheter placement (POST). Hospital LOS comparison was made with historical controls using epidural analgesia. RESULTS: Over the study period, 102 patients met inclusion criteria. Mean age was 69 (21-96) years, mean injury severity score was 14 (9-16), and the mean number of rib fractures was 5.8 (3-10). Mean NPS improved significantly (PRE NPS at rest = 7.5 vs. POST NPS at rest = 2.6, p<0.05, PRE NPS after cough = 9.4, POST after cough = 3.6, p<0.05) which was associated with an increase in the SMI (PRE SMI = 0.4 L and POST SMI = 1.3 L, p<0.05). Respiratory rate decreased significantly (p<0.05) and only 1 patient required rescue analgesia.

We aimed to evaluate whether core length is a significant biopsy parameter in the detection of cancer, especially in the low risk cancer category group. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed pathology reports of 197 patients (2196 biopsy cores) undergoing initial transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy. A multivariate analysis of age, total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration, prostate gland volume, total number of cores and length of biopsy cores was performed. Secondary analyses included stratification by Gleason score. Single core analysis was done to calculate a workable cut off value for core length with optimal sensitivity and specificity in carcinoma detection. RESULTS: Mean age, PSA, prostate volume, and total number of cores were 66.9 years, 12.6 ng/mL, 47.2 cc and 11.1 cores, respectively. Whereas detection of cancer was significantly associated with advanced age (p<0.01) and smaller prostate volumes (p<0.001), PSA levels (p = 0.40) and number of cores (p = 0.20) were not significant predictive factors. Assessment of biopsy core lengths showed that cores harboring cancer (n = 307, average length 14.1 mm) were significantly longer than benign cores (n = 1889, average length = 13.2 mm) (p<0.001). Core length analysis yielded 13 mm cores have an optimal sensitivity (42.8%) and specificity (76.5%) for detection of carcinoma (odds ratio: 2.43).

Folic acid (FA) is often given as an adjunct to methotrexate therapy, but there is no conclusive proof that it decreases the toxicity of methotrexate and there is a theoretical risk that it may decrease the efficacy of methotrexate. OBJECTIVES: To look at the effect of stopping FA supplementation in UK rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients established on methotrexate<20 mg weekly and FA 5 mg daily, to report all toxicity (including absolute changes in haematological and liver enzyme indices) and to report changes in the efficacy of methotrexate. METHODS: In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 75 patients who were established on methotrexate<20 mg weekly and FA 5 mg daily were asked to stop their FA and were randomized to one of two groups: placebo or FA 5 mg daily. Patients were evaluated for treatment toxicity and efficacy before entry and then at intervals of 3 months for 1 yr.

The major limitation is early stent occlusion, making regular stent exchange necessary. OBJECTIVE: To date, no measures are available to prevent stent occlusion. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cleansing effect of shock wave application (SWA) on occluded pancreatic duct stents in vitro. DESIGN: In vitro study. PATIENTS: We analyzed occlusion rates of 25 plastic endoprostheses removed from 21 patients with chronic pancreatitis. INTERVENTION: We administered 350 shock wave pulses every 10 mm along the prosthesis, which was stored in a latex balloon filled with gas-free physiologic saline solution, by using a pressure of 42 megapascals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: After SWA, the occlusion rate was measured again, and the cleansing rate was calculated in comparison with the native prosthesis. RESULTS: The mean (\u00b1 SD) occlusion rate was significantly reduced (64.7 \u00b1 28.7 [15%-100%]) before SWA vs 9.8 \u00b1 25.3 [0-100%]) after SWA; P = .038).

RESULTS: A 96% response rate (24/25 centers) was achieved. Prophylaxis regimens varied from no prophylaxis to isoniazid 300\u00a0mg given life-long. The most common duration of treatment was 6\u00a0months post transplantation (at 7 centers). Variations existed in the concurrent use of pyridoxine. A wide discrepancy was seen in the determination of who should receive prophylaxis, with no clear association with frequency of TB incidence in the region.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Although women are at consistently greater risk for major depression (MD) than men, it is unclear whether sex modifies the aetiological impact of genetic factors on MD. Is the heritability of MD different in men and women? Do the same genetic risk factors predispose to MD in the two sexes? METHODS: We obtained a lifetime history of MD by personal interview on two occasions from 6672 individual twins and 2974 complete twin pairs. Three diagnostic criteria of increasing narrowness were employed: DSM-III-R, DSM-III-R plus impairment and Washington University. To increase power by controlling for unreliability of assessment, we evaluated sex differences on genetic risk for MD using a structural equation measurement model. RESULTS: Using DSM-III-R criteria, but not the two narrower definitions, heritability of MD was significantly greater in women than in men. In the three diagnostic systems, the genetic correlation in liability to MD in men and women was estimated at between +0.50 and +0.65. These estimates differed significantly from unity for the two broader definitions.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Predicting risk of premature death is one of the most basic tasks in medicine and public health, but has proven to be difficult over the long term even with the best prognostic models. One popular strategy has been to improve prognostic models with candidate genes and other novel biomarkers. However, the gains in predictive power have been modest and the costs have been high, leading to a demand for cost-effective alternatives. We conducted a proof-of-principle investigation to examine whether simple, cheap, and noninvasive paper-and-pencil measures of social class and personality phenotype could improve the performance of one of the most widely used prediction models for all-cause mortality, the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). METHODS: We used data from baseline and 25-year mortality follow-up of the UK Health and Lifestyle Study cohort. In a subset of the cohort, we first identified 5 psychosocial factors highly predictive of mortality: income, education, type A personality, communalism (preference for the company of others), and \"lie\" scale (a measure of denial, putatively associated with ill health). We then examined the predictive performance of the CCI with and without these measures in a validation subsample. RESULTS: Across 5-, 10-, 15-, 20-, and 25-year time horizons, the psychosocially augmented CCI showed substantially better discrimination [area under the receiver-operating curves (95% confidence interval) from 0.83 (0.81-0.85) to 0.84 (0.83-0.86)] than the CCI [area under the receiver-operating curves from 0.74 (0.71-0.76) to 0.77 (0.76-0.79)]. The psychosocially augmented CCI also showed substantially better calibration [standardized discrimination ratios from 0.83 (0.81-0.86) to 0.85 (0.84-0.87)].",

In that regard, circulating endothelial cells (CECs) and cytokeratins (CKs) seem to reflect their roles in both tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell death. METHODS: Patients with advanced, previously untreated non-small-cell lung cancer were randomly assigned to an endostatin treatment group (paclitaxel + carboplatin + endostatin) and a control group (paclitaxel + carboplatin + placebo). A total of 122 patients were evaluated, of whom 107 had measurements of blood CECs, CK8, caspase-cleaved CK18 (ccCK18), and uncleaved CK18 (CK18) before and at weeks 3 and 6 of treatment, respectively. RESULTS: Higher baseline CECs in patients with a tumor response (partial remission + stable disease, p = 0.002 for the entire group; p = 0.000 for the treatment group) were observed. The number of CECs decreased significantly after endostatin treatment (p = 0.000), whereas CK levels increased. Increased levels of ccCK18 and CK18, but not CK8, reached significance (p = 0.001 and p = 0.048, respectively) when compared with the baseline. Tumor response showed a strong correlation with reduction of CECs (p = 0.000) and increase of ccCK18 (p = 0.040) after endostatin therapy. CECs and ccCK18 were independent predictors of survival (p = 0.000 and p = 0.000, respectively).",

METHODS: We conducted an observational study that included all maternity units in metropolitan France. Using the sample from the National Perinatal Survey 2003, we included 5393 women who met the criteria of a low risk pregnancy. The odds ratios (OR) corresponding to ECS and LCS were calculated for various characteristics for the women, fetus and maternity units, using a multinomial logistic regression model. For each factor, the adjusted OR corresponding to ECS and LCS were compared using the Wald's test. RESULTS: The rates of ECS and LCS in our population were 2.9% and 4.3%, respectively. Maternal age>or=30 years, body mass index>or=25 kg/m(2), primiparity and nationality from an African country were associated with an increased risk for both ECS and LCS.

SUBJECTS AND METHOD: A stratified random sample of 2,032 Chinese subjects (990 male, 1,033 female) mean age (s.d.) 80.1 (7.5), interviewed and examined at baseline and after 36 months. Deaths and presence of diabetes mellitus and hypertension were documented. A younger data set of 1,010 subjects (500 male, 510 female), mean age (s.d.) 45.5 (11.6), was used for comparison of the BMI-WC relationship between younger and older subjects. In predicting outcomes using different values of BMI, WC and WHR, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to derive cut-off values with optimal sensitivity and specificity, and the likelihood ratios for mortality, diabetes and hypertension for different anthropometric values were plotted.

METHODS: One hundred and eighty patients with knee osteoarthritis were enrolled as per the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines. Visual analog scale (VAS) for knee pain and the knee-specific Western Ontario Mac University (WOMAC) index for pain, stiffness, and disability were recorded. Five additional radiological features apart from those in the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) classification grading system were recorded by two authors who were blinded to the clinical diagnosis. The variables significantly associated were analyzed by linear regression model. RESULTS: Pain was significantly associated with increasing KL grades; physical function was nearly significant and stiffness was not. On analysis of individual radiological features, WOMAC pain was significant with subchondral sclerosis, joint space width, and tibiofemoral alignment although the correlation was week. VAS pain was significant with the latter two and with articular incongruity. Functional disability was associated with medial joint-space narrowing, tibiofemoral alignment, loose bodies, and juxta-articular osteopenia.

We wished to characterize depressive symptoms and determine the accuracy of two common screening instruments for major and minor depression in a population of old-old retirees. METHODS: Participants lived independently in one of two Continuing Care Retirement Communities and volunteered for an in-home interview about cancer screening attitudes. As part of this baseline interview, they were screened with the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale. Those agreeing to a second interview received an evaluation using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-IV), performed by a geriatric psychiatrist within two weeks of the initial interview. RESULTS: In an educated and cognitively intact group of retirees averaging 80 years of age, the GDS and CES-D performed poorly using standard cutpoints in detecting both major (sensitivity 60% for both) and minor (sensitivity 33% and 50%, respectively) depression. One in five participants had significant depression as confirmed by SCID-IV evaluation. Twelve percent had major depression and 7% had minor depression. Most participants had their first episode of either after age 60.",

Our aim was to determine (1) whether existing models stratify patients into groups by risk and (2) which model best predicts the rate of SSO and SSI. METHODS: Patients who underwent open VHR and were followed for at least 1\u00a0mo were included. Using two data sets-a retrospective multicenter database (Ventral Hernia Outcomes Collaborative) and a single-center prospective database (Prospective)-each patient was assigned a predicted risk with each of the following models: Ventral Hernia Risk Score (VHRS), Ventral Hernia Working Group (VHWG), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wound Class, and Hernia Wound Risk Assessment Tool (HW-RAT). Patients in the Prospective database were also assigned a predicted risk from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (area under the curve [AUC]) were compared to assess the predictive accuracy of the models for SSO and SSI. Pearson's chi-square was used to determine which models were able to risk-stratify patients into groups with significantly differing rates of actual SSO and SSI. RESULTS: The Ventral Hernia Outcomes Collaborative database (n\u00a0=\u00a0795) had an overall SSO and SSI rate of 23% and 17%, respectively. The AUCs were low for SSO (0.56, 0.54, 0.52, and 0.60) and SSI (0.55, 0.53, 0.50, and 0.58). The VHRS (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and VHWG (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) models were able to risk-stratify patients into groups with significantly different rates of SSO and SSI.",

        "input": "UNLABELLED: We analyzed 420 kidney retransplants at the University of Minnesota, 87 of which did and 333 which did not share HLA mismatches with the previous transplant. There was no difference in outcome. We conclude that exceptions to routine HLA matching policies do not have to be made for kidney retransplants. OBJECTIVE: To determine if the kidney graft functional survival rate for retransplants is influenced by presence of HLA mismatches in common with the previous (failed) transplant. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Kidney retransplants have a lower function rate than primary grafts. An anamnestic response to HLA antigens shared with the previous donor could be one factor responsible, but reports in the literature are conflicting. METHODS: Of 420 kidney retransplants with HLA information done at the University of Minnesota, 87 shared>or = 1 HLA antigens specifically mismatched with the previous donor (63 cadaver and 24 living donor retransplants), while 333 did not (247 cadaver, 86 living donor). Patient and graft survival rates were calculated by life-table analysis for recipients with vs. without repeat mismatches, with the significance of differences determined by the Lee-Desu statistic. RESULTS: Patient and kidney graft retransplant survival rate curves were not significantly different (p>or = 0.41) for those exposed or not exposed to the same HLA mismatches as before. At 2 years, 70% vs. 61%, respectively, of cadaver grafts and 71% vs. 78%, respectively, of living donor grafts were functioning.",

We hypothesize that given equivalent lung volumes, the degree of respiratory insufficiency will be comparable regardless of the etiology. METHODS: Records of all fetuses with CDH, omphalocele, and CLM between January 2000 and June 2013 were reviewed. MRI-based observed-to-expected total fetal lung volumes (O/E-TFLV) were calculated. An analysis of outcomes in patients with O/E-TFLV between 40% and 60%, the most inclusive range, was performed. RESULTS: 285 patients were evaluated (161, CDH; 24, omphalocele; 100, CLM). Fetuses with CDH had the smallest mean O/E-TFLV. CDH patients were intubated for longer and had a higher incidence of pulmonary hypertension. Fifty-six patients with the three diagnoses had an O/E-TFLV of 40%-60%. The need for ECMO, supplemental oxygen at 30days of life, and 6-month mortality were similar among groups.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Growing Up Today Study (GUTS) participants were offspring of women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II. In the present study, 15,253 girls and boys (aged 9-14 years in 1996) were included. Maternal diabetes and weight status and infant feeding were obtained by maternal self-report. We defined maternal overweight as BMI>or = 25 kg/m2. Childhood obesity, from self-reported height and weight, was based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definitions as normal, at risk for overweight, or overweight. Maternal status categories were nondiabetes/normal weight, nondiabetes/overweight, or diabetes. Logistic regression models used generalized estimating equations to account for nonindependence between siblings. RESULTS: For all subjects combined, breast-feeding was associated with reduced overweight (compared with normal weight) in childhood. Compared with exclusive use of formula, the odds ratio (OR) for exclusive breast-feeding was 0.66 (95% CI 0.53-0.82), adjusted for age, sex, and Tanner stage.

Young people spend much of their time within the school environment, but the influence of school context (school connectedness, ethos and contextual factors such as school size or denomination) on suicide-risk is understudied. Our aim is to explore if school context is associated with rates of attempted suicide and suicide-risk at age 15 and self-harm at age 19, adjusting for confounders. METHODS: A longitudinal school-based survey of 1698 young people surveyed when aged 11, (primary school), 15 (secondary school) and in early adulthood (age 19). Participants provided data about attempted suicide and suicide-risk at age 15 and deliberate self-harm at 19. In addition, data were collected about mental health at age 11, social background (gender, religion, etc.), and at age 15, perception of local area (e.g. neighbourhood cohesion, safety/civility and facilities), school connectedness (school engagement, involvement, etc.) and school context (size, denomination, etc.). A dummy variable was created indicating a religious 'mismatch', where pupils held a different faith from their school denomination. Data were analysed using multilevel logistic regression. RESULTS: After adjustment for confounders, pupils attempted suicide, suicide-risk and self-harm were all more likely among pupils with low school engagement (15-18% increase in odds for each SD change in engagement). While holding Catholic religious beliefs was protective, attending a Catholic school was a risk factor for suicidal behaviours. This pattern was explained by religious 'mismatch': pupils of a different religion from their school denomination were more likely to report low school engagement.",

We hypothesized that a closed unit, in which a unit-based intensivist directly provides and coordinates care on all cases, has improved mortality and utilization compared with an open unit, in which individual attendings and consultants provide care, while intensivists serve as supervising consultants. METHODS: We undertook the retrospective study of outcomes in 2 intensive care units (ICUs)-a traditional open unit managed by faculty intensivists and a second closed unit overseen by the same faculty intensivists who coordinated the care on all patients in a large community hospital. PRIMARY OUTCOME: In-hospital mortality. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, and relative costs of hospitalization. RESULTS: From January 2006 to December 2007, we identified 2602 consecutive admissions to the 2 medical ICUs. Of all patients admitted to the closed and open units, 19.2% and 24.7%, respectively, did not survive (P<0.001, adjusted for severity). Median hospital LOS was 10 days for the closed unit and 12 days for the open unit (P<0.001). Median ICU LOS was 2.2 days for the closed unit and 2.4 days for the open unit (P = NS).

The study aim was to determine whether nasal packing after lateral osteotomies in rhinoplasty surgery increases the risk of periorbital ecchymosis post-operatively. METHODS: This was a prospective self-controlled single-blinded study. Seventy four patients who underwent rhinoplasty with bilateral lateral osteotomies by a single surgeon were enrolled in the study. Nasal cavity packing for one side was done while the other side was left unpacked. Periorbital ecchymosis was evaluated by the operating surgeon and a separate surgeon who is unaware of the packing side separately on the first, fourth and seventh day post-operatively. A 4-grade scale was utilized to assess the ecchymosis with grade 4 being the most severe. RESULTS: Nasal packing was found to significantly increase the severity and duration of periorbital ecchymosis post rhinoplasty. While no difference was observed between the packed and unpacked sides on the first post-operative day, significant difference was noted on the 4th day (mean score 2.36 and 1.15 for the packed and unpacked sides, respectively) and on the 7th day after surgery in favor of the unpacked side (score 1.24 and 0.61 for the packed and unpacked sides, respectively).",

Recently, the percutaneous pedicle screw fixation (PPSF) systems have been introduced in spinal surgery; and it has become a popularly used method for the treatment of degenerative spinal disease. However, there are few clinical reports concerning the efficacy of PPSF without fusion in treatment of TLBF. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of short-segment PPSF without fusion in comparison to open short-segment pedicle screw fixation with bony fusion in treatment of TLBF. METHODS: This study included 59 patients, who underwent either percutaneous (n = 32) or open (n = 27) short-segment pedicle screw fixation for stabilization of TLBF between December 2003 and October 2009. Radiographs were obtained before surgery, immediately after surgery, and at the final follow-up for assessment of the restoration of the spinal column. For radiologic parameters, Cobb angle, vertebral wedge angle, and vertebral body compression ratio were assessed on a lateral thoracolumbar radiograph. For patient's pain and functional assessment, the visual analogue scale (VAS), the Frankel grading system, and Low Back Outcome Score (LBOS) were measured. Operation time, and the amount of intraoperative bleeding loss were also evaluated. FINDINGS: In both groups, regional kyphosis (Cobb angle) showed significant improvement immediately after surgery, which was maintained until the last follow up, compared with preoperative regional kyphosis. Postoperative correction loss showed no significant difference between the two groups at the final follow-up. In the PPSF group, the amount of intraoperative bleeding loss was significantly less than that in the open group. The amount of intraoperative bleeding loss was not correlated with the amount of postoperative correction loss.",

We set out to evaluate how critical care is delivered in Level I and II trauma centers and the extent to which these centers implement evidence-based patient care practices known to improve outcome. METHODS: All Level I and Level II trauma centers in the United States were surveyed using a previously validated questionnaire pertaining to the organizational characteristics of critical care units. Questions identifying the impediments to the implementation of an intensivist model of critical care delivery were added to the original survey. An intensivist model intensive care unit (ICU) was defined as one meeting all of the following criteria: a) the physician director was board certified in critical care; b)>50% of physicians responsible for care were board certified in critical care; c) an intensivist made daily rounds on the patients; and d) an intensive care team had the authority to write orders on the patients. The survey respondents were also queried regarding the extent to which they complied with evidence-based guidelines for care in the ICU. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 65% (295 centers). Only 61% of Level I centers and 22% of Level II centers provided an intensivist model of critical care delivery. Sixty-nine percent of centers had a form of collaborative care with an intensivist, but few centers had dedicated intensivists without responsibilities outside the ICU. The most common reason cited for not involving an intensivist in the delivery of critical care services was a concern regarding a loss of continuity of care. There was limited implementation of evidence-based practices in the ICU; the model of critical care delivery had no effect on rates of implementation of these practices.",

It has been suggested that adipose tissue metabolism could be related to the risk of post-operative infection, but this could be partially related to the body-mass index. The aim of this study was to look for a relation between adipocytokine levels and the risk of post-operative infection and its type. METHODS: This prospective cohort study was conducted between March 2013 and March 2014 in two French teaching hospitals. Pre-operative plasma levels of adiponectin and leptin were measured in consecutive patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. All infections in the 30 d following surgery were recorded. RESULTS: Among the 142 patients included, 29 (20.4%) presented a post-operative infection: 26 surgical site infections and three extra-abdominal infections. Adiponectin and leptin levels correlated weakly but substantially with the body mass index (rspearman=-0.26 and +0.31, respectively). While there was no substantial difference between patients with and those without post-operative infection for adiponectin, median pre-operative leptin was substantially greater in patients with post-operative infection (8.67 vs. 4.37\u2009ng/mL, p=0.003). A substantial interaction was found between leptin and cancer. In patients operated on for cancer, the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was lower than in patients with benign diseases (0.597 vs. 0.858, p=0.011).

Furthermore, diagnostic reliability of the delineation of selected enteric pathologies was noted. CT data were assigned into groups: oncology, inflammation, vascular, pathology, trauma and gastrointestinal pathology. RESULTS: Delineation of the bowel was clearly practicable across all segments irrespective of the type of enteric contrast, though a slight impairment was observed without enteric contrast. Although delineation of intestinal pathologies was mostly classified \"clearly delimitable\" more difficulties occurred without oral contrast (neutral/positive/no contrast, 0.8 %/3.8 %/6.5 %).

With increasing use of bedside technology, however, autopsy rates have steadily declined. OBJECTIVE: To identify (1) trends in pediatric autopsy rates during the past decade, (2) concordance between antemortem and postmortem diagnoses, and (3) patient characteristics influencing autopsy rates or diagnostic yield. METHODS: All pediatric deaths between January 1, 1984, and December 31, 1993, were retrospectively reviewed. Data collection included demographics for all patients, and length of stay, diagnostic imaging studies, antemortem diagnoses, and autopsy findings for patients with autopsies. Autopsy diagnoses were compared with antemortem findings and classified according to their concordance. RESULTS: Of 297 pediatric deaths, autopsies were performed on 107 patients (36%). Autopsy rates did not change significantly during the study period. Autopsies were not associated with patient gender, race, or insurance status, but increased significantly with age. Autopsies were performed in 26% of infants 12 months or younger, 60% of children between 13 to 60 months of age, and 100% of children 61 months or older (chi2; P<.001). In 34% of cases, new diagnoses were made at autopsy, including 7 cases where new findings, if known before death, would likely have resulted in a change in treatment or improved survival.

Two different brands of marketed alkaline water (with a pH of 8.8 or higher) were also studied, tested for acidity and described. METHODS: A pilot in-vitro study was conducted to determine the pH levels of a convenience sample of popular brands of bottled water, tap water and other known acidic beverages in comparison with the pH values reported on the respective manufacturers' website. Each beverage was tested in a laboratory using a calibrated Corning pH meter model 240, and waters were compared to the corresponding company's testified pH value. Waters were also compared and contrasted based on their process of purification. The data was then compiled and analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: The pH values for the tested beverages and bottled waters were found to be predominantly acidic. Ten out of the 14 beverages tested were acidic (pH<7), 2 municipal (or \"tap\") waters were neutral (pH=7) and 2 bottled waters were alkaline (pH>7).

We used a classification algorithm called logic regression to search for clinically useful tests combining total and percent free PSA and receiver operating characteristic analysis and compared these tests with those based on total and complexed PSA. Data were divided into training and test subsets. For robustness, we considered 35 test-train splits of the original data and computed receiver operating characteristic curves for each test data set. RESULTS: The average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve across test data sets was 0.74 for total PSA and 0.76 for the combination tests. Combination tests with higher sensitivity and specificity than PSA>4.0 ng/mL were identified 29 out of 35 times. All these tests extended the PSA reflex range to below 4.0 ng/mL.

        "input": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical impact of D-dimer (DD) as a tumor marker in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). The prognostic value of preoperative DD measurement was assessed in relation to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. METHODS: DD and CEA levels were measured preoperatively in 199 patients who underwent resection for CRC and the results were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: The preoperative mean (\u00b1 SD) levels of DD and CEA were 347.5 (\u00b1 940.1) ng/mL and 106.4 (\u00b1 1099.2) ng/mL. The DD level was significantly correlated with the nature of surgery (emergency vs. elective; p=0.002), presence of residual tumor (R1-2 vs R0; p=0.037), and tumor diameter (p<0.001). Conversely, DD was not correlated with tumor grade, pT, pN and M stages, and stage according to the Dukes classification. The 5-year survival rates were 80% and 64% for patients with negative and positive DD values, respectively (p=0.156). CEA was significantly related to all major prognostic factors (resection category, pT, pN and M stages as well as Dukes stage). A significantly worse prognosis was observed for patients with positive CEA levels. Multivariate analysis confirmed CEA as an independent prognostic factor (p=0.005), whilst DD was not (p=0.796).",

Both groups were analyzed for gestational age, gender, race, Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes, birth weight, cardiopulmonary resuscitation before venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, age at the start of treatment, duration of treatment, worst arterial blood gas sample preceding treatment, activated clotting time values, need for platelet transfusions, mean blood pressure, and the use of inotropics and steroids before the treatment. For both groups, total number and volume of intravascular infusions of normal saline, pasteurized plasma protein solution, erythrocytes, and platelets during the first 24 hours of treatment were determined. Variables were analyzed in their relationship to intracranial hemorrhage by using univariate and multivariate conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: The only statistically significant difference in patient characteristics between the case patients and control subjects was arterial blood gas values. Newborns who developed intracranial hemorrhage during the treatment received both a statistically significantly higher number and a statistically significantly higher total volume of intravascular volume administrations compared with control patients.

We hypothesized that a substantial proportion of patients with adult-onset MMD were misclassified as having ICAS, which may in part explain the high prevalence of intracranial atherosclerotic stroke in Asians. METHOD: We analyzed 352 consecutive patients with ischemic events within the MCA distribution and relevant intracranial arterial stenosis, but no demonstrable carotid or cardiac embolism sources. Conventional angiography was performed in 249 (70.7%) patients, and the remains underwent MRA. The occurrence of the c.14429G>A (p.Arg4810Lys) variant in ring finger protein 213 (RNF213) was analyzed. This gene was recently identified as a susceptibility gene for MMD in East Asians. RESULTS: The p.Arg4810Lys variant was observed in half of patients with intracranial stenosis (176 of 352, 50.0%), in no healthy control subjects (n = 51), and in 3.2% of stroke control subjects (4 of 124 patients with other etiologies). The presence of basal collaterals, bilateral involvement on angiography, and absence of diabetes were independently associated with the presence of the RNF213 variant. Among 131 patients who met all three diagnostic criteria and were diagnosed with MMD, three-fourths (75.6%) had this variant.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the efficacy of wearing compression stockings to prevent muscle damage and to maintain running performance during a marathon competition. BACKGROUND: Exercise-induced muscle damage has been identified as one of the main causes of the progressive decrease in running and muscular performance found during marathon races. METHODS: Thirty-four experienced runners were pair-matched for age, anthropometric data, and best race time in the marathon, and randomly assigned to a control group (n = 17) of runners who wore conventional socks or to a group of runners who wore foot-to-knee graduated compression stockings (n = 17). Before and after the race, a sample of venous blood was obtained, and jump height and leg muscle power were measured during a countermovement jump. Serum myoglobin and creatine kinase concentrations were determined as blood markers of muscle fiber damage. RESULTS: Total race time was not different between the control group and the compression stockings group (210 \u00b1 23 and 214 \u00b1 22 minutes, respectively; P = .58).

METHODS: Twenty-two healthy participants aged 21 to 52 who reported consuming alcohol on 1 to 4\u00a0days per week were recruited from the community. The final study sample included 11 men and 8 women. Both TAC and BrAC were monitored while each participant drank 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 beers in the laboratory on 5 separate days. In contrast to previous studies, a self-paced alcohol administration procedure was used. RESULTS: While there was considerable variation in the times it took to consume each beer, key TAC parameters were not affected by pace of drinking.

Agrotis ipsilon multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AgipMNPV) is highly infective to young black cutworms, Agrotis ipsilon, but too slow-acting against late instars for effective curative control on golf courses or sports fields. Chitin-synthesis-inhibiting fungicides containing the active ingredient polyoxin-d are used to control fungal diseases in turfgrass, and similar compounds have been shown in the laboratory to synergize baculoviruses by disrupting peritrophic membrane function. This study tested whether applying the virus together with such a fungicide can synergize AgipMNPV activity against A. ipsilon in turfgrass. RESULTS: The addition of a chitin synthesis inhibitor failed to increase AgipMNPV infectivity to A. ipsilon in the field. Rather, delayed and slightly reduced mortality from viral infection was seen when larvae fed on fungicide/virus-treated grasses as opposed to virus-only treatments. Choice tests revealed the fungicide residues to be a mild feeding deterrent.",

METHODS: A qualitative design based on semistructured interviews and focus groups was used to explore how decision makers belonging to different health sectors implement resource allocation decisions. RESULTS: Informants were mostly unaware of EE. The most important criteria mentioned to adopt a treatment were evidence of effectiveness, social/stakeholder demand, or resource availability. Despite general positive attitudes about EE, knowledge was rather limited. Although cost considerations were widely accepted by purchasers and managers, clinicians argued about these issues as interfering with the doctor-patient relationship. Other important perceived barriers to HTA use were lack of confidence in the transferability of studies conducted in developed countries and institutional fragmentation of the Argentine healthcare system.

OBJECTIVE: This cross-sectional study examined the associations among aerobic capacity, lower limb muscle strength, and cognitive functions in persons with mild, moderate, and severe MS disability. METHODS: The sample included 62 persons with mild (n = 20), moderate (n = 21), and severe (n = 21) MS disability. The participants underwent neuropsychological assessments of cognitive processing speed (CPS; Symbol Digit Modalities Test [SDMT]), verbal memory (California Verbal Learning Test-2 [CVLT-2]), and visual memory (Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised [BVMT-R]). All participants further underwent testing for measuring aerobic capacity (ie, peak oxygen consumption) and muscular strength (ie, peak torque of knee flexors and extensors). RESULTS: Aerobic capacity and muscular strength outcomes were associated with SDMT (r = .35-.41), but not CVLT-2 or BVMT-R (r<.19) scores in the overall sample. Aerobic capacity (r = .42) and knee flexor peak torque (r = .39) were associated with SDMT scores in persons with mild disability, but not in those with moderate (r<.06) and severe (r<.14) disability.",

In two large prospective cohorts, the Black Women's Health Study (BWHS) and the Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII), we investigated whether reproductive factors explain the difference. METHODS: During 1,582,083 person-years of follow-up of 140,914 women observed from 1995 to 2007, 327 ER+ breast cancers were identified among black women in BWHS and NHSII and 1,179 among white women in NHSII. Cox proportional hazards regression models, stratified by race and pooled, were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for the association of race, parity, age at first birth, and lactation in relation to risk of ER+ cancer with adjustment for age and other breast cancer risk factors. RESULTS: Age at first birth differed markedly in the two groups, with 66 % of parous black women having their first child before age 25 as compared with 36 % of white women. Each additional year of age at first birth was associated with a 4 % increased risk of ER+ breast cancer among both racial groups. Relative to nulliparous women, parous women were at decreased risk of ER+ breast cancer (HR 0.59, 95 % CI 0.20, 1.77), in black women and (HR 0.63, 95 % CI 0.45, 0.87) in white women. The HR for the association of black race with ER+ cancer was 0.67 (95 % CI 0.53, 0.84) in a model that adjusted for age at first birth and lactation.",

The nonunion rate and early complication rate following laterally based locked plating in this specific fracture are not well described. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study conducted at three affiliated tertiary care hospitals to evaluate nonunion, early post operative complications, discharge disposition, length of stay, and mortality in patients over 60 years old undergoing laterally based locked plating of a low energy distal femur fracture. RESULTS: Forty-four out of 176 patients were deceased at one year (25%). Predictors of one year mortality included older age, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and delay to surgery greater than 2days (p<0.001). Of 99 patients alive and with follow up at one year, 24 (24%) developed a nonunion and 21 of 24 required nonunion surgery. Development of a surgical site infection was statistically significantly correlated with development of nonunion. Age and CCI did not predict development of nonunion.

However, these two aspects of partnership history have rarely been considered jointly in models of mental health. This study aims to investigate how the time since the most recent union dissolution and the number of union dissolutions are related to two indicators of psychological well-being-life satisfaction and the General Health Questionnaire-among middle-aged solo-living British men and women. METHODS: Data from the United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study from 2009 to 2010 are analysed for 1201 50-64 year olds who were living alone and have ever been in a co-resident union (472 men and 729 women). Logistic regression analysis is used to investigate how life satisfaction and General Health Questionnaire 12 (GHQ-12) caseness are associated with partnership characteristics. RESULTS: GHQ-12 caseness is significantly and positively associated with the number of union dissolutions and negatively with the duration since the most recent union dissolution.

We undertook the present study to investigate the risk of radiation pneumonitis (RP) in the setting of BPT and to determine the need for delay or omission of radiation therapy (RT) in these patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We identified 123 HL patients treated with ABVD (Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) followed by RT to the chest from January 2009 to December 2014. The medical records were reviewed for clinical, pathologic, and treatment information and toxicities. Our primary outcome was RP of any grade. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the association of BPT, baseline patient characteristics, and treatment variables with the incidence of RP. RESULTS: A total of 123 patients were included, of whom 99 (80%) received consolidation intensity modulated RT after ABVD treatment. We identified 31 patients (25.2%) with BPT after frontline ABVD. Seventeen patients (13.8%) developed RP a median of 8\u00a0weeks (range 1-39) after RT completion. BPT did not correlate with the risk of developing RP (P=.36). We evaluated the RP outcomes with respect to the bleomycin to RT interval (\u22646\u00a0weeks vs>6\u00a0weeks), and we found that this interval did not predict for RP risk (P=.60). Dosimetric parameters such as the volume covered by 5\u00a0Gy and the mean lung dose were analyzed.

        "input": "PURPOSE: Small renal tumors detected incidentally are considered to have less aggressive potential. This assumption is mainly based on the low tendency to increase in size on serial imaging studies, but histopathological parameters of progression in larger patient series are scant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed data of 287 tumor bearing kidneys in which solid tumors 4 cm or less in diameter were detected by cross-sectional imaging and subsequently removed surgically. Tumor size as documented by preoperative computerized tomography was correlated to histological diagnosis, and in cases of malignancy correlated to tumor type, pathological TNM stage and nuclear (Fuhrman) grade. With multifocal lesions the largest single tumor was considered the reference lesion but multifocality was also considered a separate parameter. RESULTS: At a mean tumor diameter of 2.94 +/- 0.87 cm 65 (22.6%) tumors were 2 cm or less, 103 (35.9%) were 2.1 to 3.0 cm and 119 (41.5%) were 3.1 to 4 cm in diameter. A total of 56 (19.5%) tumors were benign with no correlation to tumor size (Pearson test p = 0.660). Renal cell cancer was found in 227 (79.1%) patients with 159 (70.0%) clear cell, 47 (20.7%) papillary, 11 (4.8%) chromophobe and 10 others with no correlation to tumor diameter.

The effect of subsequent cigarettes on HR is less than that associated with the first cigarette of the day, an indication of tachyphylaxis (acute tolerance). To date, smoking/HR studies have not been conducted double-blind. Instead, control conditions have included non-smoking or some type of \"sham\" smoking (puffing on an unlit cigarette or a straw). OBJECTIVE: We investigated the HR response to smoking and its time course using double-blind methodology. METHODS: HR was recorded in overnight-abstaining participants before and after smoking the first, second and third cigarette of the day (40 min between each cigarette) in two sessions. The experimental manipulation involved replacing the second cigarette of one session with a very low nicotine-yield cigarette (0.05 mg; FTC method) compared with the other five cigarettes (1.1-mg nicotine yield). RESULTS: Smoking increased HR by 15, 8 and 7 beats/min (bpm) in the session where all three cigarettes had the higher yield. The comparable values for the session in which the second cigarette had the lower yield were 15, -1 and 11 bpm.",

In the present study we explored the usefulness of applying a comprehensive motivational theory (Goal orientations), for this purpose. According to goal orientation theory, learning motivation is defined as the general goals students pursue during learning (either mastery goals - gaining new knowledge; or performance goals - gaining a positive evaluation of competence or avoiding negative evaluation). Perceived psychosocial abilities are a desirable outcome, and low frustration tolerance (LFT), is a negative feature of student behavior. The hypothesis was that the mastery goal would be positively associated with psychosocial abilities while performance goals would be positively associated with LFT. METHODS: 143 first-year medical students completed at the end of an annual doctor-patient communication course a structured questionnaire that included measures of learning goal orientations (assessed by Pattern of Adaptive Learning Scale - PALS), psychosocial abilities (assessed by Psychological Medicine Inventory- student version -PMI-S) and Low Frustration Tolerance (LFT). RESULTS: All study variables were found reliable (Cronbach's \u03b1 ranged from .66 to .90) and normally distributed. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis revealed significant associations supporting the hypotheses. The mastery goal orientation was positively associated with perceived psychosocial abilities (PMI-S) (\u03b2 = .16, p<.05) and negatively associated with low frustration tolerance (\u03b2 = -.22, p<.05) while performance goal orientation was significantly associated with low frustration tolerance (\u03b2 = .36, p<.001).",

METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-five consecutive patients (age 59 +/- 10, 31 males) referred for coronary angiography were examined by contrast-enhanced RT3DE. Wall motion analysis was performed off-line by dedicated software. New or worsening wall motion abnormalities were detected in 17 of 28 patients with significant CAD (sensitivity 61%), and in two of 17 patients without significant CAD (specificity 88%). The sensitivity for detection of single-vessel CAD was 8/15 patients (53%), for two-vessel CAD 4/6 (67%), and for three-vessel CAD 5/7 (71%). In 35 patients, comparison with conventional RT3DE was available. The image quality index at rest improved from 2.5 +/- 1.2 to 3.2 +/- 1.0 (P<0.001) with contrast and at peak stress from 2.3 +/- 1.2 to 3.1 +/- 1.0 (P<0.001).

        "input": "OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to identify issues in diabetes self-management in an Australian Maltese community with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and to identify opportunities for community pharmacies to offer self-management support to these populations. METHODS: Individual, semi-structured interviews were conducted. A maximum variation sample was recruited from La Vallette Social Centre, Sydney, and interviewed by the investigator. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and iteratively coded into themes by constant comparison using computer software. Cultural predictors of adherence were analysed. KEY FINDINGS: Twenty-four participants were interviewed. Themes included diabetes knowledge, self-management behaviours, cultural predictors of adherence and interest in community pharmacy disease management services. Diabetes knowledge was generally limited. Although most participants practised some self-monitoring of blood glucose they lacked knowledge of practice recommendations. Participants generally undertook regular physical activity, though adherence to diet varied according to social influences. Cultural influences on perceptions included attitudes to practitioners, treatment and peer experiences. Enablers included attitudes towards financial independence and social integration while nurturers included family and community support. Participants expressed interest in accessing more support from their community pharmacy due to ease of access and interest in learning more about diabetes.",

This study was made to confirm that mortality was higher in Aquitaine patients than in the rest of France, and to determine its causes. DESIGN: All the cases reported between January 1982 and June 2005 were included. Cox's proportional hazard models were used to determine the relative risk (RR) of death among patients living in Aquitaine. Two periods were considered to take into account the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in 1996. RESULTS: Since 1982, 60,212 AIDS patients were reported. After adjustment on the main patient features, the risk of death was significantly higher in AIDS patients living in Aquitaine than in other regions (RR=1.12; IC95%=[1.06-1.18]) before the introduction of HAART. After 1996, this difference did not persist, and an opposite trend was even observed (RR=0.90; IC95%=[0.75-1.09]).",

Locust bean gum and its blends with either xanthan or carrageenan were used to adjust viscosity levels (20, 40, and 70 mPa s). The ranges of viscosity and sweetness level were selected to represent a typical concentration range in commercially available beverages. RESULTS: An increase in viscosity resulted in significant increases in pulpiness, sliminess and perceived viscosity (P-values \u2264 0.001), which were not dependent on sweeteners or hydrocolloid type. Taste perception remained largely unchanged irrespective of the hydrocolloid used.",

These include changes in G-protein-mediated signaling and subsequent modification of gene expression via transcription factors such as cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). METHODS: We investigated levels of CREB in lymphoblasts from patients with BD, all responders to lithium prophylaxis (n = 13), and healthy control subjects (n = 15). Phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) was measured by immunoblotting in subjects with BD (n = 15) as well as in their affected (n = 17) and unaffected (n = 18) relatives, and healthy controls (n = 16). RESULTS: Basal CREB levels were comparable in patients and control subjects and were not changed by lithium treatment. pCREB levels were increased in both patients and their relatives compared to controls (p = 0.003). Forskolin stimulation led to a 24% increase in pCREB levels in cells from healthy subjects (p = 0.002) but not in the other three groups.

The RAPT was developed and tested on a population of Australian patients undergoing joint replacement, but its validity in other populations is unknown. A low RAPT score is reported to indicate a high risk of needing any form of inpatient rehabilitation after TJA, including short-term nursing facilities.QUESTIONS/ PURPOSES: This study attempts (1) to assess predictive accuracy of the RAPT on US patients undergoing total hip and knee arthroplasty (THA/TKA); and (2) to determine predictive accuracy of each individual score (1-12). METHODS: Between June 2006 and December 2011, RAPT scores of 3213 patients (1449 THAs; 1764 TKAs) were prospectively captured during the preoperative clinical visit.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the preoperative status of the adjacent discs, as determined by provocative discography, has an impact on the clinical outcome of lumbar fusion in chronic low back pain (LBP) patients. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The results of lumbar fusion in chronic LBP patients vary considerably and are hard to predict. It is believed that degenerative levels adjacent to a fused spinal segment may be a cause of continuing pain. In this respect, it is important to know whether preoperative degenerative or symptomatic adjacent levels have an adverse effect on patient outcomes after lumbar fusion. METHODS: In 197 patients with an equivocal indication for lumbar fusion (two thirds were patients with prior spine surgery), the decision for either lumbar fusion or conservative management was determined by a temporary external transpedicular fixation trial. During the diagnostic workup, all patients had undergone provocative discography that included the assessment of the discs adjacent to the intended fusion levels. The individual changes in pain on a visual analog scale, assessed before treatment and at follow-up, and patient satisfaction were the measures of outcome. RESULTS: In the 82 patients who underwent a lumbar fusion, no difference in outcome was found between those patients with degenerative or symptomatic discs adjacent to the fusion and those with normal adjacent discs.",

Therefore, a quantitative structure-activity relation (QSAR) analysis was performed to study the relation between structural parameters and the effect of the following VPA metabolites: 4-en-VPA, 2-en-VPA, 3-en-VPA, 2,4'-dien-VPA, 4,4'-dien-VPA, 4-hydroxy-VPA, 3-ceto-VPA, 3-hydroxy-VPA, 5-hydroxy-VPA, and propylglutaric acid. METHODS: By using the CAChe program package for biomolecules (Oxford Molecular, Ltd), we performed molecular modeling. The anticonvulsant activity determined on the threshold for maximal electroconvulsions in mice was obtained from a study of L\u00f6scher and Nau. Structural parameters were compared between metabolites with a double bond and metabolites with oxygen at either side chain (unpaired Student's t test). A single linear regression analysis between each structural parameter and the relative anticonvulsant potency was also performed. RESULTS: Similar parameters were found between the cis and trans and R and S isomers. Biologic activity and most of the structural parameters were significantly different between metabolites with a double bond and metabolites with oxygen at either side chain. Activity was directly related to log P(oct) (r(2) = 0.77) and to reactivity parameters and was inversely related to stability parameters and to molecular weight and surface. The most potent metabolites had a log P(oct) value of higher than 2 units.",

Purpose of the present study is to analyze the role of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in diagnosing and planning the treatment of atrophic nonunions in the upper and lower extremity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study examined retrospectively the SPECT/CT scans of 10 patients (mean age = 44.5 \u00b1 16.5 years, 9 males/1 female, 4 tibia/4 femur/1 radius/1 fibula) who underwent surgical exploration for suspected avital pseudarthrosis. Surgical and histopathological findings were compared with the radiologists' findings to assess the sensitivity and specificity of SPECT in diagnosing avital nonunions. The average interval from the osteosynthesis until their SPECT scan was 18 months. All surgical findings have been documented electronically in the hospital computer system. Results of the radiologist's reading were then compared with surgical exploration and histopathological findings and specifity and sensitivity was calculated. RESULTS: There were 4 vital and 6 nonvital pseudarthroses. SPECT scans identified all the vital pseudarthroses and 3 of the 6 nonvital pseudarthroses. The sensitivity of SPECT in diagnosing non-vital atrophic nonunions is 50% and the specifity 100%.",

Increased anti-HLA antibody production is associated with early transplant rejection, transplant coronary artery disease (CAD), and decreased post-transplant survival rates. We asked whether bridging to transplantation with an LVAD increases the risk of transplant CAD. METHODS: We reviewed data for all adults (>18 years old) who underwent heart transplantation at our institution between 1988 and 2000. After exclusion of transplant recipients who survived<3 years, we divided the remaining cohort into 2 groups: those bridged to transplantation with LVADs (mean duration of support, 149 +/- 107 days, n = 29) and those in United Network for Organ Sharing Status 1 bridged to transplantation without LVADs (controls, n = 86). We compared groups in terms of disease cause, age, sex, donor age, panel-reactive antibody testing, crossmatching, pre- and post-transplant cholesterol concentrations, diagnosis of diabetes mellitus or treated hypertension, infections, calcium channel blocker use, transplant rejection, ischemic time, cytomegalovirus infection, pre-transplant transfusion, and incidence of transplant CAD (defined as any coronary lesion identified by coronary angiography).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cohort of 102 patients with 149 replants (6 extremities, 143 digits) and a mean age of 41 years (range 5 to 72 years) was enrolled in this study. The data collected included age, gender, tobacco/cigarettes use, trauma mechanism, underlying disease (e.g., hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), etc.), and vein graft use. An analysis with a multivariable regression was conducted to identify the risk factors of replant failure and their respective odds ratios (ORs). RESULTS: Multilevel generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) with a binomial distribution and logit link showed that smoking did not increase the risk of replant failure (p = 0.234). In addition, the survival of replants was not affected by DM or HTN (p = 0.285 and 0.938, respectively). However, the replantation results were significantly affected by the age of the patients and the mechanism of injury.

The growth pattern, interface with parenchyma, presence of a scar and segmental inversion enhancement, unenhanced CT histogram, and pattern and degree of enhancement on triphasic MDCT images were independently evaluated by two radiologists. Biopsy and pathology reports were used as the reference standard, and imaging follow-up of benign lesions was performed for at least 1 year. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the significance of CT criteria in differentiating malignant from benign lesions. RESULTS: Of the 99 lesions, 74 (75%) were malignant at biopsy, and 25 (25%) were benign. Lesions with gradual enhancement were more likely to be benign.

METHODS: Eligible children were first-time patients of clinics participating in the Longitudinal Assessment of Manic Symptoms who were between ages six and 12 and who were English speaking. Children who screened positive for symptoms of mania (N=1,124) were invited to participate, and families of 621 (55%) children consented. A matched sample of 86 children without a positive screen for mania also participated. Baseline interviews assessed sociodemographic characteristics of the child and family and the child's functioning, diagnoses, and use of services. RESULTS: Of the 707 children, 30% were younger, and 50% used multiple types of specialty outpatient services. Younger children were more likely to be male, have Medicaid insurance, and have two parents with mental health problems. Use of multiple types of services was related to study site, high depression scores, fewer minor health issues, and fewer stressful life events among younger children and with parental stress, primary diagnosis, poor functioning, and not living with both parents among older children. Younger children were much more likely than older children to have used services before age six.",

Possible relationships between TE diversity (and not just abundance) and genome size have not been investigated to date, though there are reasons to expect either a positive or a negative correlation. This study compares data from 257 species of animals, plants, fungi, and \"protists\" to determine whether TE diversity at the superfamily level is related to genome size. RESULTS: No simple relationship was found between TE diversity and genome size. There is no significant correlation across all eukaryotes, but there is a positive correlation for genomes below 500 Mbp and a negative correlation among land plants. No relationships were found across animals or within vertebrates.

One may question, therefore, the routine use of postchemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RLND), especially if the residual masses are less than 20 mm in diameter. To define the role of such surgery, we analyzed the postchemotherapy histology in testicular cancer patients with minimal residual disease.

The authors recently proposed that certain pharmacodynamic characteristics (IR50, the steady-state infusion rate to maintain 50% twitch depression; keo, the rate constant for equilibration between plasma concentration and effect; and gamma, the Hill factor describing sigmoidicity of the concentration-effect relation) could be estimated without plasma concentration data. Here estimates for IR50, keo, and gamma determined with and without plasma concentration data are compared. METHODS: Six volunteers were given 15-60 micrograms/kg vecuronium on each of two occasions during anesthesia with propofol. Mechanical responses to train-of-four stimulation were measured at the adductor pollicis and at the laryngeal adductors. Various pharmacokinetic models accounting for the presence and potency of vecuronium's 3-desacetyl metabolite and a sigmoid e-max pharmacodynamic model were fit to the resulting plasma concentration and effect (adductor pollicis and laryngeal adductors) data to determine IR50 keo, and gamma for each effect. One model related dose to effect without plasma concentration data. RESULTS: Values for IR50(adductor pollicis), IR50(laryngeal adductors), gamma (adductor pollicis), and gamma (laryngeal adductors) were similar when determined with and without plasma concentration values.

DESIGN: A retrospective analysis and a prospective study. SETTING: St George Hospital, Sydney, a teaching hospital of the University of New South Wales delivering 2500 women per year. POPULATION: Eight hundred and forty-five women with new hypertension in the second half of pregnancy, managed by a uniform protocol (661 in the retrospective analysis, 184 in the prospective study). METHODS: Clinical and laboratory data at initial presentation were compared among women with GH who developed PE and those who remained with a diagnosis of GH until delivery. Data predictive for progression from GH to PE were analysed by logistic regression analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURED: Progression from GH to PE. RESULTS: In the retrospective analysis, 416 women initially presented as having GH and 62 (15%) progressed to PE. In the prospective study, 112 women initially presented with GH and 29 (26%) progressed to PE, giving an overall progression of 17%. In both studies, women who developed PE from GH presented earlier than those who remained with GH until delivery. In multiple logistic regression analyses prior miscarriage and early gestation at presentation were associated with increased likelihood of progressing from GH to PE.",

In Sweden, the Medical Products Agency (MPA) keeps a voluntary reporting system for such adverse reactions. However, the reporting is sparse, consisting almost only of cases with test-proven allergic contact dermatitis, thus under-reporting the more common irritant reactions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to try to improve the reporting system. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Dermatologists at 3 dermatology departments used a structured protocol during the clinical investigation of 151 consecutive patients reporting skin reactions to cosmetics. The protocol included symptoms, signs, affected body site, suspected products, and final diagnosis after patch testing. Based on clinical data and patch test results, a causality assessment for each product was made according to a protocol used at the MPA. RESULTS: Allergic contact dermatitis was found in 28% of the patients, and irritant reactions were equally common at 27%.",
        "output": "The reporting system for adverse reactions to cosmetics needs to be improved. The use of a structured protocol for the clinical investigation of patients reporting skin reactions to cosmetics, and the use of a causality assessment protocol for the MPA, will improve the quality of the reports and the information given to the MPA."

OBJECTIVE: To compare the physical and mental benefits of an exercise-based yoga practice to that of a more comprehensive yoga practice (one with an ethical/spiritual component). DESIGN: Students with mild to moderate depression, anxiety, or stress and who agreed to participate were assigned to one of three groups: integrated yoga, yoga as exercise, control. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 81 undergraduate students 18 years and older at a university in the southeastern United States participated in the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Depression, anxiety, stress, hope, and salivary cortisol. RESULTS: Over time, participants in both the integrated and exercise yoga groups experienced decreased depression and stress, an increased sense of hopefulness, and increased flexibility compared to the control group. However, only the integrated yoga group experienced decreased anxiety-related symptoms and decreased salivary cortisol from the beginning to the end of the study.",

METHODS: Six group interviews were conducted with 17 patients with knee OA. Discussion topics included first impressions about using colour to describe pain, whether participants could associate their pain with colour, how colours related to changes to intensity and different pain qualities, and whether they could envisage using colour to describe pain to healthcare professionals. RESULTS: The group interviews indicated that, although the idea of using colour was generally acceptable, it did not suit all participants as a way of describing their pain. The majority of participants chose red to describe high-intensity pain; the reasons given were because red symbolized inflammation, fire, anger and the stop signal in a traffic light system. Colours used to describe the absence of pain were chosen because of their association with positive emotional feelings, such as purity, calmness and happiness. A range of colours was chosen to represent changes in pain intensity. Aching pain was consistently identified as being associated with colours such as grey or black, whereas sharp pain was described using a wider selection of colours. The majority of participants thought that they would be able to use colour to describe their pain to healthcare professionals, although issues around the interpretability and standardization of colour were raised.",

METHODS: Site, type of abnormality and background pattern seen on the diagnostic mammograms of 63 women with bilateral breast carcinoma were compared. The histological type and grade of all the carcinomas were verified by histological review. RESULTS: There was a tendency for the contralateral tumour to have similar mammographic features to those of the initial tumour. In patients in whom the first carcinoma was visible purely as a mass, the contralateral carcinoma had a similar appearance in 82% (P<0.001). When the original tumour showed mammographic calcification the contralateral tumour did so in 65% (P<0.001). Normal mammography or calcification alone were seen almost exclusively in women with a dense background pattern (100% and 92% respectively) while masses and calcification with masses were seen in women with dense and fatty patterns (58% and 35% dense respectively). When the mammographic site of the contralateral tumour was compared with that of the first tumour no significant correlation could be demonstrated. There was a significant trend for contralateral carcinomas to be of the same histological grade (P<0.005) but not histological type.",

METHODS: The validity of published International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, coding algorithms for identifying patients with particular chronic pain syndromes in the RAMQ database was tested using pain specialist-established diagnostic data of 561 patients enrolled in the Quebec Pain Registry, which was used as the reference standard. Modified versions of these algorithms (i.e., adaptation of the number of healthcare encounters) were also tested. For each algorithm, sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive values, and their respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated. RESULTS: In the RAMQ database, some previously published algorithms and modified versions of these algorithms were found to be valid for identifying patients suffering from chronic lumbar pain (sensitivity: 0.65, 95%CI: 0.59-0.71; specificity: 0.83, 95%CI: 0.79-0.87), chronic back pain (sensitivity: 0.70, 95%CI: 0.64-0.76; specificity: 0.73, 95%CI: 0.68-0.78), and chronic neck/back pain (sensitivity: 0.71, 95%CI: 0.65-0.76; specificity: 0.78, 95%CI: 0.72-0.82).

The literature suggests that offering some degree of human support to website users may boost usage and outcomes. OBJECTIVE: We disseminated the POWeR (\"Positive Online Weight Reduction\") Web-based weight management intervention in a community setting. POWeR consisted of weekly online sessions that emphasized self-monitoring, goal-setting, and cognitive/behavioral strategies. Our primary outcome was intervention usage and we investigated whether this was enhanced by the addition of brief telephone coaching. We also explored group differences in short-term self-reported weight loss. METHODS: Participants were recruited using a range of methods including targeted mailouts, advertisements in the local press, notices on organizational websites, and social media. A total of 786 adults were randomized at an individual level through an online procedure to (1) POWeR only (n=264), (2) POWeR plus coaching (n=247), or (3) a waiting list control group (n=275). Those in the POWeR plus coaching arm were contacted at approximately 7 and 28 days after randomization for short coaching telephone calls aimed at promoting continued usage of the website. Website usage was tracked automatically. Weight was assessed by online self-report. RESULTS: Of the 511 participants allocated to the two intervention groups, the median number of POWeR sessions completed was just one (IQR 0-2 for POWeR only, IQR 0-3 for POWeR plus coach). Nonetheless, a substantial minority completed at least the core three sessions of POWeR: 47 participants (17.8%, 47/264) in the POWeR-only arm and 64 participants (25.2%, 64/247) in the POWeR plus coaching arm. There were no significant differences in weight loss between the two intervention groups at 12 weeks.",

The study aimed to document the prevalence of MG-related fatigue in ethnic Norwegians and to examine whether MG severity is associated with symptoms of autonomic disturbance, which in turn is associated with fatigue and functional disability. METHODS: Eighty two of the 97 who fulfilled the study inclusion criteria participated in the study. Controls were 410 age- and sex-matched subjects drawn from a normative sample (n = 2136) representative of the Norwegian population. Bivariate analyses and multivariate linear regression analyses were used to assess associations between questionnaire-reported MG severity, symptoms of autonomic disturbance, fatigue (mental and physical) and functional disability. RESULTS: Forty-four per cent (36/82) of patients fulfilled the criteria for fatigue compared with 22% (90/410) of controls (odds ratio 2.0; p = 0.003). Twenty-one per cent of patients (17/82) met the criteria for chronic fatigue versus 12% (48/410) of controls (odds ratio 1.96; p = 0.03). MG patients had higher total fatigue scores than controls (p<0.001) and a high prevalence of autonomic symptoms, especially poor thermoregulation and sleep disturbance.

Surveys of patients suggest, however, that few healthcare providers follow the USPSTF recommendation on physical activity counseling. METHOD: This article examined data on the rate of healthcare provider counseling, compliance with recommendations and the blood pressure difference associated with following recommendations to increase physical activity. Data are from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey III 1988-1994 (NHANES-III) of adults with hypertension. We compared the results of compliance with recommendation from the NHANES-III data to five recent clinical trials on physical activity conducted between 1991 and 2001. RESULTS: A third of the NHANES-III hypertensive patients received counseling to engage in physical activity to manage their hypertension, and 71% (n=669) followed the recommendations and had a systolic blood pressure that was an average of approximately equal to 3-4 mm Hg lower than those who did not follow recommendations.",

Functioning islet cell tumors (FIT) elaborate a variety of hormones, producing dramatic symptoms, while the initial presentation of non-functioning islet cell tumors (NIT) is commonly an abdominal mass or symptom complex related to invasion of adjacent structures. As a result, NIT are purported to present at a later stage, with lower resectability rates, and an overall poorer prognosis, when compared to FIT. In addition, a number of reports have indicated that the incidence of NIT has increased significantly in recent years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight patients were studied retrospectively. All had islet cell tumors of the pancreas and were seen at the University of Nebraska Medical Center and affiliated Nebraska Methodist Hospital during a 19-year period. RESULTS: There were 9 patients (32%) in the NIT group and 19 (68%) in the FIT group. The mean ages at presentation were 61 years for the NIT and 52 years for the FIT group. In the NIT group, all presented with either abdominal pain (n = 7) or jaundice (n = 2). In contrast, over 90% of the patients with FIT had symptoms referable to the specific hormone elaborated by the tumor. Primary tumor size for NIT was 4.1 +/- 0.7 cm versus 5.0 +/- 0.6 cm for the FIT group. No significant difference was found for NIT versus FIT with respect to the incidence of metastatic disease at presentation (44% versus 53%), resectability rate with curative intent (44% versus 53%), or disease-free survival at 2 years (67% versus 40%).",

The acute phase occurs early and is associated with an inflammatory process and neutrophil infiltration into the synovium. The second chronic phase is related to effector T-cell activation and the dysregulation of macrophage function. Creation of an immunomodulatory environment has been attributed to apoptotic cells themselves, apoptotic cell uptake by phagocytes as well as a less sensibility of phagocytes capturing apoptotic bodies to activation. Therefore we evaluated the potential of apoptotic cell injection to influence the course of inflammation in SCW-induced arthritis in rats. METHODS: Rat apoptotic thymocytes were injected intraperitoneally (2 x 108) in addition to an arthritogenic dose of systemic SCW in LEW female rats. Control rats received SCW immunization and PBS. Rats were then followed for arthritis occurrence and circulating cytokine detection. At sacrifice, regulatory T cells (Tregs) and macrophages were analyzed. RESULTS: Apoptotic cell injection profoundly suppressed joint swelling and destruction typically observed during the acute and chronic phases of SCW-induced arthritis. Synovial inflammatory cell infiltration and bone destruction were also markedly suppressed. Ex vivo experiments revealed reduced levels of TNF in cultures of macrophages from rats challenged with SCW in the presence of apoptotic thymocytes as well as reduced macrophage response to lipopolysaccharide. Moreover, apoptotic cell injection induced higher Foxp3+ Tregs in the spleen and synovium.",

Diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) has been reported to detect early ischemic damage (cytotoxic edema) as bright areas of high signal intensity and vasogenic edema as areas of heterogeneous signal intensity. We report various DWI findings in 2 patients with hyperglycemic HCHB. OBJECTIVES: To describe the DWI and gradient echo findings and characterize the types of edema in HCHB associated with hyperglycemia. SETTING: A tertiary referral center neurology department. DESIGN AND METHODS: Two patients with HCHB associated with hyperglycemia underwent DWI, gradient echo imaging, and conventional MR imaging with gadolinium enhancement. The patients had an elevated serum glucose level on admission and a long history of uncontrolled diabetes, and the symptoms were controlled by dopamine receptor blocking agents. Initial DWIs were obtained 5 to 20 days after symptom onset. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were measured in the abnormal lesions with visual inspection of DWI and T2-weighted echo planar images. RESULTS: T1- and T2-weighted MR images and brain computed tomographic scans showed high signal intensities in the right head of the caudate nucleus and the putamen. Gradient echo images were normal. The DWIs showed bright high signal intensity in the corresponding lesions (patient 1), and the ADC values were decreased (0.79 \u00d7 10(-3) mm2/sec).

A confidence level scoring system was used, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated. Histologic findings were standard of reference. Difference in performance of T2-weighted and combined T2-weighted plus gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted sequences was analyzed by comparing corresponding areas under ROC curves (A(z)) for each observer. Interobserver agreement was calculated by using linear weighted kappa statistics. RESULTS: Addition of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted to T2-weighted MR imaging did not significantly improve diagnostic accuracy for prediction of tumor penetration through rectal wall (A(z) of T2-weighted vs T2-weighted plus T1-weighted images for observer 1, 0.740 vs 0.764; observer 2, 0.856 vs 0.768) and tumor extension into mesorectal fascia (A(z) for observer 1, 0.962 vs 0.902; observer 2, 0.962 vs 0.902). Interobserver agreement was excellent for prediction of tumor penetration through rectal wall (kappa of 0.880 and 0.892) and tumor extension into mesorectal fascia (kappa of 0.902 and 0.902).",

The prevalence of pulmonary embolism (PE) at autopsy in lung-transplant recipients has not been characterized previously. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the prevalence of PE, infection, and acute and chronic rejection at autopsy and their respective contributions to death in lung-transplant recipients according to survival posttransplantation. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 126 autopsy reports performed in lung-and heart-lung-transplant recipients between June 1990 and September 2002. RESULTS: PE was identified at autopsy in 34 (27.0%) of 126 lung- and heart-lung-transplant recipients. The prevalence of autopsy-established PE was highest, at 36.4%, in the early group (1-30 days) compared with 20.0% and 23.8% in the intermediate (31-365 days) and late (>365 days) groups, respectively. Although fungal and viral pneumonia were noted most frequently in the early and intermediate groups, bacterial pneumonia was noted in 32% to 45% of autopsies over the posttransplant period. Acute cellular rejection and bronchiolitis obliterans were present in 29.5% and 2.3%, 40.0% and 17.5%, and 35.7% and 42.9% of patients in the early, intermediate, and late groups, respectively. The most frequent cause of death was bacterial infection.",

It is unclear whether the current subtyping of ASD into autistic disorder and Asperger disorder is neurobiologically valid. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a quantitative meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry studies exploring gray matter volume abnormalities in ASD, to examine potential neurobiological differences among ASD subtypes, and to create an online database to facilitate replication and further analyses by other researchers. DATA SOURCES: We retrieved studies from PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge databases between June 3, 1999, the date of the first voxel-based morphometry study in ASD, and October 31, 2010. Studies were also retrieved from reference lists and review articles. We contacted authors soliciting additional data. STUDY SELECTION: Twenty-four data sets met inclusion criteria, comprising 496 participants with ASD and 471 healthy control individuals. DATA EXTRACTION: Peak coordinates of clusters of regional gray matter differences between participants with ASD and controls, as well as demographic, clinical, and methodologic variables, were extracted from each study or obtained from the authors. DATA SYNTHESIS: No differences in overall gray matter volume were found between participants with ASD and healthy controls. Participants with ASD were found to have robust decreases of gray matter volume in the bilateral amygdala-hippocampus complex and the bilateral precuneus. A small increase of gray matter volume in the middle-inferior frontal gyrus was also found. No significant differences in overall or regional gray matter volumes were found between autistic disorder and Asperger disorder.

This single center study aims to investigate the value of these indices to predict complications in a cohort of patients treated with laparoscopic cryoablation (LCA) for cT1 renal mass. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Single institution data from consecutive LCA procedures were prospectively collected from December 2006 to April 2013. Renal mass anatomical complexity was categorized according to RENAL and PADUA indices. Comorbidity was assessed by the Charlson-index. Intraoperative complications (IOCs) were reviewed and categorized: blood loss>100\u2009mL, conversion, tumor fracture, and incomplete ablation. Postoperative complications (POCs) were graded using the modified Clavien-index. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models addressed the risk for complications. RESULTS: Ninety-nine LCA procedures were included. The median RENAL-score was 7.0 (standard deviation [SD] 1.7), and the median PADUA-score was 8.0 (SD 1.6). IOC occurred in 19 procedures (19%).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 459 men treated with RP with pathological Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer in the SEARCH database. The men were stratified into five groups based on pathological characteristics: group 1, men with negative surgical margins (NSMs) and no ECE; group 2, men with positive surgical margin (PSMs) and no ECE; group 3, men with NSMs and ECE; group 4, men with PSMs and ECE; and group 5, men with SVI. Cox proportional hazards models and the log-rank test were used to compare BCR among the groups. RESULTS: At 2 years after RP, pathological group was significantly correlated with BCR (log-rank, P<0.001) with patients in group 5 (+SVI) having the highest BCR risk (66%) and those in group 1 (NSMs and no ECE) having the lowest risk (14%).

METHODS: SDRA focuses on individual time and diameter responses, taking into account the fluctuation in baseline diameter, providing improved insight into reaction patterns when compared with established methods as delivered by retinal vessel analyzer (RVA) software. SDRA patterns were developed with measurements from 78 healthy nonsmokers and subsequently validated in a group of 21 otherwise healthy smokers. Fundus photography and retinal vessel responses were assessed by RVA, intraocular pressure by contact tonometry, and blood pressure by sphygmomanometry. RESULTS: Compared with the RVA software method, SDRA demonstrated a marked difference in retinal vessel responses to flickering light (P<0.05). As a validation of that finding, SDRA showed a strong relation between baseline retinal vessel diameter and subsequent dilatory response in both healthy subjects and smokers (P = 0.001). The RVA software was unable to detect this difference or to find a difference in retinal vessel arteriovenous ratio between smokers and nonsmokers (P = 0.243). However, SDRA revealed that smokers' vessels showed both an increased level of arterial baseline diameter fluctuation before flicker stimulation (P = 0.005) and an increased stiffness of retinal arterioles (P = 0.035) compared with those in nonsmokers.

Liver biopsies were evaluated for fibrosis, qualitatively, by Ishak score and quantitatively by fibrosis area fraction (FAF) using digital image analysis (morphometry). LSM was correlated with fibrosis and other studied variables using spearman correlation. A stepwise multiple regression analysis was also performed to examine independent factors associated with LSM. Different cut-off values of LSM were calculated for predicting individual fibrosis stages using receiver-operating characteristic curve. Cut-off values with optimal clinical performance (optimal sensitivity and specificity simultaneously) were selected. RESULTS: The majority of HCV group had minimal activity (80%) and no/mild fibrosis (72%). On the other hand, the majority of AIH group had mild to moderate activity (70%) and moderate to severe fibrosis (95%) and all Wilson disease group had mild to moderate activity (100%) and moderate to severe fibrosis (100%).

        "input": "BACKGROUND: This prospective study examined the appropriate use of colonoscopy in an open-access system with the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines and determined whether the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines were associated with relevant endoscopic findings. METHODS: In a cohort of 2221 consecutive patients referred for colonoscopy, the proportion of patients who underwent colonoscopy for appropriate indications was prospectively assessed. The relationship between appropriateness and the presence of clinically relevant endoscopic diagnoses was assessed by calculating (1) the positive and negative likelihood ratio of the indications; and (2) the change in the probability of relevant endoscopic diagnoses in the presence of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy criteria. RESULTS: The rate for 'generally not indicated' colonoscopies was 37%. Relevant endoscopic diagnoses were present in 28.5% of cases with American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy indications versus 20.1% of patients without appropriate indications. However, the risk of finding relevant diagnoses was significantly increased by American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy criteria application (odds ratio (OR) 1.58; 99% CI 1.20-2.07; p<0.01). Furthermore, in both endoscopic situations (appropriate and not appropriate), the likelihood ratio, positive and negative, varied very little, suggesting a low predictivity for serious pathologies by the appropriate procedure.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Many approaches have been considered to reduce heart failure (HF) readmissions. The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations (JC) requires hospitals to provide patients admitted for HF with discharge instructions that address 6 topics related to HF management: diet, exercise, weight monitoring, worsening symptoms, medications, and follow-up appointments. These guidelines were developed based on expert opinion, but no one has tested whether patients' understanding of these instructions affects 30-day readmission rates. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of patients admitted for decompensated HF. Patients completed an understanding survey immediately after their nurse read their discharge papers. The survey contained 1 question for each of the 6 JC topics. Of the 145 patients in the study, only 14 (10%) understood all 6 discharge instructions. Patients with complete comprehension of their discharge instructions were significantly less likely to be readmitted within 30 days than those with nonperfect understanding (P\u00a0= .044), but this association was no longer significant after controlling for level of education and use of English as a primary language.",

METHODS: All the African cases detected in Barcelona between 1989 and 2007 were investigated in a retrospective analysis. Clinical-epidemiological variables such as sex, age, visiting friends and relatives (VFR), species, hospital admission and chemo-prophylaxis were compared. Data were analysed by logistic regression, calculating the Odds Ratio (OR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: Of the 489 African patients, 279 (57,1%) had been born in EG and 210 (42,9%) in the rest of Africa. The cumulative incidence of imported malaria among those from EG was 179.6 per thousand inhabitants, while in those from the RA it was 33.7 per thousand (p<0.001). Compliance with chemoprophylaxis (CP) was very low, but there were no differences between the two groups. Comparing those from EG to those from RA, the former were characterized by having more patients in the visiting friends and relatives (VFR) category, and more individuals younger than 15 years or older than 37 years, and more women.

RESULTS: Overall, 16.1% of older adults reported meeting strength training guidelines. For each of nine functional limitations, those with the limitation were less likely to meet strength training recommendations than those without the limitation. For example, 20.0% of those who reported no difficulty walking one-quarter mile met strength training guidelines, versus only 10.1% of those who reported difficulty (p<.001). In sum, 21.7% of those with no limitations (33.7% of sample) met strength training guidelines, versus only 15.9% of those reporting 1-4 limitations (38.5% of sample) and 9.8% of those reporting 5-9 limitations (27.8% of sample) (p<.001).",

Lifetime smoking exposure was represented by the comprehensive smoking index (CSI), which combines the duration, intensity and time since cessation of smoking habits. The analysis was conducted among the ever smokers. All of the models were adjusted for age, department (a regional administrative unit), education and occupational exposures. RESULTS: Overall, we found that the lung cancer risk was similar among men and women.

If urodynamic investigations were to be valuable in the diagnostic work-up, patients with normal and abnormal findings would have different treatment results. Our policy to never combine prolapse surgery and stress-incontinence surgery allowed us to study whether incontinence after surgery can be predicted from urodynamic investigation results. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in consecutive patients undergoing vaginal prolapse surgery (anterior colporraphy and/or posterior colporraphy, and/or vaginal hysterectomy) between 2002 and 2004. All patients underwent pre-operative urodynamic investigation, including filling cystometry, urethral pressure profile measurement, and free flow cystometry.

RESULTS: We studied 76 patients, of whom 5 (7%) patients reported stress-incontinence and 5 (7%) patients reported urge-incontinence after surgery. Findings at urodynamic investigation could not predict the presence of stress- or urge-incontinence after surgery. Likelihood ratios (LR) of prior presence of urge and stress-incontinence for the presence of post-operative urge- and stress-incontinence were 4.5 and 1.2, respectively.

Of those patients with L5 NRC, only 22 (22.4%) recorded any hits on the L5 dermatome on the front, and only 60 (61.2%) on the back with only 13 (13.3%) on both. Only 1 (1.0%) patient placed more than 50% of their hits within the L5 dermatome. Of those patients with S1 NRC, only 3 (3.6%) recorded any hits on the S1 dermatome on the front, and only 64 (77.1%) on the back with only 15 (18.1%) on both. No patients placed more than 50% of their hits within the S1 dermatome. Regarding pins and needles, 27 (29.7%) patients with L5 NRC recorded hits on the front alone, 27 (29.7%) on the back alone, and 14 (15.4%) on both. Nineteen (20.9%) recorded more than 50% of hits within the L5 dermatome. Three (3.6%) patients with S1 NRC recorded hits on the front alone, 44 (53.0%) on the back alone, and 18 (21.4%) on both.

        "input": "PURPOSE: The most widely accepted classification for endometriosis is the Revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine (rASRM) system, but this does not take deeply infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) into account. The Enzian classification enables clinicians to classify DIE. Due to complexity and partial overlap with rASRM, it was revised for a second time in February 2011. Using both the systems to classify lesions would be inappropriate, as they refer to different locations. The aim of this study was to analyze whether the revised Enzian classification is easier to use and avoids duplicate classifications. METHODS: Retrospective study of 460 women admitted for endometriosis. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-seven of 460 patients (41\u00a0%) had histologically confirmed DIE based on the revised Enzian classification. Further classification of these 187 patients using Enzian revealed 270 retroperitoneal lesions, as some patients had several DIE-type lesions simultaneously: 66 in compartment A (rectovaginal septum, vagina), 112 in compartment B (sacrouterine ligaments, pelvic wall), 58 in compartment C (bowel), 15 with adenomyosis uteri, 7 with bladder involvement, 8 with intrinsic involvement of the ureter, and 4 with bowel involvement. All 270 lesions were classified using Enzian alone and not with the rASRM score. There were no duplicate classifications (rASRM and Enzian).",

        "input": "INTRODUCTION: Studies investigating genetic risk factors for susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) studied anti-citrullinated peptide antibody (CCP)-positive RA more frequently than anti-CCP-negative RA. One of the reasons for this is the perception that anti-CCP-negative RA may include patients that fulfilled criteria for RA but belong to a wide range of diagnoses. We aimed to evaluate the validity of this notion and explored whether clinical subphenotypes can be discerned within anti-CCP-negative RA. METHODS: The 318 patients with anti-CCP-negative RA (1987 ACR criteria), included in the Leiden Early Arthritis Clinic between 1993 and 2006, were studied for baseline characteristics and radiologic progression data during a mean follow-up of 5 years. Grouping was studied both at variable and patient levels. Principal components analysis and partial least-squares regression were applied to study for clustering of variables. A cluster analysis was performed to look for clustering of patients. RESULTS: The simultaneous presence of patient characteristics at disease presentation was observed for several groups; however, the three largest groups of patients' characteristics explained only 26.5% of the total variance. Plotting the contribution of each patient to these three groups did not reveal clustering of patients. Comparable observations were made when data on progression of joint destruction were studied in relation to baseline clinical data. A cluster analysis, evaluating whether patients resemble each other, revealed no grouping of patients. Altogether, no clinically distinguishable subphenotypes were observed.",

The authors of this report used a US population-based database to determine survival outcomes of patients who underwent surgery. METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry was used to identify patients who were diagnosed with L-SCLC between 1988 and 2002 coded by SEER as localized disease (T1-T2Nx-N0) or regional disease (T3-T4Nx-N0). Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to compare overall survival (OS) for all patients. RESULTS: In total, 14,179 patients were identified, including 863 patients who underwent surgical resection. Surgery was associated more commonly with T1/T2 disease (P<.001). Surgery was associated with improved survival for both localized disease and regional disease with improvements in median survival from 15 months to 42 months (P<.001) and from 12 months to 22 months (P<.001), respectively. Lobectomy was associated with the best outcome (P<.001). Patients with localized disease who underwent lobectomy with had a median survival of 65 months and a 5-year OS rate of 52.6%; whereas patients who had regional disease had a median survival of 25 months and a 5-year OS rate of 31.8%. On multivariate analysis, the benefit of surgery varied in a time-dependant fashion. However, the benefit of lobectomy remained across all time intervals (P = .001).",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: The objectives of this prospective trial were to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and predictive value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to use MRI evaluation under general anesthesia (EGA) 6 to 8 weeks after chemoradiation to determine local control. METHODS: Eighty-two consecutive patients with advanced-stage squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or supraglottic larynx were treated with selective targeted chemoradiation. All patients who completed treatment and survived had a minimum follow-up of 3 years. MRI and EGA were performed from 6 to 8 weeks after treatment. Posttreatment MRI findings were compared with pretreatment MRI findings and were graded for risk of local recurrence/residual disease on a 4-point scale. The diagnosis of treatment failure was based on tissue biopsies, which were obtained during EGA or later during follow-up. The predictive value of MRI was analyzed by using a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Only 1 patient with MRI Grade 0 or 1 findings (discrete mass<10 mm; n = 62 patients) had residual disease 6 to 8 weeks after treatment that was detected during EGA. In 5 patients with MRI findings of Grade 2a and 2b (mass>10 mm; n = 20 patients), residual disease was detected. After 2 years, 23 patients had a local failure (28%).

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We randomly selected weeks between August 2012 and May 2013 when donors were offered HIV counseling and testing (n\u00a0=\u00a06298), leaving usual procedure weeks as control (n\u00a0=\u00a05569). RESULTS: Few candidate donors chose HIV testing (n\u00a0=\u00a081, 1.3%).

Nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), which play a central role in lipid and glucose metabolism, had been hypothesized as being involved in colon cancerogenesis. In animal studies the lipid-lowering PPAR ligand bezafibrate suppressed colonic tumors. However, the effect of bezafibrate on colon cancer development in humans is unknown. Therefore, we proposed to investigate a possible preventive effect of bezafibrate on the development of colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease during a 6-year follow-up. METHODS: Our population included 3011 patients without any cancer diagnosis who were enrolled in the randomized, double blind Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) Study. The patients received either 400 mg of bezafibrate retard (1506 patients) or placebo (1505 patients) once a day. Cancer incidence data were obtained by matching a subject's identification numbers with the National Cancer Registry. Each matched record was checked for correct identification. RESULTS: Development of new cancer (all types) was recorded in 177 patients: in 79 (5.25%) patients from the bezafibrate group vs. 98 (6.51%) from the placebo group. Development of colon cancer was recorded in 25 patients: in 8 (0.53%) patients from the bezafibrate group vs. 17 (1.13%) from the placebo group, (Fisher's exact test: one side p = 0.05; two side p = 0.07).

Recently, there has been an increasing research focus in this field on the earliest years of life, however, relatively few studies have addressed the role of fathers, despite this appearing to be particularly pertinent to child behavioural development. This study aimed to examine whether father-infant interactions at age 3\u2003months independently predicted child behavioural problems at 1\u2003year of age. METHOD: A sample of 192 families was recruited from two maternity units in the United Kingdom. Father-infant interactions were assessed in the family home and coded using the global rating scales. Child behaviour problems were assessed by maternal report. Hierarchical and logistic regression analyses were used to examine associations between father-infant interaction and the development of behavioural problems. RESULTS: Disengaged and remote interactions between fathers and their infants were found to predict externalising behavioural problems at the age of 1\u2003year. The children of the most disengaged fathers had an increased risk of developing early externalising behavioural problems [disengaged (nonintrusive) interactions--adjusted odds ratio 5.33 (95% confidence interval; 1.39, 20.40): remote interactions adj.

DESIGN: This study included 9631 men and 3595 women participating in the French GAZEL cohort. Social relations (social networks, personal social support, and social relations satisfaction) were measured in 1994 by self report. Psychosocial work characteristics (decision latitude, psychological demands, and social support at work) were ascertained in 1995. Sickness absence data were collected independently. The authors studied the incidence of short (>7 days), intermediate (7-21 days), and long (>21 days) spells of absence from 1995 to 31 December 2001. Rate ratios associated with psychosocial exposures, adjusted on sociodemographic characteristics, and health behaviours, were calculated by means of log-linear Poisson regression. SETTING: A cohort of 20000 employees of France's national gas and electricity company (the GAZEL study). MAIN RESULTS: Among men and women, levels of decision latitude and personal social support below the median predicted 17% to 24% increases in absence rates.

METHODS: Thirty-six patients with histopathologically or clinically evident recurrent cervical carcinoma underwent a pretherapy and a posttherapy (18)F-FDG PET-CT for treatment response evaluation. Positron emission tomography-CT images were analyzed by 2 experienced nuclear medicine physicians. Response was categorized using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) criteria into complete metabolic response (CMR), partial metabolic response (PMR), stable metabolic disease (SMD), and progressive metabolic disease (PMD). Clinical/imaging follow-up (minimum of 6 months) and/or histopathologic findings were taken as reference standard. Patients were categorized into 2 groups, those with PMD and those without PMD (ie, CMR, PMR, and SMD).

Spatial regression models are then implemented to examine the relationship between deprivation and mortality more formally. RESULTS: The initial exploratory spatial data analysis reveals concentrations of high standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and deprivation (hotspots) in the West of Scotland and concentrations of low values (coldspots) for both variables in the rest of the country. The main spatial regression result is that deprivation is the only variable that is highly significantly correlated with all-cause mortality in all models. However, in contrast to the expected spatial heterogeneity in the deprivation-mortality relationship, this relation does not vary between regions in any of the models. This result is robust to a number of specifications, including weighting for population size, controlling for spatial autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity, assuming a non-linear relationship between mortality and socio-economic deprivation, separating the dependent variable into male and female SMRs, and distinguishing between West, North and Southeast regions. The rejection of the hypothesis of spatial heterogeneity in the relationship between socio-economic deprivation and mortality complements prior research on the stability of the deprivation-mortality relationship over time.",
        "output": "The results of this study suggest that the relationship between deprivation and mortality is not spatially heterogeneous in Scotland. This finding is consistent with the results of prior research on the stability of the deprivation-mortality relationship over time."

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of a new sonographic marker for the diagnosis of cirrhosis using hepatic vein wall changes. METHODS: A prospective pilot study evaluating 88 patients, 38 with cirrhosis and 50 with no evidence of liver disease, was undertaken. Hard copy sonograms of the hepatic veins were obtained and reviewed in a blinded fashion by 2 radiologists. The hepatic vein morphology was assessed by 3 parameters: hepatic vein wall straightness, uniformity of hepatic vein wall echogenicity, and visualization of a complete 1-cm hepatic vein segment. The 3 parameters were compared to evaluate sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of cirrhosis. Interobserver and intraobserver errors for each parameter were also calculated with kappa statistics to assess reproducibility. RESULTS: There was a strong correlation between altered straightness and nonuniformity of hepatic vein wall echogenicity and cirrhosis. The straightness parameter had superior sensitivity of 97% (95% confidence interval [CI], 85%-100%) and specificity of 91% (95% CI, 78%-97%) for diagnosis of cirrhosis. Uniformity of hepatic vein wall echogenicity was the next most useful parameter, with sensitivity of 88% (95% CI, 73%-97%) and specificity of 86% (95% CI, 72%-95%). The continuous 1-cm segment of the hepatic vein had sensitivity of 68% (95% CI, 49%-83%) and specificity of 91% (95% CI, 78%-97%). Hepatic vein evaluation was found to be more accurate than the standard sonographic parameters of portal vein diameter and splenoportal shunt.",

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation, type III (CCAM III) lesions are large, bulky tumors which can cause mediastinal shift, prevent normal pulmonary growth, and compress the esophagus, thus leading to complications of nonimmune hydrops, pulmonary hypoplasia and polyhydramnios. Because the mortality rate of untreated fetuses with CCAM and hydrops is high, early delivery or intrauterine resection of the enlarged pulmonary lobe (lobectomy) is indicated; however, open fetal resection of CCAM at less than 30 weeks is associated with perioperative mortality that approaches 40%, as well as the usual maternal and fetal morbidity of open fetal surgery. As an alternative, percutaneous laser ablation of a CCAM III lesion with hydrops was attempted. METHODS: A 30-year-old G3 P1011 with CCAM III in the left fetal hemithorax developed mediastinal shift, hydrops and polyhydramnios at 23 weeks' gestation. After pregnancy termination and open fetal resection were declined, an 18-gauge needle was placed into the fetal tumor percutaneously under real-time ultrasonographic guidance, using sterile technique with light sedation. A cleaved 400-microm Nd:YAG laser fiber was passed through the needle lumen, and using a power setting of 15 W, a total of 2,943 J of laser energy was delivered in pulses of 1.0 s at 0.2-second intervals over two sessions one week apart. RESULTS: Although tumor size decreased, the hydrops worsened and fetal death occurred.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight orthopaedic trauma subspecialists prospectively predicted the probability of bony union at 6 and 12 weeks post-operatively for an aggregate of 48 femoral and tibial shaft fractures treated at a Level 1 trauma centre. An additional orthopaedic trauma subspecialist was blinded to treating surgeon and adjudicated healing at 18 weeks. The Squared-Error Skill Score (SESS) determined the likelihood of accurate forecasting for bony union. RESULTS: Nine patients were lost follow-up, resulting in 39 fractures (81.25% retention) including 20 femoral and 19 tibial fractures. Fourteen fractures were open, 15 were not-yet united at final follow-up. SESS values were 0.25-0.77. The ability to predict union (sensitivity) was 1.000. The ability to predict nonunions (specificity) was 0.330-0.500. The probability of a correct predicted union was 0.727 and correct predicted nonunion at final follow-up was 1.000. AO/OTA type A fractures pattern predictions were highly accurate. As body mass index increased, predictions trended toward decreased accuracy (p=0.06). Tobacco use, age, gender, associated injuries, open fractures, and surgeons' years in clinical practice were not associated with accuracy of predictions.",

Very few of the available hospital-based studies of the implications of cannabis usage have involved psychiatric intensive care units (PICU); but PICU receive many of the most challenging and resource-hungry-and incompletely understood-patients in the mental health system. AIMS: To study the clinical impact of cannabis abuse in a PICU, and to compare the use of atypical and typical antipsychotics in this setting. METHOD: 115 patients admitted to a PICU consented to take part in an open label naturalistic study. BPRS, TCI-240, weight, length of admission and routine bloods were evaluated in all participants. RESULTS: There was a high rate of cannabis abuse (71.3%) in the PICU population. Patients who abused cannabis spent longer in PICU because their psychoses were more severe. They were younger at first hospital admission. Cannabis also had metabolic implications, with higher blood glucose levels at admission and greater weight increase. Atypical antipsychotics were effective in treating psychosis inpatients positive to cannabis at admission.",

Studies were conducted to determine the relevance of reperfusion injury in the juvenile pig, whose low levels of xanthine oxidase are similar to those of the human being. METHODS: Ischemia was induced by means of complete mesenteric arterial occlusion, volvulus, or hemorrhagic shock. Injury was assessed by means of histologic examination and measurement of lipid peroxidation. In addition, myeloperoxidase, as a marker of neutrophil infiltration, and xanthine oxidase-xanthine dehydrogenase were measured. RESULTS: Significant ischemic injury was evident after 0.5 to 3 hours of complete mesenteric occlusion or 2 hours of shock or volvulus. In none of these models was the ischemic injury worsened by reperfusion. To maximize superoxide production, pigs were ventilated on 100% O2, but only limited reperfusion injury (1.2-fold increase in histologic grade) was noted. Xanthine oxidase-xanthine dehydrogenase levels were negligible (0.4 +/- 0.4 mU/gm).",

METHODS: A system-based risk assessment tool was developed using these categories: Neurological, Airway, Respiratory, Cardiovascular, and Other (NARCO) with a subcomponent grading surgical severity (SS). Anaesthesiologists reviewed the preoperative assessments and assigned NARCO, SS, and ASA-PS scores independently. Perioperative outcomes were recorded by trained observers. Validity and reliability of the tools were evaluated. RESULTS: NARCO correlated with ASA-PS (\u03c1=0.664; P<0.01) supporting its criterion validity. Inter-rater reliability of the measures was supported (intraclass correlation coefficients 0.71-0.96; \u03ba 0.43-0.87) except for the Airway category. Measures of exact agreement were slightly better for NARCO compared with ASA-PS. NARCO, SS, and ASA-PS scores correlated significantly with perioperative escalation of care, adverse events (AE), hospital length of stay, and admission status. Correlations between NARCO and ASA-PS and outcomes improved when SS was factored into their coding. There were significant, but low, correlations between all measures and mortality. The odds of having escalation of care, AE, and mortality were 5-47 times greater among children with higher risk scores.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board; patient informed consent was waived. Unresectable chemorefractory colon cancer liver metastases treated with (90)Y radioembolization in 28 patients were evaluated at pre- and posttreatment multidetector computed tomographic (CT) and FDG PET scans. Maximum cross-sectional diameter, volume, and overall attenuation of target lesions were calculated. The percentage change (%Delta) in these parameters after treatment was calculated and correlated with the standardized uptake value (SUV) analysis at FDG PET. The accuracy of the radiologic parameters in helping predict response to treatment at FDG PET was assessed. Data were analyzed by using the Student t, Wilcoxon matched pair, Mann-Whitney, Spearman rank correlation, and chi(2) tests. The significance level was set at .05.

Not all patients with musculoskeletal pain (MP) seek care at their general practitioner (GP), but for those who do, the GP's knowledge of what work-related factors might have influenced the patient's decision to seek care could be important in order to give more well-founded advice to our patients. The objective of this study was to elucidate the effects of workloads on care-seeking for back pain or upper extremity pain during an eighteen-month follow-up period. METHODS: This is a prospective study with a baseline questionnaire and eighteen-month follow-up. Among the registered patients of 8 GPs, we identified 8,517 persons between 17 and 65 years of age, who all received the questionnaire. A total of 5,068 (59.5 %) persons answered.

A series of geographically weighted regression models were run for all 3,070 counties and the z-scores and significance of the models mapped. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The association between primary care physician supply and mortality was not observed in contrast to other studies; mapping the residuals of those models suggested regional clustering. When weighted geographically, the relationship between primary care and specialist physician supply and mortality presents a mixed pattern. The results show strong regional patterns that may explain the lack of a consistent national association.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a single blind, randomized controlled trial to test recruitment strategies within the larger txt2stop smoking cessation trial. 1862 people who were eligible for the txt2stop trial but had not yet consented to join were randomized to receive either A) a reminder about the txt2stop trial plus a message that there were only 300 places left, or B) a reminder about the trial only. The outcome was the participant's consent to join the txt2stop trial 3days after messages were sent. RESULTS: Of 895 participants randomized to the intervention group, 90 (10.1%) had consented to join the txt2stop trial. Of the 967 participants randomized to the control group, 67 (6.9%) had consented to join the txt2stop trial (OR=1.50, 95% CI 1.07-2.12).

DESIGN: A multicentre observational study. PATIENTS: Prepubertal children (n = 825) with idiopathic growth failure who were subsequently treated with GH were divided into two groups, based on their maximum GH response to pharmacological stimulation testing: (1) idiopathic GH deficiency (IGHD), defined by a maximum GH response<10 microg/l (n = 300); and (2) idiopathic short stature (ISS), with a maximum GH response>or = 10 microg/l (n = 525) (GH conversion factor: 3 IU = 1 mg). MEASUREMENTS: Overnight spontaneous GH secretion was measured in all patients. The following characteristics of spontaneous GH secretion were studied: maximum or peak GH, mean peak GH, number of GH peaks, pooled GH, mean GH, and approximate entropy of GH secretion. RESULTS: Although children with IGHD had lower indices of spontaneous GH secretion, there were no differences between IGHD and ISS groups in baseline Ht SDS, growth rate or IGF-I level. The dose and duration of GH therapy were similar. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean (+/- SD) change in Ht SDS (deltaHt SDS) in the two groups (IGHD 1.3 +/- 0.9 and ISS 1.2 +/- 0.9).

We studied, prospectively, the association of EBV and vitamin D status with the risk of pregnancy-associated breast cancer (PABC), breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy or 1 year post-partum, using a nested case-control study. METHODS: Serum vitamin D and antibodies to EBV were measured for 108 PABC cases of the Finnish Maternity Cohort, and 208 controls matched for date of birth, date of sampling and parity. The joint effect of vitamin D and EBV on the risk of PABC was evaluated. RESULTS: EBV seropositivity was generally not associated with the risk of PABC. Among individuals with sufficient (\u226575 nmol/l) levels of vitamin D, we, however, found similar increased risk estimates for PABC associated with serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to EBV early antigens [odds ratio (OR)=7.7, 95% (confidence interval) CI 1.4-42.3]and the viral reactivator protein, ZEBRA (OR=7.8, 95% CI 1.1-61.2).",

However, the photoreceptor (PR) subtype-specificity of expression remains unclear. Here, we evaluated whether the presence of certain cis-elements in this proximal promoter, such as the rod-specific, neural retina leucine zipper protein (NRL) response element (NRE), can render it a driver of rod-specific expression. METHODS: Subretinal injections of a serotype 5 rAAV vector carrying the green fluorescent protein (GFP) cDNA, driven by mOP500, were administered to male Sprague-Dawley rats at postnatal day (P) 40-48. Two weeks to eight months later, the distribution of GFP-expressing cells in the retina was characterized by GFP-, cone-specific alpha-transducin-immuno-, and peanut agglutinin-lectin histochemistry and by morphological criteria. The same viral suspension was also injected sub-retinally into rhodopsin-knockout rho (-/-) mice either at P18 or P78, and retinas were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and PNA lectin histochemistry two weeks later. RESULTS: GFP reactivity was found exclusively in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) of rat retinas two weeks after treatment, with abundant reporter gene expression observed in both rods and cones. GFP-positive cones, defined by their typical morphology and the co-linearity of PNA-lectin labeling with GFP-immunoreactivity, were also observed in the inner nuclear layer (INL). In contrast, GFP-positive cells were not detected in the inner segments of cones. In rhodopsin-knockout mice, GFP-positive cells were found in the ONL, but not in the INL.",

In prior studies, however, after adjusting for age and body size, AoD did not differ between hypertensive and normotensive (NT) individuals. Hypertension is a heterogeneous condition with various subtypes that differ in pathophysiology and age distribution. We assessed whether AoD differs among subjects with the various subtypes of hypertension and nonhypertensive individuals. METHODS: In 1,256 volunteers aged 30-79 years (48% women, 48% hypertensive; all untreated), AoD was measured at the sinuses of Valsalva with transthoracic echocardiography. Using cutoff values based on the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, subjects were identified as NT (23%), or prehypertensive (PH, 29%), or as having isolated diastolic (IDH, 6%), isolated systolic (ISH, 12%), or systolic-diastolic (SDH, 30%) hypertension. Groups were compared using analysis of variance with Bonferroni's correction. RESULTS: AoD increased with age and body surface area (BSA) in both men (r = 0.25 and 0.19, respectively) and women (r = 0.30 and 0.22, respectively) (all P<0.0001). In men, those identified as having IDH, ISH, and SDH each had a 6% larger AoD than NT individuals (all P<0.05).

        "input": "BACKGROUND: The Ghana Community based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) strategy targets to bring health services to the doorsteps of clients in a manner that improves maternal and child health outcomes. In this strategy, referral is an important component but it is threatened in a rural context where transportation service is a problem. Few studies have examined perceptions of rural dwellers on transportation challenges in accessing maternal health care services within CHPS. METHODS: Using the political ecology of health framework, this paper investigates transportation barriers in health access in a rural context based on perceived cause, coping mechanisms and strategies for a sustainable transportation system. Eight (8) focus group discussions involving males (n\u2009=\u200940) and females (n\u2009=\u200945) in rural communities in a CHPS zone in the Upper West Region of Ghana were conducted between September and December 2013. RESULTS: Lack of vehicular transport is suppressing the potential positive impact of CHPS on maternal and child health. Consistent neglect of road infrastructural development and endemic poverty in the study area makes provision of alternative transport services for health care difficult. As a result, pregnant women use risky methods such as bicycle/tricycle/motorbikes to access obstetric health care services, and some turn to traditional medicines and traditional birth attendants for maternal health care services.",
        "output": "The study reveals that the CHPS strategy is not achieving its intended objectives due to lack of transportation services. The study recommends that the government should prioritize road infrastructure development and provision of transport services in rural areas to ensure access to health care services."

OBJECTIVES: In this subanalysis, we sought to evaluate gender differences in the effect of these different strategies. METHODS: The patients (749 women and 1,708 men) were randomized to early invasive or noninvasive strategies. Coronary angiography was performed within the first 7 days in 96% and 10% of the invasive and noninvasive groups, respectively, and revascularization was performed within the first 10 days in 71% and 9% of the invasive and noninvasive groups, respectively. RESULTS: Women presenting with unstable CAD were older, but fewer had previous infarctions, left ventricular dysfunction and elevated troponin T levels. Women had fewer angiographic changes. There was no difference in MI or death at 12 months among women in the invasive and noninvasive groups (12.4% vs. 10.5%, respectively), in contrast to the favorable effect in the invasively treated group of men (9.6% vs. 15.8%, p<0.001).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-two patients with multiple injuries underwent MDCT for the chest and abdomen using a standardized 4-MDCT trauma protocol (collimation, 4 x 2.5 mm). Secondary reconstructions targeted to the spine were performed (slice width, 3 mm; reconstruction interval, 1.5 mm). All spinal fractures were additionally scanned using a collimation of 4 x 1 mm, and these images served as the standard of reference for fracture classification. An additional 50 patients with no spinal fracture served as the control group. A total of 65 major spinal fractures were present in 55 of the patients with multiple injuries. Two observers (observer 1 and observer 2) independently evaluated all CT data for spinal fractures using a 5-point confidence scale, classified the different fracture types, and rated the image quality of spinal structures on axial images and multiplanar reformations. RESULTS: Image quality for axial images was excellent in 80% and in 68% using 4 x 1 mm and 4 x 2.5 mm collimation, respectively. Image quality of the multiplanar reformations was excellent in 75% and good in 65% using 4 x 1 mm and 4 x 2.5 mm collimation, respectively.

RESULTS: These infants received an average of 2.02 transfusions, far fewer than the 7 to 11 previously reported for VLBW infants. Infants with a BW of 1251 to 1500 gm received very few transfusions. More than three quarters of transfused infants received a transfusion in the first 2 weeks of life before r-HuEPO would be expected to be effective. Assigning units to individual infants and holding the units for 14 days, a practice adopted in our blood bank in 1993, resulted in a 44% decrease in donor exposures in infants receiving more than one transfusion. Holding assigned units for 30 days, a practice our blood bank has now adopted, should result in 56% of all transfused infants having a single donor exposure and 89% having one or two donor exposures.

Quality management including benchmarkings yields considerable variations between different hospitals. However, an enduring and significant decrease in the frequency and duration of such coercive measures so far has not been achieved by means of quality management. A new set of approaches is therefore required. RESULTS: Amending the British practice of \"physical restraint\" for German conditions, a technique of holding the patient was developed accompanied by manualised interventions of verbal de-escalation. In contrast to mechanical restraint, the technique represents a therapeutic intervention and is usually of short duration.

This study examines the impact of receiving feedback via performance benchmarks on medical students' self-assessment after a clinical performance examination (CPX). METHODS: The authors developed a practice-based learning exercise at 3 institutions following a required 8-station CPX for medical students at the end of Year 3. Standardised patients (SPs) scored students after each station using checklists developed by experts. Students assessed their own performance immediately after the CPX (Phase 1). One month later, students watched their videotaped performance and reassessed (Phase 2). Some students received performance benchmarks (their scores, plus normative class data) before the video review. Pearson's correlations between self-ratings and SP ratings were calculated for overall performance and specific skill areas (history taking, physical examination, doctor-patient communication) for Phase 1 and Phase 2. The 2 correlations were then compared for each student group (i.e. those who received and those who did not receive feedback). RESULTS: A total of 280 students completed both study phases. Mean CPX scores ranged from 51% to 71% of items correct overall and for each skill area. Phase 1 self-assessment correlated weakly with SP ratings of student performance (r = 0.01-0.16).

Diabetes knowledge was collected immediately after the group visit and again by telephone one to four months later. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), lipids, and blood pressure were collected from the patient electronic medical record before and, where available, three months after the group visit. Data analysis includes descriptive statistics and Students t-testing to determine pre- and posttest differences of diabetes knowledge and physiological markers. RESULTS: Thirty-eight adult outpatients participated in the study. Nearly half responded that they never needed to have someone help with written medical materials. There was a significant increase from pretest to immediate posttest diabetes knowledge scores (N = 3; M = 5.58 to M = 7.53 out of 10), t(38) = -5.217, p =<0.001 and a significant decrease in HbA1c from pretest to posttest group education (M = 9.16 to M = 8.52), t(27) = 2.185, p = .038.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: An endpoint for clinical trials of prostate cancer which simplifies traditional endpoints (response of measurable lesions, progression rates, and death) is urgently needed. This is especially true for hormone-unresponsive disease, for which many new drugs are presently in a development phase. This paper presents a rationale for the use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in clinical trials of progressive prostate cancer under endocrine treatment. METHODS: The study is based on 84 patients who progressed after radical prostatectomy or node dissection, of whom 24 showed increasing PSA levels under subsequent endocrine treatment. An average linear relationship between (log-transformed) PSA and time and a subject-specific deviation from this average relationship were assessed. The predictive value of the subject-specific parameters of the linear fit with respect to time to prostate cancer-specific death was determined. The outcomes of the fitting procedure were used to calculate sample sizes for future studies (duration, 6 months) using PSA increase over time in hormone-unresponsive prostate cancer as a marker for treatment efficacy. RESULTS: The average PSA doubling time in this population was 4 months (corresponding time constant = 0.25). The assessed variance of the time constants equalled 0.04; the overall residual variance equalled 0.265. The subject-specific rate of change of the log-transformed PSA value in hormone-unresponsive prostate cancer was a highly significant predictor of prostate cancer-specific death. This suggests the potential usefulness of PSA as an endpoint in trials of hormone-unresponsive prostate cancer. Depending on conditions chosen (e.g, desired power and changes in log PSA slope), 18-70 participants per arm will be necessary in future phase III studies. A suggestion (algorithm) for the use of PSA in drug development is presented.",

The occurrence of MA attacks after microbubble (MB) injection during contrast-enhanced transcranial Doppler (ce-TCD) has been recently described. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyze the prevalence of RILES in a consecutive cohort of MA patients and to characterize the occurrence of MA attacks after diagnostic ce-TCD. METHODS: A total of 159 consecutive MA patients underwent ce-TCD with air-mixed saline to disclose RILES. RILES was characterized in terms of MB amount (small-moderate or large) and occurrence at rest and/or during Valsalva maneuver (permanent or latent). RESULTS: RILES was revealed in 79/159 patients (\u223c 50%). Permanent RILES were detected in 56/79 (71%) and latent RILES in 23/79 (29%) MA patients. The occurrence of a typical MA attack was overall observed in 12/159 patients (7.5%; 95% CI: 4-12.8%), but arose only in RILES-positive ones, immediately after ce-TCD (12/79; 15.2%; P<\u2009.001). All 12 patients had permanent RILES (12/56; 21.4%; P=\u2009.015) and MA attack was mostly observed in large RILES-positive patients, even without statistical significance (P=\u2009.118).",

The following studies were performed 1 week (acute phase, n = 3) and 12 weeks (chronic phase, n = 6) after ITA harvesting. All specimens of the ITAs were stained by antibodies against von Willebrand Factor (VWF), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). After observation with confocal laser scanning microscopy, quantitative analyses of the staining signal for VWF and eNOS expressed on endothelial cells were performed. RESULTS: There were significantly more microvessels positive for VWF in the adventitia of skeletonized ITAs than in the adventitia of pedicled ITAs but the expression of PCNA in both groups was minimal, as in normal vessels. iNOS was not detected in any specimen.

METHODS: To monitor pressure in the collateral circulation, a catheter was inserted into the distal end of the divided first lumbar segmental artery (SA) of 10 juvenile Yorkshire pigs (28.9+/-3.8kg). SA pairs from T3 through L5 were serially sacrificed at 32 degrees C; SCPP and function - using motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) - were continuously monitored until 1h after clamping the last SA. Intermittent aortic and SCPP monitoring was continued for 5 days postoperatively, along with evaluation of motor function. RESULTS: A mean of 14.4+/-0.7 SAs were sacrificed without loss of MEP. SCPP (mmHg) dropped from 68+/-7 before SA clamping (77% of aortic pressure) to 22+/-6 at end clamping, and 21+/-4 after 1h, reaching its lowest point - 19+/-4 - after 5h.

Previous studies which have shown pathological correlates between white coat hypertension and target organ damage have not controlled for the most obvious confounder, mean 24 h blood pressure (BP). METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study we retrospectively identified 33 age and sex-matched pairs, one group with normal BP, the other with white coat hypertension. The white coat hypertensive group showed significantly greater left ventricular mass indexed for body surface area than normal controls (99.0 g/m2 vs 78.3 g/m2, P<0.001). The population was then further matched for 24-h mean BP (20 pairs), and was again compared for cardiac muscle changes.

METHODS: A retrospective audit of consecutive ileostomy closures performed in a tertiary colorectal unit from January 2008 to January 2010. Demographic data, treatment data and complications were collected by a single investigator from a prospective clinical audit database and hospital records. Patients undergoing early closure (within 10 days of the index operation) were compared with the traditional timing group. RESULTS: A total of 93 patients underwent closure of loop ileostomy during the study period (44 female; 49 male). Median patient age was 61 years. Nineteen patients (20%) underwent early closure. There were six wound infections in the early closure group (32%), and five in the traditional timing group (7%) (P = 0.01). There was no significant difference in other complications between the two groups.

Administration of dexamethasone (dex) to pregnant rats results in low birth weight offspring, which develop glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinaemia and hypercorticosteronaemia. This may be explained by tIssue-specific differences in expression of glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in adult offspring: GR is increased in visceral fat and liver, and decreased in hippocampus and soleus muscle. However, cause and effect between altered GR expression, hypercorticosteronaemia, and hyperinsulinaemia remains to be established. DESIGN AND METHODS: Rats were treated with dex (100 microg/kg per day) or saline during the third week of pregnancy. In 5-8-Month-old male offspring, GR expression in insulin target tIssues was quantified by RNase protection assay in rats that were adrenalectomised (ADX group), sham operated (SHAM group), or adrenalectomised with supra-physiological corticosterone replacement (CORT group) (n=7-8 per group), and in rats treated orally with vehicle, metformin (43 mg/kg per day) or rosiglitazone (1 mg/kg per day), after 3 weeks. RESULTS: Manipulation of corticosterone concentration did not affect GR mRNA in skeletal muscle or adipose. In liver, sham-operated animals showed lower GR mRNA, but there was no difference between adrenalectomised and hypercorticosteronaemic animals (SHAM 0.11+/-0.02, ADX 0.12+/-0.02, CORT 0.12+/-0.02). In visceral fat, GR mRNA was increased in ADX and CORT groups (ADX 0.14+/-0.02, CORT 0.15+/-0.02) compared with SHAM (0.09+/-0.02). In hippocampus, GR mRNA was decreased in ADX and CORT groups (ADX 0.07+/-0.02, CORT 0.06+/-0.02) compared with SHAM (0.10+/-0.02).

RESULTS: Large inequalities in health by (equivalent) income after differences in other socioeconomic indicators had been controlled for were observed. For example, among those in the lowest income group the risk of bad perceived health was three times as high as among people in the highest income group. The prevalence of deprivation (basic, housing, social) increased with decreasing income to approximately 50-60% in the lowest income group.

METHODS: Twenty-six subjects performed three tasks on a force platform: (1) standing with eyes open; (2) maintaining the own center of pressure (COP) displacement (internal feedback) on a target; and (3) pointing with a handheld laser pointer (external feedback) on a target. The COP and ankle displacements were measured through a force platform and a biaxial electrogoniometer, respectively, during 60\u00a0s in each task. Global posturographic parameters were computed in the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions. In addition, the standard deviation and mean frequency of the ankle movements were also calculated in the sagittal plane. RESULTS: The sway area and standard deviation of COP differed between conditions, wherein smaller and higher values were typically observed during the internal and external feedback, respectively. Conversely, both the mean frequency and the mean velocity of COP were greater during internal feedback compared with other tasks, while external feedback usually leads to smaller values. Additionally, smaller and higher values for the ankle standard deviation and the ankle mean frequency, respectively, were observed during internal feedback, with the external feedback condition showing an opposite behavior.",

PARTICIPANTS: Healthy subjects (N=18; 15 men, 3 women) aged between 22 and 37 years. INTERVENTIONS: The subjects performed 3 cycling exercises: (1) incremental CON test to determine the comfortable pedaling power (CPP) corresponding to a Borg scale rating of 12 (rate of perceived exertion); (2) steady-state CON exercise at the CPP workload to determine the corresponding plantar pressure; and (3) steady-state ECC exercise with an imposed resistance corresponding to the CPP plantar pressure. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate of perceived exertion on Borg scale, oxygen uptake (V\u02d9o2), heart rate, cardiac output, and stroke volume using inert gas rebreathing techniques were measured during steady-state CON and ECC exercises. Muscle soreness was rated on a visual analog scale immediately, 24, and 48 hours after the tests. RESULTS: No adverse effects were reported. V\u02d9o2 was about 5 times the resting value during CON exercise, while it was twice that during ECC exercise. Cardiac output was lower during ECC exercise (P<.05). This moderate increase of cardiac output was exclusively linked to a greater increase in stroke volume during ECC exercise than during CON exercise (P<.05).",

This study was undertaken to determine the value of PET scanning for assessment of disease activity in TA, by comparing PET scan data with clinical, biologic, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data assessed separately. METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with TA (according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria) underwent a total of 40 PET scans. Images were reviewed by 2 pairs of independent nuclear medicine physicians and assessed for pattern and intensity of vascular uptake. TA activity data were obtained within 15 days of the PET scans. RESULTS: PET scanning revealed abnormal vascular uptake in 47% of the 40 examinations. The uptake intensity grade was 0 in 7 scans, grade 1 in 7 scans, grade 2 in 13 scans, and grade 3 in 13 scans. Morphologic analysis was conducted by grading the pattern of the vascular uptake as diffuse (73%), segmental (20%), or focal (13%). There was a trend toward an association between clinically active disease and the semiquantitative assessment of FDG uptake (P = 0.08). We found no statistical association between levels of acute-phase reactants and intensity of uptake.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: It is accepted that nicotine in tobacco smoke causes addiction via nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system. For a long time, the tumorigenic potential of smoking was attributed to compounds other than nicotine. However, more recently data have accumulated which suggest that nicotine may add to the cancer risk by stimulating cellular growth via non-neuronal acetylcholine receptors, by suppressing apoptosis, and by inducing angiogenesis not only in atheromatous plaques but also in tumors. In the present study the possible direct genotoxic effects of nicotine on DNA were investigated in human target cells of carcinogenesis in the upper aerodigestive tract. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Human nasal mucosa, lymphatic tissue of the palatine tonsils, supraglottic epithelium of the larynx, and peripheral lymphocytes were exposed to rising concentrations of nicotine. DNA damage was investigated by alkaline single-cell microgel electrophoresis (Comet) assay. Cytotoxicity was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. RESULTS: Nicotine induced dose-dependent DNA damage in all cell types at low cytotoxic concentrations that allowed viabilities well above 80%. The lowest nicotine concentrations eliciting a significant increase in DNA migration were 1 mM for tonsillar cells and 0.25 mM for all other cell types.",

However, clinical observations studying the BDNF polymorphism and the risk of PTSD yielded contradictory results. In this meta-analysis we evaluated the association between BDNF Val66Met and PTSD risk. METHOD: Systematic searches in online databases retrieved 6 relevant publications. Different inherited models were utilized to perform the pooled analysis. Subgroup analyses and sensitive analyses based on Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) test results were also carried out. RESULTS: Our study did not found a significant overall effect of BDNF Val66Met on the susceptibility to PTSD under various genetic models. In contrast, subgroup analyses suggested that the stress status of the control group, but not ethnicity, may influence the relationship of BDNF Val66Met with PTSD risk. After the exclusion of a study that was not in HWE, our conclusions remained unchanged during the influence analyses.",

Non-contrast renal MR angiographic (MRA) techniques are potentially well suited to the screening of donors; however, their restricted imaging field of view (FOV) has previously been an important limitation. We sought to assess whether the addition of a large FOV balanced fast field echo (BFFE) steady-state free precession (SSFP) sequence to non-contrast SSFP MRA could overcome this problem. Comparison with contrast-enhanced MRA (CE MRA) and findings at surgery were performed. METHODS: 22 potential renal donors each underwent SSFP and CE MRA. 11 out of 22 potential donors subsequently underwent a donor nephrectomy. RESULTS: All images were diagnostic. Both SSFP MRA and CE MRA identified an equal number of arteries. Surgery confirmed two accessory renal arteries, both demonstrated with both imaging techniques. A third accessory vessel was identified with both techniques on a kidney contralateral to the donated organ. 6 out of 11 procured kidneys demonstrated early branch arteries at surgery, 5 out of 6 of which had been depicted on both SSFP and CE MRA. The median grading of image quality for main renal arteries was slightly better for CE MRA (p=0.048), but for accessory vessels it was better for SSFP MRA.",

We studied serum Epo levels as a possible marker of tubulointerstitial damage in the progression of IgA nephropathy (IgAN), in comparison with urinary (u-) levels of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), which is mainly derived from proximal tubular cells and is used as a marker of tubular damage. METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) with relatively preserved renal function (serum creatinine: sCr, 0.5-2.2 mg/dl) were examined. The severity of glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis of the renal biopsy tissue was expressed by semiquantitative grading scores. Clinical parameters including serum creatinine (sCr), blood pressures, and 24-h proteinuria levels were obtained at the renal biopsy. Epo was measured by a radioimmunoassay (RIA) of sera obtained in the morning and u-NAG was measured by colorimetric method of 24-h urine samples. RESULTS: The mean Epo level of the patients (17.7+/-6.3 mU/ml) was not different from the control level (19.3+/-3.7 mU/ml). There were no significant correlations between Epo levels and red blood cell (RBC) counts, haematocrit (Hct), or haemoglobin (Hb) levels.

METHODS: The study design was prospective, randomized, and open label. Pediatric patients aged 2 to 21 years in whom elective GI endoscopy under general anesthesia was required were randomized to receive propofol or standard inhalational anesthesia. The parameters monitored in the 2 groups were (1) time until wake-up after completion of the procedure, and (2) total time for anesthesia and recovery. Adverse events during the procedures were noted with each agent. RESULTS: Fifty pediatric patients were recruited, 25 in each group. The mean (SD) time until wake-up in the propofol group was 29.92 (16.01) minutes and 18.52 (10.03) minutes in the anesthesia group, (p = 0.002). With stratification into 4 age groups, it was noted that the youngest children, those 2 to 5 years of age, took the longest to awaken with propofol compared with inhalational anesthesia, whereas in the other age groups the differences were not statistically significant. In contrast, the mean total time for anesthesia and recovery in the propofol group was 107.4 (30.14) minutes and 139 (7.61) minutes in the inhalational anesthesia group (p<0.004).

AIMS: We argue that practical concerns deserve equal consideration, and present evidence strongly suggesting these concerns should be taken seriously. METHOD: Specifically, we share two historical examples that illustrate what happened in two disparate contexts (K-12 education and the Department of Defense [DOD]) when competency (or outcomes-based) assessment frameworks were implemented. We then examine how observation and assessment of clinical performance stands currently in medical schools and residencies, since these methodologies will be challenged to a greater degree by expansive lists of competencies and milestones.RESULTS/",

It is unclear whether the association is credible, in the sense that mortality and young fatherhood appear to be associated because both are determined by family-related environmental, socioeconomic and genetic characteristics. METHODS: We used a household-based 10% sample drawn from the 1950 Finnish census to estimate all-cause mortality of fathers born during 1940-1950. The fathers were followed from age 45 until death, or the end of age 54. We used a standard Cox model and a sibling fixed-effects Cox model to examine whether the effect of young fatherhood was independent of observed adulthood characteristics and unobserved early-life characteristics shared by brothers. RESULTS: Men who had their first child before the age of 22 or at ages 22-24 had higher mortality as compared with their brothers who had their first child at the median or mean age of 25-26. Men who had their first child later at ages 30-44 had lower mortality than their brothers who had a first child before the age of 25.

METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively for 40 adult patients with ITP who underwent laparoscopic (LS) and open (OS) splenectomy at Emory University Hospital between 1992 and 1999. Demographics and outcomes were recorded. Age, sex, disease duration, comorbidities (ASA>2), previous response to steroids and/or other medications, and preoperative platelet count were analyzed by univariate (t-test, Fisher's exact test) and multivariate statistical methods.

Indeed, the application of hWJ-MSCs into different animal models of disease, including those from the central nervous system, has shown remarkable therapeutic benefits mostly associated with their secretome. Conventionally, hWJ-MSCs are cultured and characterized under normoxic conditions (21 % oxygen tension), although the oxygen levels within tissues are typically much lower (hypoxic) than these standard culture conditions. Therefore, oxygen tension represents an important environmental factor that may affect the performance of mesenchymal stem cells in vivo. However, the impact of hypoxic conditions on distinct mesenchymal stem cell characteristics, such as the secretome, still remains unclear. METHODS: In the present study, we have examined the effects of normoxic (21 % O2) and hypoxic (5 % O2) conditions on the hWJ-MSC secretome. Subsequently, we address the impact of the distinct secretome in the neuronal cell survival and differentiation of human neural progenitor cells. RESULTS: The present data indicate that the hWJ-MSC secretome collected from normoxic and hypoxic conditions displayed similar effects in supporting neuronal differentiation of human neural progenitor cells in vitro. However, proteomic analysis revealed that the use of hypoxic preconditioning led to the upregulation of several proteins within the hWJ-MSC secretome.",

In this study, we tried to evaluate the relation between NE of childhood and nocturia of young adulthood. METHODS: A total of 577 female university students aged 17-24 years were included in the survey. A face-to-face questionnaire was administered concerning present nocturia and past NE history. A non-validated questionnaire, created by the authors, was used to evaluate the presence and the frequency of childhood NE and present nocturia. All participant data were checked by telephone contact with their parents. RESULTS: The overall prevalence rates of nocturia and history of nocturnal enuresis in the study population were 8.6 % and 15 % respectively. Sixteen per cent of nocturics and 15 % of non-nocturics had a history of childhood NE (p\u2009=\u20090.837). The childhood NE was graded as severe or infrequent. The presence of nocturia was compared between participants with severe NE and infrequent NE, and no significant difference was observed (11.1 % vs 7.8 %, p\u2009=\u20090.713). Nocturia frequency was compared with the history of childhood NE and we found that as the nocturia frequency increased, the rate of childhood NE also increased.",

METHODS: Information about the first-degree relatives of probands with DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia (n=90), bipolar disorder (n=90), and epilepsy (n=60) was collected by using the Family Interview for Genetic Studies (FIGS). A trained psychiatrist blind to the status of index probands obtained the information. Morbid risk in relatives was calculated using abridged Weinberg's method of age correction. RESULTS: Rates of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder were elevated in the relatives of schizophrenia and bipolar probands, but there was no evidence of coaggregation. The risk for major depression was significantly elevated in the relatives of schizophrenia probands and was comparable to the risk in the relatives of bipolar probands. LIMITATIONS: Family history method was used to obtain information about relatives. Schizoaffective disorder patients were not included in the study and this may have amplified the distinction between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.",

This study aimed to determine whether preserving the endopelvic fascia influences subsequent urinary incontinence. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Consecutive patients (n = 138) who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) for prostate cancer between October 2010 and June 2012 with a minimum of 1 year follow-up were retrospectively analysed. The subjects were divided into two groups: the non-preserved endopelvic fascia group (nPE group) and the preserved endopelvic fascia group (PE group). Continence was defined as not using any pads and having no urine leakages. Continence rates at set time-points after RALP were compared using the chi-squared test. Continence recovery rates were analysed with the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. Prognostic factors of incontinence were identified using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: The age, body mass index, preoperative prostate-specific antigen levels, prostate volume, estimated blood loss, mean operative time, Gleason score and pathological stage were not significantly different between the two study groups. The continence rate of the nPE group and PE group was 88.4% and 97.1%, respectively, at 12 months after surgery (p = 0.049), which was also significant according to the Kaplan-Meier analysis (p<0.001). Preservation of endopelvic fascia was the only significant prognostic factor for urinary incontinence (p = 0.002, hazard ratio = 1.867) according to the Cox proportional hazards model.",

The objective of this study was to compare the success of simulated IJV puncture between morbidly obese patients and a nonobese control group. METHODS: Thirty-four morbidly obese patients with body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2))>/=40 were compared with 36 patients with BMI<30. Right IJV puncture was simulated using an ultrasound probe directed towards the sternal notch at the midpoint between the sternal notch and the mastoid process. The investigator placing the probe was blinded as to the image being created on the ultrasound machine. Success rate was assessed at three different head rotation angles from midline; 0 degrees , 30 degrees , and 60 degrees . RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in successful simulated IJV puncture between two groups for any of the head positions. However, there was a higher incidence of the carotid artery (CA) puncture in the morbidly obese patient group when the head rotation was advanced from neutral position to 60 degrees (p<0.05). In addition, the ultrasound showed significantly more overlapping of the IJV over the CA in morbidly obese patients at 0 degrees (p<0.05) and 30 degrees (p<0.05). Our results show no statistically significant difference in success rate of IJV puncture between morbidly obese patients and nonobese patients. Keeping the head in a neutral position in morbidly obese patients minimizes the overlapping of the IJV over the CA and the risk of CA puncture.",

It has also been shown not to be cost-effective. The aim of this study was to determine if IOPTH \"value-added\" to decision-making during MIP. STUDY DESIGN: The study group comprised 100 consecutive patients with sporadic hyperparathyroidism and an unequivocally positive sestamibi scan who were undergoing MIP in our unit from June 2004 until October 2005, from whom blood was collected for parathyroid hormone measurement preoperatively, preexcision, and at 10 and 30 minutes postremoval. No action was taken on the results of the test. RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients were cured by MIP alone. Two patients had persistent hyperparathyroidism, one of whom was cured with subsequent open reexploration and removal of a second adenoma, and the other remains hypercalcemic despite additional open neck exploration. IOPTH in both patients failed to fall in retrospect, only the first would have been cured by conversion at the time of operation. The value-added accuracy of IOPTH was really only 1%.

METHODS: The initial item pool for the index test consisted of 15 items. In a 4-year period, a total of 12,957 persons filled out the test on a specifically designed web-site. Six thousand one hundred ninety-four complete data sets could be used for statistical analysis. The validated German version of the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI-d) served as reference standard to estimate the accuracy of the screening test. In order to test several possible ways of combining items a multi-step procedure employing univariate analyses, multiple logistic regression, and classification and regression tree analysis was applied to a learning sample and cross-validated in a test sample. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, accuracy, diagnostic odds ratio as well as adjusted odds ratio) of the items and resulting models to discriminate women with sexual dysfunction from those without were calculated. RESULTS: One dichotomous question for overall satisfaction proved to show high accuracy as a stand-alone instrument and played also a central role in multivariate models. It may be recommended as a one-question screening test (76.4% sensitivity and 76.5% specificity in the test sample). A hierarchical two-question test yielded higher sensitivity (93.5%) and lower specificity (60.1%). A slightly more extensive version consists of five questions (83.1% sensitivity and 81.2% specificity).",

Our aim is to determine whether the presence of protein and fat in a meal could involve a different postprandial glycemic response than that obtained with only carbohydrates (CHs). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This was a crossover, randomized clinical trial. Seventeen type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients on CSII wore a blinded continuous glucose monitoring system sensor for 3 days. They ingested two meals (meal 1 vs. meal 2) with the same CH content (50\u2009g) but different fat (8.9\u2009g vs. 37.4\u2009g) and protein (3.3\u2009g vs. 28.9\u2009g) contents. A single-wave insulin bolus was used, and the interstitial glucose values were measured every 30\u2009min for 3\u2009h. We evaluated the different postprandial glycemic response between meal 1 and meal 2 by using mixed-effects models. RESULTS: The postmeal glucose increase was 22\u2009mg/dL for meal 1 and 31\u2009mg/dL for meal 2. In univariate analysis, at different times not statistically significant differences in glucose levels between meals occurred. In mixed-model analysis, a time\u00d7meal interaction was found, indicating a different response between treatments along the time.

One important but under-studied design aspect is the extent to which pay-for-performance schemes reflect local priorities. The English Department of Health White Paper High Quality Care for All introduced a Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) Framework from April 2009, under which local commissioners and providers were required to negotiate and implement an annual pay-for-performance scheme. In 2010/2011, these schemes covered 1.5% (\u00a3 1.0 bn) of NHS expenditure. Local design was intended to offer flexibility to local priorities and generate local enthusiasm, while retaining good design properties of focusing on outcomes and processes with a clear link to quality, using established indicators where possible, and covering three key domains of quality (safety; effectiveness; patient experience) and innovation. We assess the extent to which local design achieved these objectives. METHODS: Quantitative analysis of 337 locally negotiated CQUIN schemes in 2010/2011, along with qualitative analysis of 373 meetings (comprising 800 hours of observation) and 230 formal interviews (audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim) with NHS staff in 12 case study sites.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed charts to identify patients with recurrent urinary tract infections who underwent surgical stone extraction and were rendered stone-free. Demographic variables as well as procedure, infectious etiology, stone composition and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome rate were also recorded. Patients were divided into 2 groups. Group 1 had no evidence of recurrent infection following surgery while recurrent infection developed in group 2. Univariate analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon signed rank and Fisher exact tests. Logistic regression was used for multivariate analysis. RESULTS: We identified 120 patients with recurrent urinary tract infections and a nonobstructive renal stone. Surgical management included shock wave lithotripsy in 32% of cases, ureteroscopy in 7% and percutaneous nephrolithotomy in 61%. Of the 120 patients 58 (48%) remained infection-free after surgery while 62 (52%) experienced recurrent infection. Factors associated with a higher risk of recurrent infections included type 2 diabetes mellitus (OR 1.73, p = 0.01), hypertension (OR 2.8, p = 0.007) and black ethnicity (OR 13.7, p = 0.009). Escherichia coli infections were more likely to resolve (OR 0.34, p = 0.01). In contrast, Enterococcus infections were more likely to persist (OR 2.5, p = 0.04). On multiple logistic regression analysis, type 2 diabetes mellitus (OR 1.73, p = 0.01) and hypertension (OR 2.8, p = 0.007) were independent predictors of recurrent infections.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Controversy continues regarding the optimal extent of primary thyroid resection in most patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), who are at minimal risk of cause-specific mortality (CSM). This study was designed to compare CSM and recurrence rates after either unilateral lobectomy (UL) or bilateral lobar resection (BLR) in patients with PTC considered low risk by AMES criteria. METHODS: Outcome was studied in 1685 patients initially treated during 1940 through 1991 and followed for up to 54 postoperative years (mean, 18 years). One thousand six hundred fifty-six patients (98%) had complete primary tumor resection; 634 (38%) had involvement of regional nodes. One hundred ninety-five patients (12%) had UL; BLR accounted for 1468 (near-total 60%; total thyroidectomy 18%). RESULTS: Thirty-year rates for CSM and distant metastasis were 2% and 3%, respectively. Twenty-year rates for local recurrence and nodal metastasis were 4% and 8%, respectively. There were no significant differences in CSM or distant metastasis rates between UL and BLR (P>.2). After UL, 20-year rates for local recurrence and nodal metastasis were 14% and 19%, significantly higher (P = .0001) than the 2% and 6% rates seen after BLR.",

Little is known about the incidence of complete heart block in those with a single ventricle L-transposition of the great arteries. In this study, we compare the incidence of complete heart block in a modern cohort of patients with L-looped single ventricle anatomy to patients with L-transposition of the great arteries and two ventricles. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with L-transposition of the great arteries who were seen at Yale-New Haven Hospital between 2001 and 2013. Patients were classified as having isolated L-transposition of the great arteries (group I), L-transposition of the great arteries and major cardiac defects with two-ventricle anatomy (group II), or L-transposition of the great arteries and single ventricle anatomy (group III). We recorded the age of onset and the circumstances of CHB in each group. We calculated the incidence rate of complete heart block and compared this between the groups. RESULTS: We identified 64 patients with L-transposition of the great arteries, median age of 21 years (range 6 months-52 years): 21 in group I, 15 in group II, and 28 in group III. In total, 15 subjects developed complete heart block, incidence of 21.9% and rate of 1.3% per person years. Although group III patients were significantly less likely to develop complete heart block than dual ventricle patients (7.1% vs. 33% and 40%, P = .01), this difference is not significant when only spontaneous complete heart block was analyzed (P = .16).",

METHODS: Participants were 30 parents (27% were male) and their children aged 5-12 years, both diagnosed with DSM-IV attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Optimal LDX dose (30, 50, or 70 mg/day) was determined for parents during a 3-week open-label titration, followed by a within-subjects trial of the acute impact of LDX and placebo on observable parent-child interactions. Two laboratory-based, parent-child interactions simulating typical family tasks (e.g., homework, joint play) were conducted within 2 weeks, once with the adult on a blinded optimal dose of LDX and once on placebo (phase I). Parents were then randomly assigned to continue blinded treatment with LDX or placebo for another month followed by a third interaction task (phase II) to assess the ongoing effects of LDX on parent-child interactions. The primary outcome was the change in rate of parenting behaviors coded during the parent-child interaction tasks. Secondary outcomes included observed rates of children's inappropriate behaviors during the laboratory tasks and changes in parental ADHD symptom severity (ADHD-Rating Scale). RESULTS: Twenty parents (67%) completed the trial. In phase I, medication was associated with a significant reduction in negative talk by parents (p = 0.0066, d = -0.47).

        "input": "INTRODUCTION: According to the general idea a doctor can start the medical management process in an adult and not legally incapacitated patient after the patient has given consent to initiate such a process. The patient's refusal makes rendering medical services impossible, irrespective of their scope and kind. It should be emphasized that such a refusal is respected if it is expressed fully, clearly and consciously. Cases in which such a refusal is expressed by an intoxicated suicidal patient, remaining under the influence of narcotics, drugs or medicaments which characterize with a similar activity should be particularly analysed. Although such a person is able to verbally declare his objection, his ability to process the information given by the doctor before initiating medical procedures is limited, or even non-existant. The refusal therefore cannot be regarded as reliable, which results in rendering medical services to the patient. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An analysis was made of Acts of Law and the opinions of the judiciar by comparing and excluding contradictory and incoherent elements. RESULTS: Despite the lack of clear regulations of a patient rejecting procedures aimed at saving the patient's life, or the prevention of serious health impairment or sustaining injury, it should be assumed that the objection expressed by the patient who does not demonstrate the ability to process the information provided by the doctor is not reliable, and the doctor is therefore still obliged to render medical services. External factors, such as consumption of alcohol, narcotics and drugs, which characterize with a similar activity impair perception and make the taking of a conscious decision impossible. Not providing medical help and introducing direct compulsion would mean neglecting provision of due diligence in the process of treatment and, as a consequence, placing the patient's health at risk, and suffering from negative implications for the patient's life and/or health in the future.",

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to systematically and extensively evaluate the immunopathology of the facet joints in patients with thoracolumbar kyphosis secondary to ankylosing spondylitis (AS). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The facet joints may be predominantly involved in the process of spinal inflammation in AS. Thus, a detailed investigation of the immunopathology at sites of facet joints is of crucial importance in understanding the pathogenesis of AS. METHODS: The facet joints were obtained from 30 AS patients and 23 age- and gender-matched controls (patients with fresh thoracolumbar fracture). The facet joints were assessed immunohistochemically by analyzing the number of infiltrating T cells (CD3, CD4, CD8), B cells (CD20), microvessel density (CD34), osteoblasts (CD56), bone marrow macrophages (CD68), and osteoclasts (CD68) per high-power field (hpf). According to the presence or absence of persistent inflammation, AS patients were divided into 2 groups: A (patients with persistent inflammation) and B (patients without persistent inflammation). Lumbar spinal mobility was assessed using the modified Schober index (MSI). RESULTS: Two or more CD3+ T cell aggregates were found in the facet joints from 18 of 30 AS patients, whereas 1 CD3+ T cell aggregate was noted in 5 of 23 patients with thoracolumbar fracture. The levels of T cells (CD4+ and CD8+), CD20+ B cells, CD34+ microvessel density, CD56+ osteoblasts, CD68+ bone marrow macrophages, and CD68+ osteoclasts were significantly higher in AS patients than in controls. The MSI was significantly correlated with the number of CD3+ T cells in the facet joints (r = 0.42, P < 0.01).",

Because selective aortic perfusion and oxygenation (SAPO) directly increases coronary perfusion pressure, exogenous epinephrine may not be required. The purpose of this study was to determine whether exogenous epinephrine is necessary during SAPO by comparing the rate of return of spontaneous circulation and aortic and coronary perfusion pressures during ACLS-SAPO in animals treated with either intra-aortic epinephrine or saline solution. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, interventional before-after trial with a canine model of ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest and ACLS based on external chest compression was performed. The ECG, right atrial, aortic arch, and esophageal pulse pressures were measured continuously. A descending aortic occlusion balloon catheter was placed through the femoral artery. Ventricular fibrillation was induced, and no therapy was given during the 10-minute arrest time. Basic life support was then initiated and normalized by standardization of esophageal pulse pressure and central aortic blood gases. After 3 minutes of basic life support, the aortic occlusion balloon was inflated, and 0.01 mg/kg epinephrine or saline solution was administered through the aortic catheter followed by 450 mL of ultrapurified polymerized bovine hemoglobin over 2 minutes.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared the outcome of 3 different but widely accepted treatment protocols for bladder cancer in order to find which, if any, was superior, with particular emphasis upon the performance of the newest treatment, neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Data on 224 bladder patients treated at our institution (1975 to 1991) with 1 of the 3 protocols was analyzed. Those protocols were: 1. radiotherapy>60 Gy (143 patients); 2. low dose radiotherapy followed by cystectomy (25 patients); 3. chemotherapy followed by either definitive radiotherapy or surgery (56 patients). Because the latter group was also a chronologically newer group with a shorter possible follow-up, we compared all treatments on the basis of 2-year survival, using Kaplan-Meier life tables. We briefly reviewed those modalities which are bladder-sparing because of the significance to quality of life of this factor. RESULTS: Two-year survival figures for the patients were: 63% for those who received only radiotherapy; 72% for those undergoing cystectomy: 68% for the group to whom neoadjuvant chemotherapy was administered.

METHODS: A sample of 292 patients discharged from an inpatient psychiatry service at an urban general hospital were randomly assigned either to an intervention group (N = 147), which received outreach case management services in addition to standard aftercare service, or to a control group (N = 145), which received only standard aftercare services. The follow-up period was 15 to 52 months. Individuals in both groups were reinterviewed by an independent research team about 21.6 months after discharge. The groups were compared using 39 measures of quality of life. The interviews elicited information about patients' physical well-being and competence in performing activities of daily living; their emotional well-being as shown in emotional expressiveness, sadness, suicidal thoughts, and substance abuse; and their interpersonal relationships, living arrangements, friendships, income maintenance, and employment.

Additionally, significant worsening in the overall risk profile of this group of patients is noted. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of chronic renal dysfunction both in non-dialysis-dependent renal failure and end-stage renal failure patients, on early mortality--morbidity and late survival in a series of cardiac surgery patients at our institution. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 1344 patients who had open heart surgery at our university hospital between 2010 and 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Chronic renal dysfunction was defined according to preoperative glomerular filtration rate. Patients selection (n=80). Group 1 mild--(GRF 59-30 mL/min), Group 2 moderate--(GFR 29-15 mL/min), Group 3 end stage--(GFR<15 mL/min) renal failure. RESULTS: Chronic renal dysfunction was present in 5.95% of all patients studied. Group 1--55 (68.75%), Group 2--16 (20%), Group 3--9 (11.25%). No difference between the groups in the need for heart inotropic support was noted; however the use of these medications was necessary in 60.6% of all studied patients.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Seizures are a potentially devastating complication of brain tumors. Several studies in the past have attempted to demonstrate that prophylactic antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in patients with brain tumors can decrease the incidence of seizures. However, it is currently unclear whether AEDs should be routinely administered to patients with brain tumors who have never had a seizure. OBJECTIVE: A meta-analysis of randomized trials was conducted to estimate the effectiveness of seizure prophylaxis in people with brain tumors. METHODS: A range of electronic databases were searched (1966-2014): MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library Database, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science and the Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) without language restrictions. Two independent reviewers assessed trials for eligibility and quality, and meta-analysis was performed using the STATA 12.0 software. Integrated Odd Ratio (OR) with its corresponding 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was calculated. RESULTS: Six RCTs were included with a total of 547 patients with brain tumors. The meta-analysis results revealed that patients with brain tumors who received prophylactic antiepileptic interventions did not have significantly lower epilepsy incidence than those in controlled groups (OR=0.939, 95%CI=0.609-1.448, z=0.29, P=0.775). Sensitivity analysis suggested the statistical results were robust. No publication bias was detected in this meta-analysis (P>0.05).",

Expansion to 38-62 CAG repeats leads to the neurodegenerative disorder with male infertility called Kennedy's disease. Recently it was suggested that slight expansion is related to male subfertility. In this study we investigated the association of male subfertility with the length of CAG repeats in the androgen receptor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CAG repeat length in the androgen receptor gene was investigated in 75 subfertile men, who were mainly candidates for intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Sperm parameters varied from azoospermia to severe oligoasthenoteratozoospermia. The control group consisted of 70 men who predominantly had bladder cancer. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood and genotyping was performed with polymerase chain reaction based methods. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference in the mean length of the CAG repeat plus or minus standard deviation was noted in subfertile men and controls (22.2 +/- 3.1 and 21.7 +/- 3.4, respectively). The length of the CAG repeat in the androgen receptor was not related to the degree of impaired spermatogenesis or clinical characteristics of the subfertile men.",

METHODS: The flexural modulus of a transparent soda-lime glass was determined by longitudinally sectioning into rectangular bar-shaped specimens and the flexural moduli of three resin-based materials (Venus Flow, Rely-X Veneer and Clearfil Majesty Posterior) was also determined. Disc shaped soda-lime glass specimens (n=240) were divided into ten groups and were alumina particle air abraded, hydrofluoric (HF) acid-etched and resin-cement coated prior to biaxial flexure strength testing. Sample sets were profilometrically evaluated to determine the surface texture. One-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc all paired Tukey tests were performed at a significance level of P<0.05. The mean biaxial flexure strengths were plotted against resin-coating thickness and a regression analysis enabled estimation of the 'actual' magnitude of strengthening. RESULTS: The mean three-point flexural modulus of the soda-lime glass was 40.0 (1.0)GPa and the Venus Flow, Rely-X Veneer and Clearfil Majesty Posterior were 3.0 (0.2)GPa, 6.0 (0.2)GPa and 14.8 (1.6)GPa, respectively. At a theoretical 'zero' resin-coating thickness an increase in biaxial flexure strength of 20.1% (63.2MPa), 30.8% (68.8MPa) and 36.3% (72.2MPa) was observed for the Venus Flow, Rely-X Veneer and Clearfil Majesty Posterior, respectively.",

Previous studies have shown that the use of SRCC in penetrating injuries is not justified because of the scarcity of unstable cervical spine injuries and the risk of obscuring other neck injuries. Explosion can inflict injuries by fragments penetration, blast injury, blunt force, and burns. The purpose of the study was to determine the occurrence of cervical spine instability without irreversible neurologic deficit and other potentially life-threatening nonskeletal neck injuries among victims of explosions. The potential benefits and risks of SRCC application in explosion-related injuries were evaluated. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of all explosion civilian victims admitted to Israeli hospitals during the years 1998 to 2010. Data collection was based on the Israeli national trauma registry and the hospital records and included demographic, clinical, and radiologic details of all patients with documented cervical spine injuries. RESULTS: The cohort included 2,267 patients. All of them were secondary to terrorist attacks. SRCC was applied to all the patients at the scene. Nineteen patients (0.83%) had cervical spine fractures. Nine patients (0.088%) had unstable cervical spine injury. All but one had irreversible neurologic deficit on admission.

It has also been demonstrated that leptin mRNA expression and protein levels increase in response to inflammatory stimuli. We hypothesized that polymorphisms in the leptin receptor, leptin and ghrelin genes, may affect their expression and, therefore, be responsible for altered response to increased leptin levels observed in asthma. To our knowledge, there were no studies on a potential role of LEPR, LEP, and GHRL polymorphisms in asthma. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 129 pediatric patients with asthma and 114 healthy children from the control group ranging from 6 to 18 years of age. The diagnosis of allergic asthma was based on clinical symptoms, the lung function test, and the positive skin prick test and/or increased immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels. Polymorphisms were genotyped by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method.

With the HIV pandemic affecting largely prime age individuals, the strong association between SAH and mortality derived from previous work might not be relevant for the younger at-risk groups in countries with high HIV prevalence in the era of antiretroviral treatment. We investigate the power of SAH to predict mortality in a community with high HIV prevalence and antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage using linked data from three sources: a longitudinal demographic surveillance, one of Africa's largest, longitudinal, population-based HIV surveillances, and a decentralised rural HIV treatment and care programme. METHODS: We used a Cox proportional hazards specification to examine whether SAH significantly predicts mortality hazard in a sample composed of 9217 adults aged 15-54, who were followed up for mortality for 8 years. RESULTS: Self-assessments of health strongly predicted mortality (within 4 years of follow-up), with a clear gradient of the adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs), relative to the baseline of 'excellent' self-assessed health status and controlling for age, gender, marital status, the socio-economic status (SES), variables education, employment, household expenditures and household assets, and HIV status and ART uptake: 1.40 (95% CI 0.99-1.96) for 'very good' self-assessed health status (SAHS); 2.10 (95% CI 1.52-2.90) for 'good' SAHS; 3.12 (95% CI 2.18-4.45) for 'fair' SAHS; 4.22 (95% CI 2.72-6.92) for 'poor' SAHS; and 5.22 (95% CI 3.42-8.02) for 'very poor' SAHS.",

OBJECTIVE: The authors investigated the performance of a decision-support classifier for the diagnosis of traumatic injury with blood loss, implemented with three different data-processing methods. For each method, they computed standard diagnostic test characteristics and novel metrics related to decision consistency and latency. SETTING: Prehospital air ambulance transport. PATIENTS: A total of 557 trauma patients. DESIGN: Continually monitored vital-sign data from 279 patients (50%) were randomly selected for classifier development, and the remaining were used for testing. Three data-processing methods were evaluated over 16 min of patient monitoring: a 2-min moving window, time averaging, and postprocessing with the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT). MEASUREMENTS: Sensitivity and specificity were computed. Consistency was quantified through cumulative counts of decision changes over time and the fraction of patients affected by false alarms. Latency was evaluated by the fraction of patients without a decision. RESULTS: All 3 methods showed very similar final sensitivities and specificities. Yet, there were significant differences in terms of the fraction of patients affected by false alarms, decision changes through time, and latency. For instance, use of the SPRT led to a 75% reduction in the number of decision changes and a 36% reduction in the number of patients affected by false alarms, at the expense of 3% unresolved final decisions.",

The purpose of this study was to compare oronasal fistula rates, long-term speech outcomes, and rates of secondary surgery for velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) after primary cleft palate repair using the modified Furlow technique between nonsyndromic patients with and without PRS. This study also sought to determine if type of airway management in infancy correlated with speech outcomes in patients with PRS. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of all nonsyndromic patients with clefts of the palate only who underwent repair between 1981 and 2006 at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia using the modified Furlow technique. Patient outcomes were evaluated by the rate of postoperative oronasal fistula, speech scores at a minimum of age 5 years using the Pittsburgh Weighted Values for Speech Symptoms Associated with VPI, and the need for secondary pharyngeal surgery for VPI. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients with PRS and 129 without PRS were included in this study. There was no significant difference in oronasal fistula rate between groups. Speech outcomes were worse in patients with PRS with 52.7% demonstrating a competent velopharyngeal mechanism, and 30.9% a borderline mechanism, compared to 72.1% and 19.4% in the non-PRS group, respectively (P = 0.035).

Although iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is related with RLS, the mechanism of this relationship is still unknown. Therefore, we decided to examine some neurophysiological parameters that reflect the function of brainstem, spinal cord and peripheral nervous system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 34 patients diagnosed with IDA at the hematology department were questioned with a structured battery for RLS and additional symptoms. Of those, 14 patients had symptoms of RLS, while remaining 20 had no signs of this disorder. In both groups, electrophysiological examination including motor and sensory nerve conduction, F-responses, H-reflex, blink-reflex, and mixed nerve silent periods was performed. RESULTS: Neurological examination of all patients was normal. The two groups were identical for age and sex, and the difference between both groups concerning motor and sensory nerve conduction, F-wave, H-reflex, blink-reflex, and mixed nerve silent periods was insignificant.",

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of data from a previous randomized clinical trial. METHODS: A total of 208 patients who were mechanically ventilated on controlled modes and met criteria for assisted breathing were randomized to receive either PS (n = 100) or PAV+ (n = 108). Changes in ventilator settings and in the dose of sedatives, analgesics, and vasoactive medications were identified during the period in which the patients were ventilated either with PS (30.4 +/- 17.4 h) or PAV+ (30.0 +/- 18.1 h) and classified as changes to facilitate weaning (CFW) or changes to respond to deterioration (CD). RESULTS: The mean number of changes in ventilator settings was significantly higher with PS than that with PAV+ (10.7 +/- 5.7 vs. 8.9 +/- 4.6). With PS the proportion of these changes classified as CFW was significantly lower than that with PAV+ (59.8% vs. 69.2%).

Successful management of vasospasm will ultimately depend on a clear understanding of the scope of this phenomenon, including whether arterial elements of different calibers are equally affected. We therefore examined the responses to subarachnoid hemorrhage in rabbit basilar arteries, small pial arteries, and arterioles. SUMMARY OF REPORT: We compared the brain stem pial arteries of 10 perfusion-fixed male New Zealand White rabbits after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage to those of five control rabbits using morphological analysis of cross-sections of plastic-embedded vessels. After subarachnoid hemorrhage, the internal elastic lamina was highly corrugated in all basilar arteries (mean diameter 319 +/- 51 microns). These arteries were severely constricted in comparison with the control group, in which the mean diameter was 691 +/- 17 microns, and corrugation of the internal elastic lamina was not present. In contrast, small pial arteries and arterioles very rarely demonstrated a vasoconstrictive configuration after subarachnoid hemorrhage. The contractility of the smaller vessels was confirmed by injecting 2 mg/kg BaCl2 intracisternally. Following BaCl2 injection, corrugation of the internal elastic lamina was detected in the small arteries and arterioles as well as the basilar arteries.",

Our aim was to seek amino acid similarities between MAP and intestinal proteins that, through molecular mimicry, could serve as targets for cross-reactive immunity in CD. METHODS: Fifty-three peptides comprising 23 sets of MAP/human intestinal peptidyl mimics chosen for maximal homology were constructed and tested for immunologic cross-reactivity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 50 patients with CD, 50 with ulcerative colitis, and 38 healthy controls. RESULTS: Antibody reactivity was present in only 7 of 23 peptide sets. MAP/self-reactivity in at least 1 of the 7 reactive sets was present in 21 (42%) CD patients but was virtually absent in the controls. Significant double-reactivity was found against MAP glycosyl transferase d (gsd)(230-244)/human gastrointestinal glutathione peroxidase (GPg)(111-125) homologues in 15 of 50 (30%) CD patients; MAP alkylohydroperoxidase C (ahpC)(20-34)/human tumor overexpressed protein (TOG)(637-651) double-reactivity was present in 10 (20%) CD patients, but in none of the controls.

However, the data are conflicting and it is not clear whether gender is a true independent risk factor for death in this setting. We analyzed our database to determine whether gender is an independent risk factor for death after CABG. PATIENTS AND DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of 1 758 isolated first-time coronary artery bypass graft patients treated between 2003 and 2005 was conducted in the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery of Rabin Medical Center, a major tertiary facility in Israel. RESULTS: The female patients had a distinctly different pre- and intraoperative profile compared with the male patients, and significantly higher postoperative mortality (p<0.05). On a propensity scoring of 359 matched pairs, the risk factors for death were found to be severe left ventricular dysfunction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and use of an intra-aortic balloon pump (p<0.05). The addition of intraoperative data to the model yielded only cardiopulmonary bypass time and use of an intra-aortic balloon pump as risk factors for death (p<0.05). Validation with the bootstrap technique revealed that strong predictors of death (>50 % of the sample) were cardiopulmonary bypass time, use of an intra-aortic balloon pump, and, to a lesser extent, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

We studied the reliability of this technique intra- and inter- assay, as well as inter-batch- and inter-laboratory-assay. METHODS: Twenty samples were studied, nineteen sera from polysensitized allergic patients, and the technique calibrator provided by the manufacturer (CTR02). We measured the sIgE from CTR02 and three patients' sera ten times in the same and in different assays. Furthermore, all samples were tested in two laboratories and with two batches of ISAC kit. To evaluate the accuracy of ISAC 112, we contrasted the determinations of CTR02 calibrator with their expected values by T Student test. To analyse the precision, we calculated the coefficient of variation (CV) of the 15 allergens that generate the calibration curve, and to analyse the repeatability and the reproducibility, we calculated the intraclass coefficient correlation (ICC) to each allergen. RESULTS: The results obtained for CTR02 were similar to those expected in 7 of 15 allergens that generate the calibration curve, whereas in 8 allergens the results showed significant differences. The mean CV obtained in the CTR02 determinations was of 9.4%, and the variability of sera from patients was of 22.9%. The agreement in the intra- and inter-assay analysis was very good to 94 allergens and good to one.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether an interbody cage inserted from an anterolateral direction stabilizes the spine with respect to the intact state and to compare the finding with that from the same cage inserted from an anterior direction. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Several biomechanical studies have shown that interbody cages do not stabilize the spine in extension. It is suspected that this may be caused by the destruction of the anterior longitudinal ligament and anterior anulus fibrosus. METHODS: Six human cadaveric lumbar functional spinal units were tested under pure moments of flexion, extension, bilateral axial rotation, and bilateral lateral bending to a maximum of 10 Nm. The relative intervertebral motions were measured by an optoelectronic camera system with the spinal units in the intact condition, after discectomy, after anterolateral interbody cage stabilization, and with additional translaminar screw fixation. The implant used was a central, porous, contoured implant with endplate fit. The results were compared with those of a previous study, which used the same implant inserted from an anterior direction. RESULTS: The anterolateral cage insertion significantly decreased the motion in comparison with the intact situation in flexion and lateral bending, but not in extension or axial rotation. No differences were found between the anterior and anterolateral insertion approaches in flexion or extension, but differences were observed in axial rotation and lateral bending, in which the anterolateral approach resulted in more motion. Additional translaminar screw fixation reduced motion to below intact levels in all loading directions. None of the surgical procedures introduced asymmetrical behavior.",

        "input": "PURPOSE: Cycling muscle recruitment is less skilled in elite triathletes than in cyclists matched for cycling training history. This finding suggests that the multidiscipline training undertaken by triathletes interferes with adaptation of the neuromuscular system to cycling training in triathletes. The purpose of this study was to determine if similar interference with adaptation of the neuromuscular system would be evident during running in elite triathletes. METHODS: We compared intramuscular electromyographic (EMG) recordings from five muscles of the leg (tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior, peroneus longus, gastrocnemius lateralis, and soleus) during running at a controlled running speed between elite triathletes, runners matched to the triathletes for running training history (i.e., equally trained runners), and less-trained runners. RESULTS: Normalized EMG waveforms (i.e., time-series EMG data) were not different between groups, nor was EMG modulation (i.e., variations in EMG amplitude within strides). Individual variance (i.e., variability in muscle recruitment between strides for individual athletes) was greater for less-trained runners but was not different between elite triathletes and equally trained runners. Population variance (i.e., variability in muscle recruitment between athletes) was greater between less-trained runners for four of five muscles, but it was greater between elite triathletes than between equally trained runners for only two muscles.",

Age at diagnosis is<30 years in 90% of the cases. Because the disease is common in women of child-bearing age, management of pregnancy in these patients becomes an important issue. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the maternal and fetal outcomes in pregnancies with TA and also to evaluate whether early intervention for renal artery involvement is associated with improved outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected data of 12 patients with 18 pregnancies prospectively from 2006 to 2012. The patients were divided into three groups and their outcomes were noted: (1) without renal artery involvement; (2) with renal artery involvement without intervention; and (3) with renal artery involvement for which intervention has been done. RESULTS: Body mass index of patients was between 18.5 kg/m(2) and 23.2 kg/m(2). Renal artery involvement and hypertension were seen in four patients. One patient had percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty and another had renal artery stenting. In patients without renal artery involvement, gestational hypertension was seen in 50%, pre-eclampsia in 10%, abortion in 10%, and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) in 40% of pregnancies. In patients with renal artery involvement without intervention, gestational hypertension was seen in 90%, pre-eclampsia in 20%, abortion in 60%, preterm delivery in 40%, and IUGR in 60% of pregnancies.

METHODS: We performed a treadmill calibration protocol to determine cut points for moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) (\u22653 metabolic equivalents) and assessed free-living PA in 44 severely obese subjects using the Actigraph GT1M accelerometer. We obtained cut points in 42 subjects (11 men, mean (standard deviation) of body mass index (BMI) 39.8 (5.7), age 43.2 (9.2) years), of whom 35 had valid measurement of free-living PA (minutes of MVPA/day). Linear regression was used to analyze associations with the ICPs and time in MVPA/day. MVPA/day was also compared with values derived using a group cut point (GCP). RESULTS: Resting oxygen consumption (partial r = 0.74, p<.001), work economy (partial r = -0.76, p<.001) and BMI (partial r = 0.52, p = .001) explained 68.4% of the variation in the ICPs (F = 26.7, p<.001).

We evaluated housestaff experience with a pilot intervention that replaced postcall continuity clinics with evening continuity clinics. METHODS: We began this pilot program at one continuity clinic site for pediatric residents. Instead of postcall clinics, residents had evening continuity clinic added to a regular clinic day when they were neither postcall nor on call. At 5 and 11 months, we surveyed housestaff satisfaction and experience with the evening clinics, particularly in comparison to postcall clinics. RESULTS: Nineteen of 23 pediatric residents participated in the pilot program. Twenty-two and 17 residents completed the 5- and 11-month follow-up surveys, respectively. A significantly greater proportion of residents rated their overall satisfaction with evening clinic as good/outstanding (16/18, 89%) compared with postcall clinic (2/19, 11%) at the 5-month survey (P<.01). Resident preference for evening clinic over postcall clinic persisted but was not statistically significant at 11 months (P =.05), and overall satisfaction with evening clinic was unchanged from the 5- and 11-month surveys (P =.64).

Previous authors have reported that diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) and CTS were differentiated by evaluating the sensory conduction velocity (SCV) distal to the palm. This study aimed to clarify this issue. METHODS: The subjects consisted of 30 DPN patients without clinical CTS and 50 CTS patients without diabetes mellitus. An antidromic sensory conduction study stimulating the median nerve at the wrist and palm was performed. The SCV distal to the palm (SCVpf) and across the carpal tunnel (SCVwp) and the sensory nerve action potential amplitude following palmar stimulation (AMP-p) were evaluated. RESULTS: The SCVwp was significantly lower than the SCVpf in DPN patients, implying the frequent presence of subclinical lesion at the carpal tunnel. The SCVpf was similar for both groups. The AMP-p was disproportionately low in relation to SCVwp in DPN patients, as compared with CTS patients.",

METHOD: The model was adapted to the hemodynamic particularities of myocardial bridges and used to estimate by means of a numerical example the cyclic increase in axial wall stress in the vessel segment proximal to the bridge. The consistence of the results with reported observations on the presence of atheroma in the proximal, tunneled, and distal vessel segments of bridged coronary arteries was also examined.

We excluded 212 transports because of missing data. RESULTS: A total of 24 506 ambulance transports met the inclusion criteria. L&S were used 4066 times, or in 16.6% of all missions. Of these, 40% were graded NACA less than 4. Overall, the mean total transport time to return to the hospital was 11.09 min (confidence interval 10.84-11.34) with L&S and 12.84 min (confidence interval 12.72-12.96) without. The difference was 1.75 min (105 s; P<0.001). For night-time runs alone, the mean time saved using L&S was 0.17 min (10.2 s; P=0.27).",
        "output": "The use of L&S is associated with a significant time saving in transport to the hospital. This time saving is greater during daytime runs and for patients with a higher NACA score."

        "input": "OBJECTIVES: Inclusion of information on early-life socio-economic position (SEP) in population chronic disease and risk factor surveillance systems enables better monitoring of effects of policies and interventions on health inequities and intergenerational disadvantage. Examining data quality, in terms of item non-response, informs choices about which indicators of early-life SEP to include in surveillance questionnaires. This study examined differences in recall of indicators of early-life SEP between different socio-economic groups. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional population survey. METHODS: A representative population of people aged 18 years and over living in South Australia (n=2999) was selected at random from the electronic white pages, and a computer-assisted telephone interview was administered. RESULTS: Respondents with missing data on early-life SEP indicators were disadvantaged in terms of current SEP compared with those who provided this information. Among all respondents, the highest proportions of missing data were observed for maternal grandfather's main occupation (27.2%), and mother's (20.1%) and father's (19.6%) highest level of education. Family structure, housing tenure and family financial situation when the respondent was 10 years old, and mother's and father's main occupation were the indicators of early-life SEP that performed best in terms of recall.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The vertebral augmentation procedures, vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, can relieve pain and facilitate mobilization of patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Kyphoplasty also aims to restore vertebral body height before cement injection and so may be advantageous for more severe fractures. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the ability of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty to restore vertebral height, shape, and mechanical function after severe vertebral wedge fractures.STUDY DESIGN/ SETTING: This is a biomechanical and radiographic study using human cadaveric spines. METHODS: Seventeen pairs of thoracolumbar \"motion segments\" from cadavers aged 70-98 years were injured, in a two-stage process involving flexion and compression, to create severe anterior wedge fractures. One of each pair underwent vertebroplasty and the other kyphoplasty. Specimens were then compressed at 1 kN for 1 hour to allow consolidation. Radiographs were taken before and after injury, after treatment, and after consolidation. At these same time points, motion segment compressive stiffness was assessed, and intervertebral disc \"stress profiles\" were obtained to characterize the distribution of compressive stress on the vertebral body and neural arch. RESULTS: On average, injury reduced anterior vertebral body height by 34%, increased its anterior wedge angle from 5.0\u00b0 to 11.4\u00b0, reduced intradiscal (nucleus) pressure and motion segment stiffness by 96% and 44%, respectively, and increased neural arch load bearing by 57%. Kyphoplasty caused 97% of the anterior height loss to be regained, and 88% of the wedge angle to be reduced. Vertebroplasty caused 84% of the anterior height loss to be regained, and 81% of the wedge angle to be reduced. Kyphoplasty also increased the intradiscal pressure and motion segment stiffness by 100% and 50%, respectively, and reduced the neural arch load bearing by 44%. Vertebroplasty increased the intradiscal pressure and motion segment stiffness by 100% and 44%, respectively, and reduced the neural arch load bearing by 44%.",
        "output": "Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are both effective in restoring vertebral height and shape after severe vertebral wedge fractures. Kyphoplasty is superior to vertebroplasty in terms of restoring vertebral height, but vertebroplasty is superior to kyphoplasty in terms of restoring vertebral shape."

METHODS: Echocardiographic studies performed for clinical indications were reviewed retrospectively. All consecutive subjects \u226418 years of age were included. The cohort was divided into those with normal echocardiographic findings and those with disorders affecting the right ventricle. Digitally recorded images were analyzed for both MM-TAPSE and 2D-TAPSE. Measurements of 2D-TAPSE were made in an apical four-chamber view, from the tricuspid valve annulus to a consistent point at the apex of the imaging sector at end-diastole and end-systole, with the difference representing the 2D-TAPSE value. RESULTS: A total of 329 subjects (mean age 9.0 \u00b1 6.1 years) met entry criteria. Correlation coefficient between MM-TAPSE and 2D-TAPSE was 0.90. Bland-Altman analysis showed agreement between the two methods to be within 1.2 \u00b1 2.6 mm (mean percentage difference of 6.5%).

Our goal was to describe wait times from referral by the primary care provider to rheumatology consultation and to explore whether wait times are associated with type of arthritis diagnosis, geographic area, or type of rheumatology office. METHODS: Appointments were requested by telephone using case scenarios that were created by a group of experts and included (1) presumed RA, (2) possible RA, and (3) presumed OA. Wait times were evaluated as the time between the initial request and the appointment date provided. We used descriptive statistics, bivariate analysis, and logistic regression in the analysis. RESULTS: For all scenarios combined, 34% were given an appointment with a rheumatologist within 3 months of referral, 32% waited longer than 3 months, and 34% were told that the rheumatologist was not accepting new referrals at the time the request was made.

Overweight might be associated with the occurrence of OA through other metabolic factors.AIM: To evaluate the role of overweight in HOA, cross-sectional data of a population-based study were used (>or =55 years, n = 3585). The role of diabetes, hypertension and total cholesterol:high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol ratio on HOA, and whether they play an intermediate role in the association of overweight/HOA was investigated. Furthermore, the prevalence of HOA in the concurrent presence of overweight and other metabolic factors was evaluated. RESULTS: Independently of other metabolic factors, overweight (body mass index (BMI)>27.4 kg/m(2)) showed a significant association with HOA (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.7). The association between diabetes and HOA was only present in people aged 55-62 years (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.0 to 3.8), but was absent in the total population or in other age groups. The association of hypertension with HOA was weak, and disappeared after adjustment for BMI. The total/HDL cholesterol ratio showed no significant association with HOA. The concurrent presence of overweight, diabetes and hypertension resulted in an even higher prevalence of HOA (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.3 to 3.9) compared with subjects with none of these characteristics; this prevalence increased further in the younger age group (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 8.9).",

This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs) therapy in the freshly grafted ovaries 30\u00a0days after injection. METHODS: Rat ASCs (rASCs) obtained from transgenic rats expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-(5\u2009\u00d7\u200910(4) cells/ovary) were injected in topic (intact) or freshly grafted ovaries of 30 twelve-week-old adult female Wistar rats. The whole ovary was grafted in the retroperitoneum without vascular anastomosis, immediately after oophorectomy. Vaginal smears were performed daily to assess the resumption of the estrous cycle. Estradiol levels, grafts morphology and follicular viability and density were analyzed. Immunohistochemistry assays were conducted to identify and quantify rASC-GFP(+), VEGF tissue expression, apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3 and TUNEL), and cell proliferation (Ki-67). Quantitative gene expression (qPCR) for VEGF-A, Bcl2, EGF and TGF-\u03b21 was evaluated using RT-PCR and a double labeling immunofluorescence assay for GFP and Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) was performed.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been shown in rodent models to promote primary and pulmonary metastatic sarcoma growth when injected in the presence of gross tumor. In theory, this would limit their use in a clinical setting after limb salvage treatment for osteosarcoma. Although concerning, these models do not translate to the clinical setting wherein MSCs could be used after primary tumor resection to aid in bone healing and incorporation of tumor endoprostheses. If we can determine whether the use of MSCs in this setting is safe, it might improve our ability to augment bone healing in patients undergoing limb salvage.QUESTIONS/ PURPOSES: The purpose of this study was to determine (1) whether MSCs promote pulmonary metastatic disease progression in a murine osteosarcoma model; and/or (2) whether they affect local disease recurrence in the presence of microscopic residual osteosarcoma. METHODS: An orthotopic model of luciferase-expressing osteosarcoma was developed. At 10 days, resection of the primary tumor was performed. One hundred fourteen female C3H mice were inoculated with DLM8-luc osteosarcoma in the proximal tibia. Ninety-four mice developed orthotopic osteosarcoma with luciferase expression. Mice with bioluminescent evidence of a primary tumor received either a microscopically \"clean\" amputation at a time when residual microscopic metastatic disease was present in the lungs (pulmonary metastasis group; n = 65) or a \"dirty\" amputation (local recurrence group; n = 29). Mice were randomized to receive intravenous MSCs (n = 37) or saline (n = 37). Mice were monitored for tumor growth and survival. RESULTS: MSCs did not promote pulmonary metastatic disease progression in the murine osteosarcoma model. MSCs did not affect local disease recurrence in the presence of microscopic residual osteosarcoma.",

OBJECTIVE: To determine if high levels of perceived parental supervision and communication were associated with reduced gonorrhea (GC) and chlamydia (CT) incidence in low-income, African American, sexually experienced female adolescents, aged 14 to 19 years, attending urban health clinics. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study was used to determine the predictive value for high levels of parental supervision and communication on GC and CT infection in 158 adolescent females. Multiple logistic regression analysis explored the association between incident infection and perceived parental supervision and perceived parental communication while controlling for relevant demographic and behavioral factors (age, religious involvement, school enrollment, a 2-parent household, having a main sex partner, and having concurrent sex partners). RESULTS: When adjusted for age and baseline GC and CT infection, high levels of perceived parental supervision were associated with reduced GC and CT incidence (adjusted odds ratio, 0.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.31).

The aim was to compare the yield of the triage based on the GBS with an endoscopist' decision to perform an urgent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGIE) in newly admitted patients and inpatients with UGIH in the setting of an endoscopy on-duty service in 13 tertiary care centers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: During a 6-month period, GBS and patient data were collected for all patients with non-variceal UGIH for whom an UGIE was requested in emergency. If patients experienced severe endoscopic lesion, surgery or death, they were categorized as patients who had been at need for urgent UGIE. RESULTS: The 102 UGIH patients included (mean age 62, men 73%) had a median GBS of 12 (range 0-21), significantly lower for new patients compared with inpatients (11, range 0-21 vs. 14, range 2-21, respectively, p = 0.001).

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: Estrogens are known to exhibit antioxidative effects. At present little information exists on the influence of co-administered progestins upon this effect. Therefore we investigated the influence of levonorgestrel, a potent antiestrogenic progestin, on the inhibition of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation by 17 beta-estradiol or 17 beta-estradiol valerate in vitro and ex vivo. METHODS: After isolation from blood, the in vitro oxidation of LDL was induced by copper ions and measured continuously by monitoring the formation of conjugated dienes. In 21 female ovariectomized White New Zealand rabbits the antioxidative action of 17 beta-estradiol alone or in combination with levonorgestrel after subcutaneous infusion for 3 days was determined using the copper-induced LDL-oxidation as an endpoint. Eleven postmenopausal women were exposed to sequential estrogen-progestin replacement therapy (day 1-21:2 mg estradiol valerate/day, day 10-21: 0.15 mg levonorgestrel/day). Blood samples were collected at three times: on day 1, on day 10, on day 22 (after the combination phase). The lag time of ex vivo oxidation of LDL, the plasma estradiol and estrone levels were estimated. RESULTS: In the chosen cell-free system, 17 beta-estradiol increased the lag time of the LDL-oxidation in a dose-dependent manner. Levonorgestrel showed neither pro-oxidative nor antioxidative effects when administered alone in different concentrations. Co-administration of different doses of levonorgestrel with 17 beta-estradiol resulted in a significant decrease of the antioxidative effect of 17 beta-estradiol. In the rabbit model, the antioxidative effect of 17 beta-estradiol was significantly reduced by co-administration of levonorgestrel. In the women, the antioxidative effect of 17 beta-estradiol was significantly reduced by co-administration of levonorgestrel.",

It is known that dealing with patients' mental health problems is more time consuming in specific situations such as in consultations. But it is unclear if GPs who are more often involved in patients' mental health problems, have a higher workload than other GPs. Therefore we investigated the following: Is the attention GPs pay to their patients' mental health problems related to their subjective and objective workload? METHODS: Secondary analyses were made using data from the Second Dutch National Survey of General Practice, a cross sectional study conducted in the Netherlands in 2000-2002. A nationally representative selection of 195 GPs from 104 general practices participated in this National Survey. Data from: 1) a GP questionnaire; 2) a detailed log of the GP's time use during a week and; 3) an electronic medical registration system, including all patients' contacts during a year, were used. Multiple regression analyses were conducted with the GP's workload as an outcome measure, and the GP's attention for mental health problems as a predictor. GP, patient, and practice characteristics were included in analyses as potential confounders. RESULTS: Results show that GPs with a broader perception of their role towards mental health care do not have more working hours or patient contacts than GPs with a more limited perception of their role. Neither are they more exhausted or dissatisfied with the available time. Also the number of patient contacts in which a psychological or social diagnosis is made is not related to the GP's objective or subjective workload.",

METHODS: Computed tomographic coronary angiography patients (without history of revascularization, cardiac transplantation, and congenital heart disease) who underwent invasive coronary angiography were enrolled. Attenuation values of coronary lumen were measured before and after stenoses and normalized to the aorta. Changes in CCO were calculated, and CCO differences were compared with severity of coronary stenosis and Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow at the time of invasive coronary angiography. RESULTS: One hundred four coronary arteries (n = 52, mean age = 60.0 \u00b1 9.5 years; men = 71.2%) were assessed. Compared with normal arteries, the CCO differences were greater in arteries with computed tomographic coronary angiography diameter stenoses \u2265 50%.

Religiosity is a protective factor which has an impact on all of the three dimensions of health status, among others, it goes together with a longer lifetime, better indicators of health status indicators and quality of life, less anxiety, depression and suicide, more effective coping strategies. In relation to adolescent health, less investigation has been available thus far. OBJECTIVE: The main goal of the present study was to investigate the relationship between religiosity and psychological health among adolescents. Regarding religiosity, religious affiliation, religiousness (subjective level of religiosity) and religious participation were assessed. Among health status indicators, occurrence of depressive symptomatology, level of satisfaction with life and self-perceived health were determined. METHODS: Data collection of the questionnaire survey was going on among 881 high school students in Szeged (age range between 14-20 years, mean = 16.6 years, S.D. = 1.3 years of age, 44.6% of the sample was female). Associations between health status indicators (as dependent variables) and religiosity factors (as independent variables) were assessed using Odds Ratios calculated by logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Our findings suggest that youth's religiosity had the least effect on depressive symptomatology, whereas youth defined themselves as religious and those who actually participated at religious events perceived their own health better and they were more satisfied with their life. Girls tended to belong more to a religious community and their religiosity was more associated with life satisfaction and self-perceived health.",

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the current teaching practice of thoracic epidural procedures in the United States and to determine the effect of the teaching sequence of thoracic and lumbar epidurals on technical difficulties and complications. DESIGN AND SETTING: The first part was a survey, which was distributed to all American Board of Anesthesiology-accredited programs. The second part was a noninterventional retrospective review of 2,007 epidural procedures in a university teaching program. INTERVENTIONS: The survey questions were designed to determine the number of epidural procedures performed monthly on various services, teaching sequence, insertion technique, indications, and service provider. RESULTS: The survey received 81 responses (60%) from 134 programs; 34% of the programs placed more thoracic than lumbar epidurals, 92% of the programs placed epidurals mainly for postoperative pain control, and 88% of programs mainly teach lumbar before thoracic epidurals, whereas only 10 programs (12%) mainly teach residents thoracic before lumbar epidurals. The authors' residents were divided into 2 groups: group 1 (42 residents, 70%) who learned thoracic before lumbar epidurals and group 2 (18 residents, 30%) who learned lumbar before thoracic epidurals during their earlier obstetric anesthesia training. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in the degree of technical difficulties or the incidence of procedure-related complications.",

The examination was to determine whether there is a relationship between the clinical diagnosis of ALI/ARDS, impaired permeability and clinical parameters, that is the underlying disease, oxygenation, duration of mechanical ventilation and mean pulmonary-artery pressure (PAP). RESULTS: At the time of study, 25 patients presented with increased permeability (NSI>1 x 10(-3) min-1) indicating on exudative stage of disease, and 11 patients with normal permeability. The permeability impairment correlated with the underlying disease (p>0.05). With respect to survival, there was a negative correlation to PAP (p<0.01). Apart from that no correlations between the individual parameters were found. Especially no correlation was found between permeability impairment and oxygenation, duration of disease or PAP.",

Then we tried to evaluate the possible differences between laparoscopic RH and abdominal RH in terms of their impact on sexuality. METHODS: Consecutive sexually active women, who underwent RH for the treatment of early-stage cervical cancer between 2003 and 2007, were enrolled in this study (cases) and divided into two groups, according to the surgical approach. All women were administered the FSFI. The results of this questionnaire were compared between patients who underwent laparoscopic RH (LPS group) vs. women who underwent laparotomic RH (LPT group). The cases of RH were also compared with a control group of healthy women, who were referred to our outpatient clinic for a routine gynecologic evaluation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: FSFI questionnaire on six domains of female sexuality (desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, pain). RESULTS: A total of 38 patients were included. We also enrolled 35 women as healthy controls. FSFI score was significantly higher in the healthy controls vs. the cases of RH. In the LPS group, the total score and all the domains of the FSFI were lower in comparison with the healthy controls, whereas three of the six domains (arousal, lubrication, orgasm) and the total score of FSFI were lower in the LPT group if compared with the controls.",

Retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy might be considered as the cause of the functional and morphological changes at the level of microcirculation. The aim of the study was to assess by means of dynamic capillaroscopy the influence of autonomic diabetic nephropathy (CAN) in adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus on capillary blood flow (CBV) in skin microcirculation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 18 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (mean age 15+/-2 years). In 9 of them the diagnosis of CAN was made on the basis of Ewing tests. The control group consisted of 10 healthy persons aged 15+/-1.5 years. CBV was measured in capillars of the nailfold of the fourth finger during rest and after 2 minutes of arterial occlusion (the occlusion pressure - above 20 mmHg systolic blood pressure - was obtained by the occlusion of brachial artery using sphygnomanometer cuff). RESULTS: The resting CBV did not differ between patients with CAN, without CAN and healthy controls (0.39+/-0.06, 0.41+0.05 i 0.42+/-0.07). The values of the peak CBV significantly differ between the examined groups (CAN: 0.75+0.1; without CAN: 0.86+/-0.11; control group: 0.98+/-0.09, p<0.01).",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 1681 polyps in 494 patients were categorized as advanced adenomas (villous component or severe dysplasia or early cancer) or insignificant polyps. Chi-squared tests were used to analyze whether polyp histological type could be predicted based on patient age (<60 vs.>or = 60 years), gender, family history of colon polyps or cancer, presence of anemia, polyp size (<or = 5 mm vs.>10 mm), and location (left- vs. right-sided). RESULTS: Insignificant polyp histology (n = 1337) correlated with patient age<60 years (P = 0.0026), lack of anemia (P<0.0001), polyp size<or = 5 mm (P<0.0001), and right-sided location (P= 0.0058). Stepwise inclusion of these parameters demonstrated that the association of a<or = 5 mm right-sided polyp in a patient<60 years yielded the highest combined predictive value (96.2%) for an insignificant polyp.

Most studies have focused on the influence of individual and organizational factors on an employee's intention to quit. Inspired by the observation that providing care is based on the duration of practices, tasks and processes (issues of time) rather than exchange values (wages), this paper focuses on the influence of working-time characteristics and wages on an employee's intention to stay. METHODS: Using data from the WageIndicator web survey (N\u2009=\u20095,323), three logistic regression models were used to estimate health care employee's intention to stay for Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. The first model includes working-time characteristics controlling for a set of sociodemographic variables, job categories, promotion and organization-related characteristics. The second model tests the impact of wage-related characteristics. The third model includes both working-time- and wage-related aspects. RESULTS: Model 1 reveals that working-time-related factors significantly affect intention to stay across all countries. In particular, working part-time hours, overtime and a long commuting time decrease the intention to stay with the same employer. The analysis also shows that job dissatisfaction is a strong predictor for the intention to leave, next to being a woman, being moderately or well educated, and being promoted in the current organization. In Model 2, wage-related characteristics demonstrate that employees with a low wage or low wage satisfaction are less likely to express an intention to stay. The effect of wage satisfaction is not surprising; it confirms that besides a high wage, wage satisfaction is essential. When considering all factors in Model 3, all effects remain significant, indicating that attention to working and commuting times can complement attention to wages and wage satisfaction to increase employees' intention to stay. These findings hold for all three countries, for a variety of health occupations.",

METHOD: Among the offenders who were sentenced to undergo treatment at the National Institute of Forensic Psychiatry, Gongju, Korea, for committing filicide or attempting filicide during 1987 to 2006, 45 women were selected whose final diagnoses at discharge were major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder based on DSM-III-R and DSM-IV criteria. Retrospective medical chart review was performed, mainly focusing on the prevalence rate of bipolar depression, including the rate of diagnostic change during admission. We also investigated the characteristic symptoms of depressive episodes that could predict bipolar disorder. RESULTS: At admission, in only 24.4% of the patients (N = 11) was bipolar disorder diagnosed. However, on the basis of diagnosis at discharge, a bipolar disorder prevalence rate of 73.3% (N = 33) was found. Of the patients with major depressive disorder at admission, 64.7% (N = 22) were subsequently reclassified as having bipolar disorder based on newly observed hypomanic or manic episodes during the admission period. The significant (p<.05) depressive symptoms at the time of filicide that could predict bipolar depression were the presence of postpartum-onset depression (95% CI = 1.45 to 160.88), psychotic symptoms (95% CI = 1.94 to 215.81), and nonaltruistic motivation for filicide (95% CI = 1.45 to 160.88).",

The function of HyPRPs remains unclear, but their widespread occurrence and abundant expression patterns indicate that they may be involved in a basic cellular process. METHODS: To elucidate the cellular function of HyPRPs, we modulated the expression of three HyPRP genes in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) BY-2 cell lines and in potato (Solanum tuberosum) plants. KEY RESULTS: In BY-2 lines, over-expression of the three HyPRP genes with different types of N-terminal domains resulted in similar phenotypic changes, namely increased cell elongation, both in suspension culture and on solid media where the over-expression resulted in enhanced calli size. The over-expressing cells showed increased plasmolysis in a hypertonic mannitol solution and accelerated rate of protoplast release, suggesting loosening of the cell walls. In contrast to BY-2 lines, no phenotypic changes were observed in potato plants over-expressing the same or analogous HyPRP genes, presumably due to more complex compensatory mechanisms in planta.",

In Kenya, ER/PR/HER2 for breast cancers is not part of routine assessment and available in only three to four centers across the country. Variability in methodology and interpretation makes comparison between data difficult. Our aim was to accurately determine the prevalence of ER/PR/HER2 using standardized techniques and double reporting. Prognostic tumor parameters were also correlated with clinical features and receptor status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive invasive breast cancers (IBC) accrued between September 2011 and December 2012 were analyzed at Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi (AKUHN). Tumor blocks were stained for ER/PR/HER2 on an automated platform. Double reporting of ER/PR/HER2 was done using the Allred system and the ASCO/CAP guidelines respectively. RESULTS: A total of 301 cases of IBC were analyzed for pathology and ER/PR/HER2. The age range of patients was 19-94 years with a median of 47.5 years.

More recently exposure to crystalline silica has been suggested as another contributing factor. METHODS: We used data of indoor benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and silica level and lung cancer mortality at the communal level from previous reports to discuss etiological hypotheses on the lung cancer epidemics in XuanWei County. RESULTS: We estimated that PAH exposure as measured by benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) can explain a significant part of the excess risk but not fully (Odd Ratio (OR)   3 as compared to an observed OR = 8 for smoky coal users versus smokeless coal users). This leaves open the possibility of other contributing exposures. Exposure to crystalline silica however would likely only result in an increased risk (OR) of less than 1.5 and as such silica seems not to be the main exposure of interest. However, this does not exclude that risks are present because of the specific physic-chemical characteristics of the silica in smoky coal or that there is an interaction between silica and PAH exposures.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Patients with an accessory pathway (AP) have an increased propensity to develop atrial fibrillation (AF), but the mechanism is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify crucial risk factors and to test the hypothesis that reflection and/or microreentry of atrial impulses propagating into the AP triggers AF. METHODS: Five hundred thirty-four patients successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation of AP at two university hospitals were evaluated. Patients were separated into those with concealed vs those with manifest AP in terms of their propensity to develop AF. To investigate AF triggering mechanisms, linear and branched two-dimensional models of atrium-to-ventricle propagation across a heterogeneous 1 x 6 AP using human ionic kinetics were simulated. RESULTS: A history of AF was twice as common in patients with manifest AP vs concealed AP irrespective of AP location. AF was more likely to occur in older males and in patients with larger atria. There was no correlation between AF history and AP refractory measures. However, the electrophysiologic properties of APs seemed to fulfill the prerequisites for reflection and/or microreentry of atrially initiated impulses. In the linear AP model, repetitive atrial stimulation resulted in progressively larger delay of atrium-to-ventricle propagation across the passive segment. Eventually, sufficient time for repolarization of the atrial segment allowed for reflection of an impulse that activated the entire atrium and by wavefront-wavetail interaction with a new atrial stimulus AF reentry was initiated. Simulations using the branched model showed that microreentry at the ventricular insertion of the AP could also initiate AF via retrograde atrial activation as a result of unidirectional block at the AP-ventricular junction.",
        "output": "The results of this study suggest that APs in patients with manifest AP are more likely to be conducive to AF initiation. This is due to the presence of a conduction delay in the AP that allows for reflection and/or microreentry of atrial impulses."

        "input": "INTRODUCTION: Febrile infants<3 months of age have a greater risk for serious bacterial infection (SBI). The risk is inversely correlated with age. Most protocols recommend admitting to hospital all febrile infants<28 days of age. However, as the prevalence of SBI is not homogenous in this age group, some authors have considered decreasing this cut-off age, allowing ambulatory management of selected patients meeting low-risk criteria. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether 15 days is a suitable cut-off age for different approaches to the management of infants with fever. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional descriptive study of infants<3 months of age with fever without a source seen between September 1, 2003 and August 30, 2010 in the pediatric emergency department of a tertiary teaching hospital. All infants<3 months of age with fever without a source (\u2264 38 \u00b0C) were included. The following data were collected: age, sex, temperature, diagnosis, management in pediatric emergency department, and outcome. RESULTS: Data were collected for 1575 infants; of whom, 311 (19.7%, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 17.7-21.7) were found to have an SBI. The rate of SBI in the patients who were 15 to 21 days of age was 33.3% (95% CI: 23.7%-42.9%), similar to that among infants who were 7 to 14 days of age (31.9%, 95% CI: 21.1%-42.7%) and higher than among those older than 21 days of age (18.3%, 95% CI: 16.3-20.3%).",

METHODS: A core curriculum of BCS was proposed and involved 52 procedures/skills. An electronic BCS database was developed utilizing HanDBase software and then placed on a PDA (Palm) and distributed to 25 third-year medical students randomly as they entered their clinical year. Students logged their skill encounters for 9 months and then electronically transferred the database by e-mail. RESULTS: Students participated in 1,115 procedural/skill encounters (range 17 to 90; median 41; average 44.6). Of the 52 core BCS, all students performed 10. Fewer than 50% of students had any exposure to very common skills. Thirty-four percent of skill encounters occurred at a county hospital, 19% at a clinic, 10% at a university hospital, 10% at a private hospital, 7% at a VA hospital, 4% at a children's hospital, and 16% at miscellaneous locations.",
        "output": "The results of this study demonstrate that junior medical students have limited exposure to BCS. This study provides a baseline for future studies to determine the effectiveness of BCS curricula."

        "input": "OBJECTIVES: The aims were to evaluate the profile of newly diagnosed adult asthma cases and the approach adopted to the secondary care management at the launch of the Finnish asthma programme in 1994 and seven years later, in 2001. METHODS: A retrospective medical record audit was made of non-acutely referred patients with asthma in 1994 (n=165) and in 2001 (n=133). Clinical profile data, numbers of out-patient visits and periods of in-patient care before and after asthma diagnosis were gathered from referral letters and secondary care records. RESULTS: The newly diagnosed asthma patients in 2001 were older, more obese and had more co-morbidities. The main asthma symptoms, such as dyspnoea, wheezing and cough, occurred equally in both years but were more often periodic than daily in 2001. Wheezing during auscultation was significantly less common in 2001. The diagnostic process was associated to a history of asthma in first-degree relatives (OR 5.34, 95% CI 1.12-24.49) in 1994 and a visit to a nurse prior to that to a physician (OR 3.13, 95% CI 1.17-8.37) in 2001. Secondary care visits per new case of asthma (7.3 in 1994 vs. 5.4 in 2001) and days in hospital (3.6 in 1994 vs. 0.95 in 2001) decreased significantly.",

We thus explored whether serum visfatin could be used as a potential diagnostic and prognostic tool for PBC, taking into account clinicopathological features, serum tumor markers, anthropometric and metabolic parameters. METHODS: Serum visfatin, tumor marker CA 15-3, carcinoembryonic antigen, metabolic and anthropometric parameters were determined in 103 postmenopausal women with pathologically confirmed, incident invasive breast cancer, 103 controls matched on age and time of diagnosis, and 51 patients with benign breast lesions (BBL). RESULTS: Mean serum visfatin was significantly higher in cases than in controls and patients with BBL (p<0.001). In cases, visfatin was significantly associated with CA 15-3 (p=0.03), hormone-receptor status (p<0.001), lymph node invasion (p=0.06) but not with metabolic and anthropometric variables (p>0.05). Multivariable regression analysis revealed that absence of estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER-PR-) was the strongest significant determinant of serum visfatin (p<0.001) in cases adjusting for demographic, metabolic and clinicopathological features. Based upon receiver operator characteristic analysis, serum visfatin outperformed CA 15-3 only in discriminating between PBC cases with early cancer stage than those with late stage, and in differentiating particularly patients with ER-PR- breast tumors.",

However, public sector mental health services and private psychiatrists do not always work well together and there seem to be a number of barriers to effective collaboration. This study set out to investigate the extent of collaborative 'shared care' arrangements between a public mental health service and private psychiatrists practising nearby. It also examined possible barriers to collaboration and some possible solutions to the identified problems. METHOD: A questionnaire examining the above factors was sent to all public sector mental health clinicians and all private psychiatrists in the area. RESULTS: One hundred and five of the 154 (68.2%) public sector clinicians and 103 of the 194 (53.1%) private psychiatrists returned surveys. The main barriers to successful collaboration identified by members of both sectors were: 'Difficulty communicating' endorsed by 71.4% of public clinicians and 72% of private psychiatrists, 'Confusion of roles and responsibilities' endorsed by 62.9% and 66%, respectively, and 'Different treatment approach' by 47.6% and 45.6%, respectively. Over 60% of private psychiatrists identified problems with access to the public system as a barrier to successful shared care arrangements. It also emerged, as hypothesized, that the public and private systems tend to manage different patient populations and that public clinicians in particular are not fully aware of the private psychiatrists' range of expertise. This would result in fewer referrals for shared care across the sectors.",

In ImRS exercises, patients sometimes suggest taking violent revenge on perpetrators. However, it is unclear whether vengeful phantasies can be particularly helpful in giving back feelings of power and control, or whether they rather increase aggressive feelings, with potentially harmful effects. METHODS: Forty-six healthy participants watched 3 trauma movie segments depicting interpersonal violence. After each movie, one of 3 ImRS strategies (ImRS with violent revenge, ImRS without violence, safe place imagery) was applied. Dependent variables were subjective emotion ratings. RESULTS: Aggressive and positive emotions changed most strongly with the safe place image, no differences between ImRS with and without violence were observed. Sad and anxious emotions were not differently influenced by different strategies. LIMITATIONS: Only a healthy sample with no previous display of aggression has been investigated. Cross-over effects cannot be excluded due to the within-group design with repeated trauma movie segments.",

Modern ultrasound systems now use harmonic imaging (HI) because of the improved LV endomyocardial definition. However, the 2005 American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) recommendations noted that the applicability of the reference values to HI-derived measurements has not been established. METHODS: LVM and LV end-diastolic volume, diameter, and wall thickness were determined using HI in healthy subjects (n = 251), including normal-weight (NW) (body mass index<25 kg/m\u00b2, n = 149, 68% women) and otherwise healthy, overweight (OW) (body mass index \u2265 25 and<30 kg/m\u00b2, n = 102, 41% women) groups. Measurements were compared with ASE-endorsed reference values. The agreement between FI and HI was determined in a prospective cohort of 51 subjects. RESULTS: Two-dimensional (2D) derived LV volumes were similar between NW and OW subjects, although M-mode (MM)-derived LV diameters were slightly greater in OW subjects. 2D and MM-derived LVM was greater in OW compared with NW subjects, including after adjustment by height or height\u00b2\u00b7\u2077; however, indexing to body surface area eliminated these differences. The partition values for abnormal 2D and MM-derived LVM were generally greater in NW and OW subjects of both sexes compared with the ASE-endorsed values (except MM-derived LVM in NW men). However, there were no significant differences in LVM determined by HI compared with FI in a prospectively studied cohort.",

RESULTS: Thirty-four patients were identified as delirious and 95 as anaemic according to the WHO criteria. Stepwise logistic regression revealed that anaemia (haemoglobin level<12 g/l in women and<13 g/l in men), male sex and a diagnosis of dementia were independent risk factors for delirium in the total study group. After adjustment for sex, age, diagnosis of dementia and dehydration, the odds ratio (OR) for anaemia (2.4; 95 CI = 1.02-5.54) remained significantly associated with delirium. When the study population was classified in groups according to sex, anaemia remained a significant risk factor for delirium in men (OR = 3.7; 95% CI = 1.03-15.6) after adjustment for the multiple variables but not in women (OR = 1.54; 95% CI = 0.48-4.9).

Impacted stones are often considered a contraindication to in-situ SWL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Impaction in our study was defined as failure to visualize the ureter distal to the calculus with proximal hold-up of contrast for as long as 3 hours on an intravenous urogram (IVU). We evaluated 30 patients with impacted ureteral calculi, who were compared with a second unimpacted group matched for stone size and stone location. The calculi were reorganized into<or =10-mm and>10-mm groups. The results were compared in terms of clearance rates, number of shockwaves, number of sessions, and number of days between the start of SWL and clearance. RESULTS: Between January 1998 and December 2001, 30 impacted stones were treated with lithotripsy. Complete clearance rates in the impacted as well as the non-impacted group were 76.7%. There was no statistical difference in the number of shockwaves, sessions, or time to clearance. The results were poorer in lower-ureteral than upper-ureteral calculi, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. However, the differences between the<or =10-mm and>10-mm stones were statistically significant.",

Upon reentry to the community, concerns regarding smoking cessation may be less likely to receive needed attention. Many individuals have partners who are pregnant and/or reside in households where children and pregnant women live. We explored incarcerated adults' attitudes of smoking in the presence of children and pregnant women and how post-release smoking behaviors are influenced by their attitudes. METHODS: Two hundred forty-seven incarcerated adults participated in a smoking cessation randomized clinical trial in a tobacco-free prison. An instrument was developed to examine smoking attitudes and behaviors around children and pregnant women. Moderating effects of smoking factors on post-release abstinence were examined by evaluating interactions between smoking factors and treatment group. RESULTS: Four factors were defined using factor analysis: smoking around children; impact of smoking on child's health; awareness of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) risk for pregnant women; and importance of smoking avoidance during pregnancy. We found moderation effects of smoking factors on smoking outcomes which included: treatment group by smoking behavior around children (\u03b2 = 0.8085; standard error [SE] = 0.4002; P = .04); treatment group by impact of smoking on child's health (\u03b2 = 1.2390; SE = 0.5632; P = .03) and for those smoking 50% fewer cigarettes post-release, treatment group by smoking impact on child's health (\u03b2 = 1.2356; SE = 0.4436; P<.01).",

We conducted a meta-analysis of the predictive value of MTWA screening for ventricular arrhythmic events in primary prevention patients with left ventricular dysfunction and examined whether results differed depending upon whether beta-blocker use was withheld prior to MTWA testing. METHODS AND RESULTS: Prospective studies that evaluated whether MTWA predicted ventricular arrhythmic events published between January 1980 and September 2008 were identified. Summary estimates for the predictive value of MTWA were derived with random-effects models. Nine studies involving 3,939 patients were identified. Overall, an abnormal MTWA (positive and indeterminate) test was associated with an almost 2-fold increased risk for arrhythmic events (pooled RR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.29-2.96; P = 0.002). However, significant heterogeneity across studies was observed (P = 0.024). In the 4 studies in which beta-blocker therapy was not withheld prior to MTWA assessment, an abnormal MTWA test was associated with a 5-fold increased risk for arrhythmic events (pooled RR = 5.39, 95% CI: 2.68-10.84; P<0.001) and was robust to sensitivity analyses.

This hypothesis may suggest a beneficial effect of antibiotics in CD therapy. So far, guidelines do not recommend antibiotics except in the treatment of complicated CD, and there are few studies on the effects of rifaximin in these patients. METHODS: Between December 2011 and December 2012, we performed a blinded randomized trial in 168 patients with a previous history of moderately active CD concerning the efficacy of rifaximin. All the patients had previously achieved remission with standard therapy (prednisone/budesonide). Data from patients receiving 800 mg of rifaximin (83 patients) twice a day for 12 weeks were compared with those from patients who received placebo (83 patients). The primary endpoint was maintaining remission during the follow-up. RESULTS: All the patients (100%; 83/83) on 800 mg of rifaximin were in remission after 12 weeks of treatment in comparison with 84% (70/83) of the placebo group. This significant difference was also persistent at the 24-week follow-up [78% (65/83) vs. 41% (34/83), respectively].

In couples with both partners positive, qualitative detection of serum HCV RNA and genotyping were performed. RESULTS: The prevalence among spouses was 10.3% (32/311). The mean age was higher for HCV-positive spouses (57.7 vs 49.6 yr for HCV-negative spouses; p<0.01). The prevalence among spouses increased with the duration of marriage, whereas no difference was found in relation to the clinical status of the index case. The 32 HCV-positive spouses reported parenteral exposure (blood transfusion, drug use, and use of multiple-use glass syringes inside or outside the family) more often than the 279 HCV-negative spouses (84.4% vs 26.2%; odds ratio [OR], adjusted for age by multiple logistic regression analysis, 12.4; 95% CI = 4.5-34.0). The percentage of couples sharing glass syringes was significantly higher among those with both partners infected (65.6% vs 12.9%; OR = 12.9; 95% CI = 5.4-31.4). Qualitative serum HCV RNA was determined in 22 couples with both partners infected; in 13 of them, both partners were HCV RNA positive, whereas in the remaining nine couples, only one partner was HCV RNA positive.",
        "output": "The prevalence of HCV infection among spouses is high. The transmission of HCV between spouses is likely to occur through parenteral exposure, especially through the sharing of glass syringes."

        "input": "OBJECTIVES: High TSH levels often observed in overweight subjects are associated with metabolic risk. Thyroid hormones which are involved in fat and carbohydrates metabolism are more rarely studied; their blood levels were measured to more precisely explain the relationships between thyroid function and obesity, in healthy overweight youth. This correlation was studied at baseline and during follow-up of some patients.MATERIALS/ METHODS: Data collected were BMI and BMI z score, thyroid hormones (TSH, fT4, fT3), fasting blood glucose, HOMA-IR, lipids (triglycerides, HDL and LDL cholesterol), transaminase activity, fibrinogen, leptin, IGF-I; body composition (biphotonic absorptiometry). Data collected in a sample of the group after 6-18 months of medical intervention could also be studied. RESULTS: At baseline, 13% of the 528 obese subjects (55% girls; 11.3\u00b12.4 years, range 4.1-17.9; BMI z score: 5.4\u00b12.4) had TSH>4mUI/l; fT3 levels were associated with age and transaminase activity; using multivariate regression analysis, with z-score and age as covariates, fT4 showed correlations with TSH, insulin, HOMA IR, blood lipids, and fibrinogen. No correlations were found with leptin, iodine excretion, IGF-I.In 79 patients followed for 52\u00b115 wk (45% girls; age range 8-18.3 years), univariate regression showed a positive correlation between changes in TSH and HOMA-IR, and between changes in fT4 and HDL. Multivariate regression showed that changes in TSH and fT4 were associated with changes in HOMA-IR, and changes in fT4 with changes in HDL.",

        "input": "INTRODUCTION: The main principles of obesity treatment are dietetic nutrition, physical activity and psychotherapy. Drug therapy is adjuvant, time limited and can be applied only with the mentioned therapeutic measures. An ideal antiadipose agent induces a potent decrease of body mass on the account of fat depot, it can be administered for a prolonged time without developing resistance, it should not be accompanied by significant side effects, and it has no negative effects on the obesity-related diseases. ANTI- OBESITY AGENTS: Nowadays, there are mainly two groups of drugs in use, having different mechanisms of action: appetite suppressors and fat resorption inhibitors. From the first group of drugs the most suitable is dexfenfluramine, which is applied in obese nervous and tense subjects and in cases of compulsive food intake whereas fat resorption inhibitors (tetrahydrolipstatin, orlistat) are especially recommended to obese patients with accompanying hyperlipoproteinemia. Insulin-dependent form of diabetes is an indication for administration of drugs from this group.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Preservation of spontaneous breathing (SB) is sometimes debated because it has potentially both negative and positive effects on lung injury in comparison with fully controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV). We wanted (1) to verify in mechanically ventilated patients if the change in transpulmonary pressure was similar between pressure support ventilation (PSV) and CMV for a similar tidal volume, (2) to estimate the influence of SB on alveolar pressure (Palv), and (3) to determine whether a reliable plateau pressure could be measured during pressure support ventilation (PSV). METHODS: We studied ten patients equipped with esophageal catheters undergoing three levels of PSV followed by a phase of CMV. For each condition, we calculated the maximal and mean transpulmonary (\u0394PL) swings and Palv. RESULTS: Overall, \u0394PL was similar between CMV and PSV, but only loosely correlated. The differences in \u0394PL between CMV and PSV were explained largely by different inspiratory flows, indicating that the resistive pressure drop caused this difference. By contrast, the Palv profile was very different between CMV and SB; SB led to progressively more negative Palv during inspiration, and Palv became lower than the set positive end-expiratory pressure in nine of ten patients at low PSV. Finally, inspiratory occlusion holds performed during PSV led to plateau and \u0394 PL pressures comparable with those measured during CMV.",
        "output": "The results of this study suggest that the effects of SB on lung mechanics are similar to those of CMV, and that the use of PSV may be beneficial in preserving lung function."

In England, a new national 3-day training programme called 'Connected' has been developed and is now mandatory for all cancer and palliative care professionals. This study aimed to explore the attitudes of staff in one region to undertaking this training. METHODS AND SAMPLE: A survey questionnaire was developed through a series of discussions with experts and semi-structured interviews with five healthcare professionals. The questionnaire was distributed to 200 cancer and palliative care staff; 109 were completed and returned. KEY RESULTS: There were significant differences between doctors' and nurses' attitudes to communication skills training, with doctors demonstrating more negative attitudes. More nurses than doctors felt that communication skills training should be mandatory for cancer and palliative care professionals (p \u2264 0.001), whilst more doctors felt that these staff should already be skilled communicators and not require further training (p \u2264 0.001). Nurses also self-rated their communication skills more highly than doctors.",

The aim of this paper is to assess smoking behaviour of non-responders in an evaluation of the Swedish national tobacco cessation quitline a nation-wide, free of charge service. METHODS: A telephone interview survey with a sample of people not participating in the original follow-up. The study population comprised callers to the Swedish quitline who had consented to participate in a 12 month follow-up but had failed to respond. A sample of 84 (18% of all non-responders) was included. The main outcome measures were self-reported smoking behaviour at the time of the interview and at the time of the routine follow-up. Also, reasons for not responding to the original follow-up questionnaire were assessed. For statistical comparison between groups we used Fischer's exact test, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) on proportions and OR. RESULTS: Thirty-nine percent reported to have been smoke-free at the time they received the original questionnaire compared with 31% of responders in the original study population. The two most common reasons stated for not having returned the original questionnaire was claiming that they had returned it (35%) and that they had not received the questionnaire (20%). Non-responders were somewhat younger and were to a higher degree smoke-free when they first called the quitline.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Obstetric palsy is the injury of the brachial plexus during delivery. Although many infants with plexopathy recover with minor or no residual functional deficits, some children don't regain sufficient limb function because of functional limitations, bony deformities and joint contractures. Shoulder is the most frequently affected joint with internal rotation contracture causing limitation of abduction, external rotation. The treatment comprises muscle release procedures such as posterior subscapularis sliding or anterior subscapularis tendon lengthening and muscle transfers to restore the missing external rotation and abduction function. METHODS: We evaluated whether the preoperative abduction degree affects functional outcome. Between 1998 and 2002, 46 children were operated on to restore shoulder abduction and external rotation. The average age at surgery was 7.6 years and average follow up was 40.8 months. We compared the postoperative results of the patients who had preoperative abduction less than 90 degrees (Group I: n = 37) with the patients who had preoperative abduction greater than 90 degrees (Group II: n = 9), in terms of abduction and external rotation function with angle measurements and Mallet classification. We inquired whether patients in Group I needed another muscle transfer along with latissimus dorsi and teres major transfers. RESULTS: In Group I the average abduction improved from 62.5 degrees to 131.4 degrees (a 68.9 degrees +/- 22.9 degrees gain) and the average external rotation improved from 21.4 degrees to 82.6 degrees (a 61.1 degrees +/- 23 degrees gain). In Group II the average abduction improved from 99.4 degrees to 140 degrees (a 40.6 degrees +/- 22.3 degrees gain) and the average external rotation improved from 21.4 degrees to 82.6 degrees (a 61.1 degrees +/- 23 degrees gain). The average abduction gain in Group I was significantly greater than that in Group II (p = 0.001). The average external rotation gain in Group I was significantly greater than that in Group II (p = 0.001).

This paired approach may not always be possible. We simulated whether F and the absorption rate constant (ka) could be estimated accurately for a drug with low variance using different patients for nonintravenous and intravenous routes and whether sparse sampling permitted accurate estimates. METHODS: Using pharmacokinetic parameters for cisatracurium besylate (INN, cisatracurium besilate), we simulated data sets representing 20 administrations (10 intravenous and 10 nonintravenous) with either three (sparse) or 16 (extensive) samples per administration. Simulations were performed twice, with ka values of 0.1 (slow absorption) or 0.3 (rapid absorption) min-1. With use of NONMEM, we estimated F and ka for each data set using both two-stage and mixed-effects modeling approaches and paired and unpaired designs to determine the percentage of estimates that deviated>25% from the simulated value. RESULTS: Estimates of F with extensive data were satisfactory for all approaches. With sparse sampling, two-stage analysis of unpaired data were not possible, two-stage analysis of paired data yielded erroneous estimates, and mixed-effects modeling gave satisfactory estimates. Estimates of ka were sometimes erroneous with all approaches except for paired analysis of extensive data with slow absorption; sparse data and two-stage analysis increased the likelihood of errors compared with extensive data and mixed-effects modeling.",

We theorized that personality measures of depression, anxiety, hostility, social isolation, and substance abuse would predict CHD development in psychiatric inpatients. METHOD: We used a longitudinal database of psychological test data from 349 Veterans first admitted to a psychiatric unit between October 1, 1983, and September 30, 1987. Veterans Affairs and national databases were assessed to determine the development of new-onset chronic CHD over the intervening 16-year period. RESULTS: New-onset CHD developed in 154 of the 349 (44.1%) subjects. Thirty-one psychometric variables from five personality tests significantly predicted the development of CHD. We performed a factor analysis of these variables because they overlapped and four factors emerged, with positive adaptive functioning the only significant factor (OR=0.798, p=0.038).",

California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) have experienced recurrent outbreaks of leptospirosis since 1970, but it is unknown whether the pathogen persists in the sea lion population or is introduced repeatedly from external reservoirs. METHODS: We analyzed serum samples collected over an 11-year period from 1344 California sea lions that stranded alive on the California coast, using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) for antibodies to Leptospira interrogans serovar Pomona. We evaluated seroprevalence among yearlings as a measure of incidence in the population, and characterized antibody persistence times based on temporal changes in the distribution of titer scores. We conducted multinomial logistic regression to determine individual risk factors for seropositivity with high and low titers. RESULTS: The serosurvey revealed cyclical patterns in seroprevalence to L. interrogans serovar Pomona, with 4-5 year periodicity and peak seroprevalence above 50%. Seroprevalence in yearling sea lions was an accurate index of exposure among all age classses, and indicated on-going exposure to leptospires in non-outbreak years. Analysis of titer decay rates showed that some individuals probably maintain high titers for more than a year following exposure.",

The results of research done over the past three decades have shown that the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has an inhibitory effect on fracture repair, but the exact mechanism of action remains to be elucidated. Cancer research has identified that NSAIDs impede cell proliferation by inhibiting angiogenesis. It is proposed that a similar mechanism occurs in the induction of NSAID-induced nonunions. This hypothesis was investigated in a randomized placebo-controlled trial of the NSAID rofecoxib with use of a murine femoral fracture model. METHODS: Two hundred and forty mice were randomized to receive either the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug rofecoxib (5 mg/kg orally) in a 0.5% methylcellulose solution (the NSAID group) or the 0.5% methylcellulose solution only (the control group). Two hundred and thirty-five of the 240 mice underwent surgery to induce an open transverse middiaphyseal femoral fracture, which was then treated with use of a custom-made external fixator. Five additional animals underwent sham surgery with no fracture induced. Outcomes measures included radiographic assessment, histologic analysis, biomechanical testing, and use of laser Doppler flowmetry to assess blood flow across the fracture gap. RESULTS: Radiography revealed similar healing patterns in both groups; however, at the later stages (day 32), the NSAID group had poorer healing. Histological analysis demonstrated that the control animals healed quicker (at days 24 and 32) than the NSAID group. Biomechanical testing showed that the NSAID group had significantly lower stiffness and strength than the control group. Laser Doppler flowmetry showed that the NSAID group had significantly lower blood flow across the fracture gap than the control group.",

The present study sought to determine whether endogenous FGF-2 was associated with retinoscleral signalling or scleral remodelling during changes in refractive error in a mammalian model of myopia. METHODS: Myopia was induced in tree shrews over a 5-day period. One group of animals was then allowed 3 days of recovery from the induced myopia. Endogenous levels of FGF-2 were measured in scleral and retinal homogenates using ELISA. Real-time PCR was used to investigate scleral FGF-2 and FGF receptor (FGFR)-1 mRNA expression. RESULTS: No difference in FGF-2 content was found in posterior scleral or retinal extracts of myopic eyes (scleral -4+/-9%, retinal +23+/-17%) or recovering eyes (scleral -10+/-18%, retinal +1+/-13%), when compared with contralateral control eyes. In addition, no significant changes were found in scleral FGF-2 mRNA expression in myopic or recovering eyes (+106+/-56% and +14+/-12% respectively, P=0.21). However, FGF-2 concentration was significantly higher in anterior, relative to posterior, scleral regions in all animals (1602+/-105 vs 1030+/-50pg/mg respectively P<0.001).

Few studies have been performed using effusion samples from animals. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to determine whether LDH can be used to differentiate between transudative and exudative effusions in dogs and cats (including postmortem samples), and whether there is a difference between different laboratory methods of LDH measurement. METHODS: Lactate dehydrogenase activity was measured in canine and feline effusions that were submitted to the Murdoch University Veterinary Hospital Clinical Pathology Laboratory over approximately 12 months using 2 wet and one dry chemistry methods, including 10 effusions collected postmortem. Results were compared to classification using traditional methods for effusion types. RESULTS: Lactate dehydrogenase activity was significantly higher in exudates than in transudates, significantly different depending on the method of measurement, and significantly higher in all effusions collected postmortem. An LDH effusion:serum ratio of<0.5 was associated with transudates. There was no significant difference between samples collected into EDTA or plain serum tubes, in frozen and thawed samples, or after storage at 4\u00b0C for 3-7 days.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: The early risk of stroke after transient ischemic attack (TIA)/stroke is of the order of 5-10% at 1 week and 10-20% at 3 months. Even if carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is the treatment of choice in symptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis, the timing of carotid intervention after acute stroke is not yet codified. The authors want to determinate whether early CEA is safely carried out in the first few hours (<48 hours) successive to the nondebilitating neurological event and whether the outcome (TIA/stroke/death) in these cases is comparable with the results of those treated by delayed/deferred surgery (range, 48 hours-24 weeks). METHODS: In 4 years, the authors performed 1,184 CEA (285 symptomatic). Five groups were formed from 285 symptomatic patients, according to interval between TIA/stroke onset and performance of CEA: G1, less than 48 hours; G2, 48 hours-2 weeks; G3, 2-4 weeks; G4, 4-8 weeks; G5, 8-24 weeks. Surgery was never performed on patients with disabling neurological deficit (modified Rankin Scale, 5) at the time of admittance, cerebral lesions greater than 3 cm at magnetic resonance/computed tomography scan, presence or suspect of parenchymal hemorrhage associated with ischemic damage, condition considered unfit for surgery (American Society of Anesthesiology classification grade V), and occlusion of the cerebral middle artery. Neurological and diagnostic examinations (duplex-scanning and computed tomography/magnetic resonance scan) were used in determining the selection for early CEA. RESULTS: The 5 groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, and risk factors. The 5 groups were also comparable in terms of the number of patients with TIA/stroke (G1, 14.2%; G2, 14.2%; G3, 14.2%; G4, 14.2%; G5, 14.2%), stroke (G1, 1.6%; G2, 1.6%; G3, 1.6%; G4, 1.6%; G5, 1.6%), and death (G1, 0.8%; G2, 0.8%; G3, 0.8%; G4, 0.8%; G5, 0.8%).",

Analysis of the magnitude of the average fluctuation of a person's systolic blood pressure around his or her age-adjusted trend line, however, shows moderate, albeit significant, family resemblance in Cohort 1 of the Framingham Heart Study. To determine whether genomic regions affecting this phenotype could be identified, we pursued a \"model-free\" multipoint quantitative linkage analysis.

Well-constructed MCQs follow rules, which ensure that a question tests what it is intended to test. Questions that break these are described as \"flawed.\" We examined whether the prevalence of flawed questions differed significantly between those with or without prior training in question writing and between those with different levels of educator experience. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed 200 unedited MCQs from a question bank for our senior medical student radiology elective: an equal number of questions (50) were written by faculty with previous training in MCQ writing, other faculty, residents, and medical students. Questions were scored independently by two readers for the presence of 11 distinct flaws described in the literature. RESULTS: Questions written by faculty with MCQ writing training had significantly fewer errors: mean 0.4 errors per question compared to a mean of 1.5-1.7 errors per question for the other groups (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). There were no significant differences in the total number of errors between the untrained faculty, residents, and students (P values .35-.91).

        "input": "PURPOSE: Most pediatric treatment protocols specify dose calculations for cytostatic drugs based on body-surface area (BSA). However, for children less than 1 year of age, calculation guidelines vary. Normally, reduced dosages are recommended with calculations based on body weight (BW). However, the optimal dose for infants should take age-dependent and drug-specific pharmacokinetic parameters into account. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The current investigation focused on the effects of different dose-reduction rules on the steady-state levels (Css) of etoposide and related bone marrow toxicity. One hundred seventy three treatment courses in 78 children on a 96-hour continuous infusion schedule were monitored for Css (determined by high-performance liquid chromatography [HPLC]), and 100 courses were documented in detail with regard to dose calculation (125 mg/m2, 4.17/kg, or 2/3 x 4.17/kg) and toxicity. RESULTS: Dose calculation on the basis of BSA led to Css of 4.9 +/- 1.2 micrograms/mL, which on the basis of BW was 3.5 +/- 1.1 micrograms/mL and 1.95 +/- 0.6 micrograms/mL (2/3.kg-dose), respectively. However, conversion of the latter levels to those expected with the regular square-meter-dose, resulted in values of 4.7 +/- 1.4 micrograms/mL and 4.2 +/- 1.2 micrograms/mL (/125 mg/m2). Lower etoposide Css levels resulted in less pronounced thrombocyte and WBC nadirs in the first 24 hours after treatment.",

Automatic titration is cheaper and more easily available than manual titration. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the effect of automatic titration in identifying a pressure and on the improvement of apnea/hyponea index (AHI) and somnolence, the change of sleep quality, and the acceptance and compliance of CPAP treatment, compared with the manual titration. METHODS: A systematic search was made of the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, SCI, China Academic Journals Full-text Databases, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Chinese Scientific Journals Databases and Chinese Medical Association Journals. Randomized controlled trials comparing automatic titration and manual titration were reviewed. Studies were pooled to yield odds ratios (OR) or mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Ten trials involving 849 patients met the inclusion criteria. It is hard to identify a trend in the pressures determined by either automatic or manual titration.

Acute hypoxia stimulates large increases in serum erythropoietin (EPO), and EPO induces formation of characteristic enlarged red blood cells (RBCs). The presence of large RBCs perturbs red cell distribution width (RDW). METHODS: Using a>2M patient medical claims database, the human pathome was scanned for diseases where RDW rose 0-50days following a new diagnosis. The course of RDW after selected diagnoses was visualized by registering RDW measurements by diagnosis date. RESULTS: Acute hemorrhage, which provokes EPO-driven erythropoiesis, is followed by increases in RDW but not mean cell volume (MCV). Similar RDW increases follow many acute diseases with risk of hypoxia, including heart failure, pneumonia, atelectasis, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, and sepsis. Elevations reach maximum within 1month after onset and subside to pre-disease levels about 6months later. Unlike the case with iron-deficiency anemia (IDA), RDW elevations after hypoxia-associated diseases are unaccompanied by discernible change in average RBC size.",

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: SMT is a common treatment option for LBP. Numerous clinical trials have attempted to evaluate its effectiveness for different subgroups of acute and chronic LBP but the efficacy of maintenance SMT in chronic nonspecific LBP has not been studied. METHODS: Sixty patients, with chronic, nonspecific LBP lasting at least 6 months, were randomized to receive either (1) 12 treatments of sham SMT over a 1-month period, (2) 12 treatments, consisting of SMT over a 1-month period, but no treatments for the subsequent 9 months, or (3) 12 treatments over a 1-month period, along with \"maintenance spinal manipulation\" every 2 weeks for the following 9 months. To determine any difference among therapies, we measured pain and disability scores, generic health status, and back-specific patient satisfaction at baseline and at 1-, 4-, 7-, and 10-month intervals. RESULTS: Patients in second and third groups experienced significantly lower pain and disability scores than first group at the end of 1-month period (P = 0.0027 and 0.0029, respectively).

Patients were assessed with standardized instruments for major symptoms, psychosocial functioning, personality, attitudinal variables, neurocognition and treatment. RESULTS: At each follow-up, 30-40% of SZ patients were no longer on antipsychotics. Starting at the 4.5-year follow-ups and continuing thereafter, SZ patients not on antipsychotics for prolonged periods were significantly less likely to be psychotic and experienced more periods of recovery; they also had more favorable risk and protective factors.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study of infants tested with TEOAE and AABR under a hospital-based universal newborn hearing screening program in Lagos, Nigeria. Maternal and infant factors associated with discordant TEOAE and AABR outcomes were determined with multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusting for potential confounding factors. RESULTS: Of the 4718 infants enrolled under the program 1745 (36.9%) completed both TEOAE and AABR. Of this group, 1060 (60.7%) passed both TEOAE and AABR (\"true-negatives\"); 92 (5.3%) failed both TEOAE and AABR (\"true-positive\"); 571 (32.7%) failed TEOAE but passed AABR (\"false-positives\") while 22 (1.3%) passed TEOAE but failed AABR (\"false-negatives\").

METHODS: Centralized provincial databases of health care usage were used to identify women aged 45 and older who had a pelvic ultrasound examination between 2006 and 2008. Subsequent imaging tests ordered were identified according to physician specialty. For women who proceeded to laparotomy, logistic regression was performed to determine which imaging tests enabled primary physicians to make appropriate referrals of women with high risk adnexal tumours to a gynaecologic oncologist. RESULTS: We identified 193 261 women aged 45 and older who had a pelvic ultrasound. Of these, 19 949 (10.3%) had a subsequent laparotomy; 2223 women were categorized as having a benign adnexal mass, 627 were categorized as having a malignant adnexal mass, and the remainder had another diagnosis such as uterine fibroid. Up to 12% of women had a pelvic MRI, and 58% of women had a CT scan after a pelvic ultrasound. Family physicians referred 95% of women with a high-risk ovarian mass to a gynaecologic surgeon rather than to a gynaecologic oncologist, and gynaecologists referred 47% of such women to a gynaecologic oncologist after imaging. Gynaecologic oncologists operated on 55% of women with a malignant adnexal mass. On multivariate analysis, a preoperative CT scan (odds ratio 1.4, 95% confidence interval 1.2-1.7) and a preoperative MRI (odds ratio 1.3, 95% confidence interval 1.1-1.6) were associated with appropriate referral of women with a high-risk adnexal mass to a gynaecologic oncologist.",

OBJECTIVES: To test the link between periodontal disease in pregnant women and low birth weight or prematurity. METHODS: A population-based, cross-sectional study was carried out in Southern Brazil. The sample consisted of 449 parturients who were interviewed and examined up to 48 h post-partum. Three outcomes were investigated: low birth weight, prematurity and prematurity and/or birth weight. Periodontal disease, the exposure, was defined as (i) at least one site with a periodontal pocket; (ii) the presence of pockets at four or more sites. Socio-demographic information relating to health and maternal habits was collected through a questionnaire and by hospital medical records. Simple and multiple regression analysis was performed. FINDINGS: There was no statistically significant association between periodontal disease and low birth weight. Periodontal pocket was not associated with low birth weight and/or pre-term birth after being adjusted. A periodontal pocket in at least one site was associated with prematurity (odds ratio=2.6; 95% confidence interval 1.0-6.9) even after adjusting for maternal schooling, parity, number of previous children of low birth weight, number of pre-natal consultations and body mass index.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Of 1145 consecutive patients, 846 had pretreatment biopsies allowing for sextant analysis and consequent evaluation of biochemical failure tendencies. Biochemical failure was defined as a posttreatment rise in the nadir prostate-specific antigen (PSA) by at least 2 ng/mL. Patient and tumor characteristics, dosimetry, the use of hormone therapy, source strength, and postimplant PSA kinetics were analyzed between sextant subgroups. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients (7.3%) with sextant pathology had biochemical failure. There was no significant difference between the failure locations. There were 528 patients (62.4%) with some element of base involvement (BI), and 318 patients (37.6%) with no evidence of BI. Of the 62 patients with biochemical failure, 42 (67.7%) showed BI on biopsy and 20 (32.3%) had no BI.

Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified as a having strong association with CD, including SNPs within the autophagy related 4 homolog A (ATG4A) gene and the neutrophil cytosolic factor 4 (NCF4) gene. We hypothesized a possible association between the presence of granulomas in CD patients and variants in the ATG4A and NCF4 genes. AIMS: To investigate whether variants in the NCF4 and ATG4A genes are associated with granuloma formation in a cohort of Israeli patients with CD, exploring demographic and clinical characteristics that differ between granuloma positive and granuloma negative patients. METHODS: 307 Israeli patients with CD were studied. Patients with CD who underwent biopsy or resection of the intestine were classified according to presence or absence of granulomas. Using PCR-RFLP we determined the allele frequency in SNP rs4821544 (NCF4 gene) and SNP rs807185 (ATG4A gene) for all patients. RESULTS: Granulomas were found in 85 out of 307 CD patients (27%). There were no significant differences between patients with or without granulomas in allele frequency in SNPs rs4821544 and rs807185.

        "input": "INTRODUCTION: Kenya is characterized by high unmet need for family planning (FP) and high unplanned pregnancy, in a context of urban population explosion and increased urban poverty. It witnessed an improvement of its FP and reproductive health (RH) indicators in the recent past, after a period of stalled progress. The objectives of the paper are to: a) describe inequities in modern contraceptive use, types of methods used, and the main sources of contraceptives in urban Kenya; b) examine the extent to which differences in contraceptive use between the poor and the rich widened or shrank over time; and c) attempt to relate these findings to the FP programming context, with a focus on whether the services are increasingly reaching the urban poor. METHODS: We use data from the 1993, 1998, 2003 and 2008/09 Kenya demographic and health survey. Bivariate analyses describe the patterns of modern contraceptive use and the types and sources of methods used, while multivariate logistic regression models assess how the gap between the poor and the rich varied over time. The quantitative analysis is complemented by a review on the major FP/RH programs carried out in Kenya. RESULTS: There was a dramatic change in contraceptive use between 2003 and 2008/09 that resulted in virtually no gap between the poor and the rich in 2008/09, by contrast to the period 1993-1998 during which the improvement in contraceptive use did not significantly benefit the urban poor. Indeed, the late 1990s marked the realization by the Government of Kenya and its development partners, of the need to deliberately target the poor with family planning services. Most urban women use short-term and less effective methods, with the proportion of long-acting method users remaining low. The major FP/RH programs in Kenya have been largely successful in increasing access to contraceptives, but have not been able to reach the poor.",
        "output": "The results of this study suggest that the FP/RH programs in Kenya have been successful in increasing access to contraceptives, but have not been able to reach the poor. This is likely due to the fact that the programs have been largely supply-driven, with limited attention to demand-side factors. To bridge the gap between the poor and the rich in contraceptive use, programs should focus on improving access to information and services, and on strengthening demand-side factors such as women's autonomy and empowerment."

METHODS: A total of 3169 TKAs performed between April 2003 and December 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. We determined the prevalence of malnutrition on applying different definitions, with various cutoff values of serum albumin and TLC and analyzed the variations in outcome. The differences between groups with and without malnutrition in terms of functional outcome and complications were determined using Student's t test and analysis of variance. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the independent risk factors.

This study investigates the feasibility of measuring CPPopt in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) by continuously assessing the CVA. METHODS: Twenty-nine aSAH patients were enrolled, and data from CVA status, CPPopt, and periods when CPP was below, within, or above CPPopt were computed daily. Outcome was assessed at 6 months with the Glasgow Outcome Scale. Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze differences in the duration of impaired CVA and duration of CPP below CPPopt in patients with good and poor outcomes. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of outcome. RESULTS: CVA monitoring data were available for all 29 patients with a total monitoring time of 2757 h.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Third-grade students (N = 868, mean age, 8.4 years) attending 13 public elementary schools in Northern California were measured for weight and height, and were asked to complete self-report assessments of depressive symptoms and overweight concerns. RESULTS: A modest association between depressive symptoms and body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) was found for girls (r = 0.14, P<.01), but not for boys (r = 0.01, P<.78). Among girls, depressive symptoms were strongly associated with overweight concerns (r = 0.32, P<.001). After controlling for level of overweight concerns, BMI was no longer significantly associated with depressive symptoms among girls. In contrast, after controlling for BMI, overweight concerns remained significantly associated with depressive symptoms.",

RESULTS: Interventions in the city were associated with a substantially shorter response time in comparison to rural areas. In the city, the distances were generally less than 10\u2009km. In the rural area, however, such short distances accounted for only 7.2% of events, while 33.8% were over 30\u2009km. Medical emergency teams more often acted exclusively on-site or ceased any interventions in rural areas.

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: Activation of the innate immune receptors, Toll-like receptors 2 and 4, are critical for a host inflammatory response to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. These receptors can initiate and modulate the inflammatory response. Differential regulation of Toll-like receptors may be one of the mechanisms by which intrauterine inflammation signals parturition. Likewise, progestational agents may have the ability to modify this effect. These studies were performed to elucidate the effect of intrauterine inflammation and medroxyprogesterone acetate on Toll-like receptor expression in the uterus, cervix, and placenta in a mouse model of intrauterine inflammation. STUDY DESIGN: On day 15 of gestation, CD-1 mice were randomized to pretreatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate or vehicle before intrauterine infusion with lipopolysaccharide or sterile saline solution. Six hours after intrauterine infusion, uterine, cervical, and placental tissues were harvested. RNA and protein were extracted. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed for Toll-like receptor 2 and 4 messenger RNA. Western blot analysis was performed with Toll-like receptor 4-specific antibodies. RESULTS: Intrauterine inflammation up-regulated Toll-like receptor 2 and 4 messenger RNA in uterus, cervix, and placenta. Pretreatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate decreased the lipopolysaccharide-induced up-regulation of Toll-like receptor 2 and 4 messenger RNA in the cervix and placenta. Medroxyprogesterone acetate did not alter the lipopolysaccharide-induced up-regulation of Toll-like receptor 2 and 4 messenger RNA in the uterus.",

FOLFIRINOX (5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and leucovorin) tripled the response rate and significantly increased median survival for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer and shows promise for neoadjuvant use. Toxicity concerns prompted a careful analysis of our initial FOLFIRINOX experience. METHODS: All patients diagnosed with borderline resectable, biopsy-proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX between July 2010 and December 2012 were reviewed. Primary outcome was surgical resectability. Secondary outcomes were treatment-related toxicities and survival. RESULTS: FOLFIRINOX followed by gemcitabine- or capecitabine-based chemoradiation was initiated in 18 patients. The most common grade 3 or 4 toxicities during chemotherapy were gastrointestinal, including nausea/emesis (n = 5), weight loss (n = 3) and diarrhea (n = 2), and hematologic (n = 2; neutropenia); five patients (36%) required a total of six admissions.

While T-plate fixation was the method of choice until the end of the 1980s, minimally invasive techniques have been favoured during the past decade. The indication for primary shoulder prosthesis is controversial. The purpose of this report was to evaluate the scientific evidence of current treatment recommendations. METHODS: Relevant articles were retrieved from \"Medline\" and \"Knowledge-Finder\" using the combined search strategy for the keywords \"proximal humerus\" and \"fracture\". Retrieved articles were evaluated according to the criteria of evidence-based medicine. RESULTS: The analysis retrieved 3 randomized, 4 prospective, and 26 retrospective studies and a number of review articles relevant to the subject. Limitations of most publications were due to small study populations, differences in patient selection and fracture classification as well as measurements of outcome. According to these studies good functional results can be achieved in dislocated two-part fractures treated with minimal osteosynthesis in the elderly and T-plate fixation in younger patients. For three- and four-part fractures minimally invasive techniques seem to be more favourable in the elderly. However, there is some evidence that alternative therapies such as conservative treatment and plating can be successful in defined populations. A general indication for primary implantation of a prosthesis in four-part fractures in the elderly is not supported by the literature.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Smoking by adolescents has been identified as a major public health issue. Raising the legal age of cigarette purchase from 16 to 18 years has attempted to address the issue by restricting adolescents' access. METHODS/ STRATEGY: A prospective study evaluating the impact of non-prosecutory enforcement of public health legislation involving 'beat police' was conducted in the Northern Sydney Health region. Secondary students, aged 12 to 17 years, from both intervention and control regions were surveyed about cigarette smoking habits by means of a self-completed questionnaire administered pre- and post-intervention. RESULTS: 12,502 anonymous questionnaires were completed. At baseline, 19.3% of male students and 21.2% of female students indicated they were current smokers. Age and sex stratified chi-squared analysis revealed significantly lower post-intervention smoking prevalence for year 8 and 10 females and year 7 males among the intervention group. Higher post-intervention smoking prevalences were demonstrated for year 7 and 9 females and year 8 males among the intervention group and in year 10 males and year 11 females among the control group. The analysis of combined baseline and follow-up data from coeducational schools with logistic regression techniques demonstrated that the intervention had a significant effect in reducing smoking prevalence among year 7 students only (OR = 0.54).",

Study enrollment was offered to patients with clinical presentation of biliary colic symptoms, radiological findings suggestive of gallstones, and normal serum biochemistry results. Study participants were randomized to receive either routine LC treatment or LC+IOC treatment. The routine LC procedure was carried out using the standard four-port technique; the LC+IOC procedure was carried out with the addition of meglumine diatrizoate (1:1 dilution with normal saline) injection via a catheter introduced through a small incision in the cystic duct made by laparoscopic scissors. Operative data and postoperative outcomes, including operative time, retained common bile duct (CBD) stones, CBD injury, other complications and length of hospital stay, were recorded for comparative analysis. Inter-group differences were statistically assessed by the \u03c72 test (categorical variables) and Fisher's exact test (binary variables), with the threshold for statistical significance set at P<0.05. RESULTS: A total of 371 patients were enrolled in the trial (late-adolescent to adult, age range: 16-70 years), with 185 assigned to the routine LC group and 186 to the LC+IOC group.

They have been implicated in a range of diseases including cancer, with most information pertaining to their function in tumourigenesis being derived from in vitro studies, or model organisms. Their putative roles as tumour suppressors or tumour promoters remain to be validated in vivo. Little is known about their role in breast tumourigenesis. We sought to evaluate the seven sirtuin family members (SIRT1-7) in a human breast cancer cohort, in relation to clinico-pathological features and outcome of the disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemical analysis of SIRT1-7 protein levels was undertaken in 392 oestrogen receptor (ER+ve) and 153 ER-ve breast tumour samples. SIRT1-7 transcriptional levels were assessed in normal (n=25), non-malignant (n=73) and malignant (n=70) breast tissue using Relative Quantitative Real Time PCR. Statistical analyses determined if SIRT1-7 transcription or protein expression was associated with clinical parameters or outcome. RESULTS: In ER-ve tumours, high protein levels of nuclear SIRT2 were associated with reduced time to recurrence and disease-specific death. This association was only observed in Grade 3 tumours. In the ER+ve cohort, high SIRT2 nuclear levels were associated with shorter disease-free survival and time to recurrence whilst on Tamoxifen, in patients with Grade 3 tumours. Conversely, in Grade 2 tumours, high SIRT2 levels were associated with increased time to recurrence.",

The study assessed ease of use and psychometric properties of this approach, comparing the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) paper form with the electronic (eLCSS-QL). Objectives were to: (1) measure completion times; (2) evaluate acceptability by patients, nurses, and physicians; (3) determine the correlation of the eLCSS-QL with the paper version; and (4) determine the feasibility of using a shorter visual analogue scale (VAS) in the electronic version. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were entered at 12 COMET clinics. All had: (a) stage III or IV non-small cell lung cancer, (b) Karnofsky performance status (KPS)\u2009 \u2265\u2009 60, (c) no prior chemotherapy, and (d) received initial courses of docetaxel + platinum. Of the 148 patients enrolled, characteristics were: men, 57 %; median, KPS 80 %; and median age, 67 years. Of these, 131 patients completed the evaluation form. RESULTS: The eLCSS-QL had excellent acceptance by patients, nurses, and physicians. Patients required 2.2 min (mean) to complete the eLCSS-QL. Reliability coefficients using Cronbach's alpha were high for the paper (0.84) and electronic (0.88) versions. The correlation coefficient between forms was high (0.92).

Burnout is characterized by physical and emotional exhaustion, apathy, cynical attitude, low personal accomplishment and reduced self-control. Several studies on occupational stress have demonstrated that burnout has a strong impact on certain professions and in particular on teachers. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to highlight and compare differences among clinical disorders diagnosed in four different classes of workers in the Public Administration sector, with particular focus on job-related and mental disorders. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on the data collected in 3,447 medical examinations, performed by the Milan Health District from January 1992 to December 2003, in order to assess work fitness, researchers compared four categories of state employees (teachers, clerks, health care professionals and blue collars). RESULTS: The findings revealed that the risk of teachers to develop psychiatric disorders is 2-, 2.5-, and 3-fold higher than that of clerks, health care professionals and blue collars, respectively. Age or sex did not represent a confounding factor for increased rate of psychiatric disorders. Interestingly, teachers also presented an approximately 1.5-2 fold higher risk of developing neoplasms, compared with clerks and blue collars.",

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Injuries from terror and war are not necessarily comparable, especially among civilians and soldiers. For example, civilians have less direct exposure to conflict and are unprepared for injury, whereas soldiers are psychologically and physically prepared for combat on battlefields that are often far from trauma centers. Evidence-based studies distinguishing and characterizing differences in injuries according to conflict type and population group are lacking. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed using hospitalization data from the Israel National Trauma Registry (10/2000-12/2006). RESULTS: Terror and war accounted for trauma hospitalizations among 1784 civilians and 802 soldiers. Most civilians (93%) were injured in terror and transferred to trauma centers by land, whereas soldiers were transferred by land and air. Critical injuries and injuries to multiple body regions were more likely in terror than war. Soldiers tended to present with less severe injuries from war than from terror. Rates of first admission to orthopedic surgery were greater for all casualties with the exception of civilians injured in terror who were equally likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit. In-hospital mortality was higher among terror (7%) than war (2%) casualties, and particularly among civilians.",

NLR has recently been used as a systemic inflammation marker in chronic diseases as well as a predictor of prognosis in cardiovascular diseases and malignancies.AIM: The objective of the present study was to investigate the relationship between NLR and microvascular complications of diabetes mellitus (DM) in elderly population. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and forty-two patients with DM (145 diabetic patients with complications, 97 diabetic patients without complications) and 218 control subjects were enrolled in this study. NLR and microvascular complications because of DM were evaluated and compared with other inflammatory markers. RESULTS: NLR was higher in the diabetic group (2.21\u00b11.14) than in the controls (2.18\u00b10.76). Furthermore, there was a statistically significant difference between NLR levels in diabetic patients with and without complications (2.46\u00b11.26 vs 2.04\u00b10.51, respectively; p<0.001). The results of themultiple logistic regression analysis depicted that NLR is also an independent predictor for microvascular complications (odds ratio 2.217; 95%confidence interval 1.086-4.526, p=0.029).

Based on the premise that country of origin can be regarded as an index for differing immigration trajectories, the current study examines the extent to which arrival characteristics, resettlement contingencies and cultural factors account for country of origin variations in immigrant children's mental health. Arrival characteristics included child's age at arrival, parental education, parental fluency in English or French, and assistance from family at arrival. Resettlement contingencies included parental mental health, intra-familial conflict, settlement stress, separations from parents and child's age when mother started working outside the home. Cultural factors included one-child family composition and parenting styles. METHODS: A national survey of 2,031 families with at least one child between the ages of 4 and 6 or 11 and 13 from HK, the PRC and the Philippines was conducted with the Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) in snowball-generated samples in 6 different cities across Canada. Predictors of the dependent variable, emotional problems (EP), were examined in a hierarchical block regression analysis. EP was regressed on ethnic and country of origin group in model 1; arrival characteristics were added in model 2; resettlement contingencies in model 3 and cultural factors in model 4. RESULTS: The final set of predictor variables accounted for 19.3 % of the variance in EP scores among the younger cohort and 23.2 % in the older. Parental human and social capital variables accounted for only a small amount of the variance in EP scores.",

METHODS: We enrolled 60 consecutive patients admitted to the critical care unit with the diagnosis of first acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction presenting within 24 hours from symptom onset, and eligible for reperfusion therapy. All patients received streptokinase in the usual dose regimen. Patients underwent resting high-quality 12-lead electrocardiogram recordings to calculate the modified QRS score and estimate the sum of ST segment elevation before (STE1) and 90 minutes after (STE2) streptokinase. The difference between STE1 and STE2 was then measured and accepted as the sum of ST segment resolution, expressed as SigmaSTR. Patients were classified into two groups: those with SigmaSTR>or = 50% of STE1 (the resolution group) and those with SigmaSTR<50% (the non-resolution group). RESULTS: The mean QRS score was significantly lower in the resolution group compared to the non-resolution group (2.88 +/- 1.34 vs 5.93 +/- 1.56, respectively, p<0.001). There was a highly significant negative correlation between QRS score and SSTR with a correlation coefficient r = -0.76.

The traditional dogma that bladder lithiasis constitutes an absolute indication for prostatic surgery has recently been questioned. METHODS: A total of 64 patients with bladder calculi were included in the present study. In all patients, stone clearance was achieved transurethrally. The patients in group 1 (n=32) underwent TURP during the same session, and the patients in group 2 (n=32) underwent medical therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia (tamsulosin plus finasteride). RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 28.23\u00b18.84 months. No statistically significant differences were found between the 2 groups regarding the preoperative parameters (age, International Prostate Symptom Score, prostatic volume, peak urinary flow rate, postvoid residual urine volume, prostate-specific antigen level, and bladder stone characteristics). Both groups experienced statistically significant postoperative improvements in the International Prostate Symptom Score, peak urinary flow rate, and postvoid residual urine volume. However, patients in group 1 experienced a more pronounced improvement in the International Prostate Symptom Score (P=.02) and peak urinary flow rate (P=.001). In total, 11 patients in group 2 underwent TURP during follow-up, with medical management considered to have failed.

OBJECTIVES: To develop a diagnostic screening guideline for ROP that would safely reduce the number of ROP screening funduscopies in our department. METHODS: Data of 275 infants admitted between 1996 and 2000 and screened for ROP according to our Dutch National guideline were studied. Significant risk factors for ROP were calculated, using logistic regression analysis and used to develop a guideline. The discriminative power of the guideline was evaluated using the area under the curve for the receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: Significant risk factors for ROP were: gestational age, birth weight and number of erythrocyte transfusions within the first 4 weeks of life. The combination of these 3 factors resulted in the highest area under the curve: 0.793. Using these 3 factors, a diagnostic screening guideline for ROP was developed: if birth weight + 2 x (gestational age - 20) - 6 x erythrocyte transfusion value within the first 4 weeks of life>or=34, no screening for ROP is necessary. Using this guideline, 22.2% of the infants of the study group could have been excluded from screening; 3.8% of the infants with ROP stages 1-2 would have been missed.",

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the completeness of official data sources on traffic related injuries (TRIs) by using the capture-recapture technique and to calculate an ascertainment corrected number of fatal and serious TRIs among Scottish young people aged 15-24 years. The appropriateness of the approach in this context is also assessed. METHOD: A two sample capture-recapture technique was applied to two official sources of TRI data. Data on TRIs were obtained from the Scottish Health Service and the STATS19 dataset at the University of Essex Data Archive for 1995. Four standards (A-D) of matching were applied to fatalities and serious TRIs to allow plausible relaxation of matching standards within the context of the data collection setting. The completeness of each data source was assessed, and an ascertainment corrected number of fatalities and serious TRIs calculated. RESULTS: The ascertainment corrected number of TRI fatalities among 15-24 year olds using standard D was 104. This represents only a small increase in the number of fatalities using capture-recapture than when using each individual dataset. The completeness of the Scottish Health Service database for TRI fatalities was 93%. The STATS19 database was 95% complete. The ascertainment corrected number of TRI hospital admissions was 1969. The STATS19 and the Scottish Health Service databases were approximately two thirds and three quarters complete respectively for non-fatal TRIs requiring hospitalisation.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: The classic anatomic view of the course of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and its segments familiar to neurosurgeons by a 3-dimensional microscopic cranial view may be challenging to understand when seen in the unique 2-dimensional view of transnasal endoscopic surgery. OBJECTIVE: We re-examined our 1996 classification of 7 (C1-C7) segments of the ICA, comparing the arterial course in cadaveric dissections for both a transnasal endoscopic transpenoidal approach and frontotemporal craniotomy. METHODS: Five formalin-fixed cadaveric heads injected with colored silicone underwent thin-cut computed tomographic scanning for bony and vascular analysis. The ICA's intracranial course viewed by transnasal endoscopic dissection was compared with the view of a bilateral frontotemporal crantiotomy, from the petrous (C2) to communicating (C7) segments. RESULTS: Refinement of our 1996 ICA classification provides an anatomical understanding for endoscopic exposures transnasally along an inferior skull base trajectory. The changing course of the ICA, initially termed loop is now termed bend (i.e., implying a change in direction). Four bends are described as the ICA enters into the skull base as C2, C3-C4, C4, and C4-C5. We discuss delineation of certain problematic ICA segments and identify landmarks for endoscopic endonasal approaches.",

        "input": "OBJECTIVES: Concerns have been raised about possible health effects from radiofrequency fields pulsing at around 16 Hz. A radio system used by UK police (TETRA) employs signals which pulse at 17.6 Hz. We tested whether exposure to a continuous wave signal at 385.25 MHz or a TETRA-like signal resulted in symptoms among users reporting sensitivity to TETRA compared to users not reporting sensitivity to TETRA. METHODS: 60 sensitive and 60 non-sensitive users were exposed to three 50 min conditions: a signal with a 16 Hz component, a continuous wave condition and a sham condition. The mean radiated power for the 16 Hz and continuous wave conditions was 250 mW. The order of conditions was randomised and testing was conducted double-blind. Participants reported the severity of eight symptoms during and after each exposure, their mood state at the end of each exposure, and whether they could tell which sessions involved active signals. The study was registered in advance with the ISRCTN register. RESULTS: Exposure to the continuous wave signal increased ratings of headache in all participants, fatigue in non-sensitive participants and difficulty concentrating in sensitive participants. Paradoxically, it reduced sensations of itching in sensitive participants. These effects were not observed in the condition with 16 Hz pulsing, except for those relating to concentration. Adjusting for multiple comparisons removed most significant effects, but not those relating to itch.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: The established initial treatment of patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) consists of the administration of subcutaneous, weight adjusted, low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH). However, the use of the same LMWH dosages for patients with either DVT or PE is not supported by data from comparative studies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 1,000 consecutive patients with acute, proximal DVT were prospectively evaluated. All patients underwent a ventilation-perfusion lung scan on admission, and remained in hospital for at least 7 days. Patients with silent PE received once daily 10,000 to 15,000 IU subcutaneous LMWH dalteparin according to body weight for 7 days, and then vitamin K antagonists. Patients with DVT alone received LMWH in a fixed dose of 10,000 IU once daily for at least 5 days, and then vitamin K antagonists. The rate of both, major bleeding and symptomatic PE episodes during the 7-day study period was evaluated. RESULTS: Thirteen patients (1.3%) developed recurrent PE (1 died) and 16 patients (1.6%) had major bleeding (7 died). Recurrent PE was significantly more common in patients with silent PE (9 of 258 patients, 3.5%) than in those with DVT alone (4 of 742 patients, 0.5%. Odds ratio: 6.5; p<0.001). There were no significant differences in bleeding rate between patients with silent PE and those with DVT alone. However, the use of a fixed 10,000 IU dose in patients with DVT alone led to a significantly higher rate of bleeding (1.3% vs. 0.2%, p<0.001).",

However, the impact on direct and indirect perioperative costs comparing 2 different short-acting local anesthetics has not been performed yet. DESIGN: Observational, prospective, case-control, cost-minimization study. SETTING: Operating room, regional hospital PATIENTS: One hundred adult American Society of Anesthesiologists status I-III patients scheduled for popliteal block after minor ambulatory foot surgery. INTERVENTIONS: Application of 30 mL chloroprocaine 3% or of 30 mL mepivacaine 1.5% for anesthesia. MEASUREMENTS: Cost-minimization evaluation. Direct and indirect perioperative costs were calculated. Block success, onset time and block duration, patient satisfaction, and unplanned outpatient visits or readmissions after discharge were also assessed. MAIN RESULTS: Onset time (sensory: 4.3 \u00b1 2.4 vs 11.5 \u00b1 3.2 minutes; motor: 7.1 \u00b1 3.7 vs 18.4 \u00b1 4.5 minutes) and block duration (sensory: 105 \u00b1 26 vs 317 \u00b1 46 minutes; motor: 91 \u00b1 25 vs 216 \u00b1 31 minutes) were significantly shorter (P<.001) when chloroprocaine 3% was used.

PURPOSE: This paper explored predictors of intent to leave (ITL) a nursing position in all rural and remote practice settings in Canada. Based on the conceptual framework developed for this project, potential predictors of ITL were related to the individual RN worker, the workplace, the community context, and satisfaction related to both the workplace and the community(s) within which the RN lived and worked. METHODS: A national cross-sectional mail survey of RNs in rural and remote Canada provided the data (n = 3,051) for the logistic regression analysis of predictors of ITL. FINDINGS: We found that RNs were more likely to plan to leave their nursing position within the next 12 months if they: were male, reported higher perceived stress, did not have dependent children or relatives, had higher education, were employed by their primary agency for a shorter time, had lower community satisfaction, had greater dissatisfaction with job scheduling, had lower satisfaction with their autonomy in the workplace, were required to be on call, performed advanced decisions or practice, and worked in a remote setting.",

Regardless of the cause, we hypothesized that damaged epithelial cells in the atrophic acini could be a source of the elevation of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The aim of this study was to find any possible association between the extent of prostatic atrophy in needle biopsies and serum PSA level. METHODS: The study was based on 131 needle prostatic biopsies corresponding to 107 patients. The only diagnosis in all biopsies was focal prostatic atrophy without the presence of cancer, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, or areas suspicious for cancer. The extent of atrophy was measured in two ways: the linear extent in millimeters and the percentage of linear extent showing atrophy for each biopsy. Spearman's coefficient of rank correlation was used to evaluate the association of atrophy extent with total and free serum PSA levels. RESULTS: A positive and statistically significant correlation was found between the linear atrophy extent and the total serum PSA level (r = 0.25, P =<0.01) and free PSA level (r = 0.23, P = 0.01). A positive and statistically significant correlation was found between the percentage of the linear extent showing atrophy and the total serum PSA level (r = 0.23, P = 0.01) and free PSA level (r = 0.20, P = 0.02).",

It is believed that these patients are overtreated. The current analyses aim to explore patient-level heterogeneity in survival effects, examine matching of patients to treatments in practice, and identify patient characteristics driving heterogenous effects, in order to present more comprehensive evidence about the concerns of overtreatment. METHODS: Eleven-year all-cause and PCa-specific survival among SEER-Medicare patients diagnosed during 1996-2002 were analyzed using local instrumental variable approaches. RESULTS: A total of 8462 (77%) of 11,036 patients received RP.

We examined the relative effects of patient risk factors for gastrointestinal toxicity, other patient characteristics, and physician prescribing preferences on the decision to prescribe a selective COX-2 inhibitor. METHODS: We retrospectively studied a cohort of 28,190 Medicare beneficiaries who were continuously enrolled in a large, state-run pharmacy benefits program that reimbursed for selective COX-2 inhibitors and nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) without restrictions. Half of the study sample filled a prescription for a selective COX-2 inhibitor and the other half for a nonselective NSAID. Multivariable logistic regression models were developed to predict COX-2 inhibitor use. RESULTS: Seventeen percent of patients using a COX-2 inhibitor had no identifiable risk factor for NSAID-associated gastrointestinal toxicity, compared with 23% of those using a nonselective NSAID. Established risk factors (age>or =75 years, history of gastrointestinal hemorrhage or peptic ulcer disease, or concomitant warfarin or oral glucocorticoid use) were all significant predictors of COX-2 inhibitor use, but a multivariable model including only these risk factors discriminated poorly between the two patient groups (C statistic = 0.55).

Cases were defined as patients hospitalized with a discharge diagnosis of neutropenia. Medical records were sought to validate the diagnoses of neutropenia and to characterize the severity of disease. Four controls were randomly selected for each case, matched for age, sex, state, and year of diagnosis. The frequency of exposures to cimetidine in the 30 days prior to hospital admission in the cases was compared to that in the identical time periods in the controls. RESULTS: When investigators simultaneously controlled for multiple, potentially confounding variables by using conditional logistic regression, the odds ratio associated with the use of cimetidine was 1.2 (P = 0.33), with a one-sided upper 95% confidence limit of 2.6 for all patients over 20 years of age, and 0.6 (P = 0.30) with a one-sided upper 95% confidence limit of 3.1 for validated cases over 12 years of age. Neither a dose-response relationship was evident (P = 0.899 and P = 0.716, respectively, when excluding the nonusers, or P = 0.245 and P = 0.215, respectively, when including the nonusers). From these data, one can exclude the occurrence of hospitalization with neutropenia or agranulocytosis due to cimetidine occurring more often than once in every 116,000 patients and once in every 573,000 patients receiving a 6-week course of the drug, respectively.",

        "input": "PURPOSE: The role of adjuvant chemotherapy in early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) has been controversial. We have previously reported the cases of patients managed with a policy of observation only. We now present the salvage rate for the patients in that study who experienced relapse. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred ninety-four patients with stage I EOC presenting between 1980 and 1994 received no adjuvant chemotherapy, but were treated with platinum-based chemotherapy at relapse. We calculated the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for the whole cohort and the salvage rate for those who experienced relapse. We defined salvage as freedom from relapse for 5 years after platinum treatment. RESULTS: Sixty-one (31%) of 194 patients experienced relapse, and 55 received platinum-based chemotherapy. Twenty-four percent were progression-free at 5 years after this treatment. Clear-cell histology and cyst rupture before the patients' original surgery were independent prognostic factors for PFS after salvage chemotherapy. The OS for all 194 patients is 72% at 10 years (median follow-up, 8.7 years), with an 80% disease-specific survival (DSS).",

The area under the ROC curve, sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios of cutoffs for %BF were calculated. The association between %BF and hypertension was analyzed using Poisson regression, estimating the unadjusted and adjusted prevalence ratios and 95% CI. RESULTS: The %BF equations showed good discriminatory power for hypertension (area under the ROC curve>0.50). Considering the entire sample, the cutoffs for %BF with better properties for screening hypertension were identified in the equation with BMI for men (%BF = 20.4) and with WC for women (%BF = 34.1).

        "input": "PURPOSE: Recent guidelines have recommended the use of a percentage of oxygen uptake reserve (VO2R) for prescribing aerobic exercise intensity for cardiac patients. Moreover, these guidelines suggest that a threshold intensity may exist, below which no improvement in peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) occurs. The purpose, therefore, was to translate the intensity of aerobic exercise in previous training studies using cardiac patients into %VO2R units, and determine whether a threshold intensity exists. METHODS: Twenty-three studies, using 28 groups of aerobically trained cardiac patients, were identified in which VO2peak was measured before and after training by gas exchange. Intensity of exercise was variously described as a percentage of VO2peak, percentage of peak heart rate (HRpeak), percentage of heart rate reserve (HRR), or percentage of peak workload. These intensities were translated into equivalent units of %VO2R. RESULTS: Of the 28 groups of patients, three failed to show significant improvements in VO2peak. These groups exercised at intensities corresponding to 47-55% of VO2R. However, six other groups exercised at comparable intensities (i.e., 42% to 55% of VO2R) and experienced significant increases in VO2peak. Other confounding variables in these studies were similar, including the initial VO2peak of the subjects, suggesting that the failure of three groups to significantly improve aerobic capacity was due to their small sample size.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Since its 1999 emergence in New York City, West Nile virus (WNV) has become the most important and widespread cause of mosquito-transmitted disease in North America. Its sweeping spread from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast was accompanied by widespread mortality among wild birds, especially corvids. Only sporadic avian mortality had previously been associated with this infection in the Old World. Here, we examine the possibility that reservoir host mortality may intensify transmission, both by concentrating vector mosquitoes on remaining hosts and by preventing the accumulation of \"herd immunity\". RESULTS: Inspection of the Ross-Macdonald expression of the basic reproductive number (R0) suggests that this quantity may increase with reservoir host mortality. Computer simulation confirms this finding and indicates that the level of virulence is positively associated with the numbers of infectious mosquitoes by the end of the epizootic. The presence of reservoir incompetent hosts in even moderate numbers largely eliminated the transmission-enhancing effect of host mortality. Local host die-off may prevent mosquitoes to \"waste\" infectious blood meals on immune host and may thus facilitate perpetuation and spread of transmission.",

Despite promising clinical interventions, most socially anxious adolescents remain untreated. To address this clinical neglect, we developed a school-based, 12-week group intervention for youth with SAD, Skills for Academic and Social Success (SASS). When implemented by psychologists, SASS has been found effective. To promote dissemination and optimize treatment access, we tested whether school counselors could be effective treatment providers. METHOD: We randomized 138, ninth through 11th graders with SAD to one of three conditions: (a) SASS delivered by school counselors (C-SASS), (b) SASS delivered by psychologists (P-SASS), or (c) a control condition, Skills for Life (SFL), a nonspecific counseling program. Blind, independent, evaluations were conducted with parents and adolescents at baseline, post-intervention, and 5\u00a0months beyond treatment completion. We hypothesized that C-SASS and P-SASS would be superior to the control, immediately after treatment and at follow-up. No prediction was made about the relative efficacy of C-SASS and P-SASS. RESULTS: Compared to controls, adolescents treated with C-SASS or P-SASS experienced significantly greater improvement and reductions of anxiety at the end of treatment and follow-up.

Patients' illness perceptions have been found to play a role in somatoform disorders. However, it is unclear whether illness perceptions predict higher health costs in these patients. METHOD: A total of 1785 primary care patients presenting a new health complaint completed a questionnaire on their illness perceptions and emotional distress before the consultation. The physicians completed a questionnaire for each patient on diagnostics after the consultation. In a stratified subsample, physician interviewers established diagnoses of DSM-IV somatization and undifferentiated somatoform disorders (n\u00a0=\u00a0144) using the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry. Healthcare expenditure was obtained from Danish health registers for a 2-year follow-up period.

BACKGROUND: Since the high rate of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty limited its long-term success, the implementation of locally delivered antiproliferative/immunosuppressive agents became advantageous. METHODS: Rats underwent balloon denudation of the abdominal aorta and received sirolimus, tacrolimus, or FK778 for 28 days in varying doses. Aortas were harvested for histologic evaluation, profibrotic gene expression, and organ chamber studies. Antifibrotic, antiproliferative and antimigratory effects of the immunosuppressants were further evaluated in vitro. RESULTS: Histology of untreated animals revealed marked intimal hyperplasia with moderate luminal obliteration. Neointima formation was dose-dependently attenuated by all three agents with FK778 and sirolimus being most efficacious. Organ chamber relaxation studies showed a leftward shift of the nitroglycerin and the acetylcholine dose-responses in all treatment groups, indicating diminished endothelial dysfunction. In vivo, only FK778 treatment revealed a significant downregulation of the TGF-beta/vasorin system which could be explained by upregulation of the TGF-beta-inhibitory mediator SMAD7. In vitro, FK778 showed most potent antiproliferative and antimigratory effects on SMC compared with sirolimus and tacrolimus.

RESULTS: Chemotherapy has doubled survival in comparison with best supportive care in gastrointestinal tumors. A subjective response, represented by a decrease in cancer-related symptoms is expected in about half of the symptomatic patients in colorectal and gastric cancer. In pancreatic cancer, the positive results in terms of clinical benefit helped define the role of chemotherapy. Although clinical benefit does not represent a validated tool to measure quality of life, it can be a first step in the definition of new, simpler tools to assess this end point. The frequent presence of a serious concomitant disease, liver cirrhosis, in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) usually prevents the use of chemotherapy in these tumors, which are often treated with locoregional treatments.

However, in the interaction models the relative risk (RR) of death for high-level non-manual employees was decreasing with increasing income inequality (RR = 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63-0.93), whereas the corresponding risk for unskilled manual workers increased with increasing income inequality (RR = 1.24; 95% CI, 1.06-1.46). The RRs for skilled manual, low- and medium- level non-manual employees were not significant. Controlling for income at the individual level did not substantially alter these findings, neither did potential confounders at the municipality level.",

The velocity of a 500 microm TiO2-microsphere as inert marker, which is placed on the mucosa region of interest, is measured by a vector-analytic calculation in mm/min. RESULTS: : We validated this technique in 20 subjects with measurements on the floor of the nose. The inter-individual variance and variable transport speed at different locations as known from the literature could be confirmed.",

However, it is unknown whether changes in Framingham risk score variables over time explain the association between SES and coronary heart disease. We examined this question given its relevance to risk assessment in clinical decision making. METHODS: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study data (initiated in 1987 with 10-years follow-up of 15,495 adults aged 45-64 years in four Southern and Mid-Western communities) were used. SES was assessed at baseline, dichotomized as low SES (defined as low education and/or low income) or not. The time dependent variables - smoking, total and high density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and use of blood pressure lowering medication - were assessed every three years. Ten-year incidence of coronary heart disease was based on EKG and cardiac enzyme criteria, or adjudicated death certificate data. Cox survival analyses examined the contribution of SES to heart disease risk independent of baseline Framingham risk score, without and with further adjustment for the time dependent variables. RESULTS: Adjusting for baseline Framingham risk score, low SES was associated with an increased coronary heart disease risk (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.53; 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 1.27 to 1.85). After further adjustment for the time dependent variables, the SES effect remained significant (HR = 1.44; 95% CI, 1.19 to 1.74).",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: The use of dispersants can be an effective way to deal with acute oil spills to limit environmental damage, however very little is known about whether chemically dispersed oil have the same toxic effect on marine organisms as mechanically dispersed oil. We exposed Atlantic cod larvae to chemically and mechanically dispersed oil for four days during the first-feeding stage of development, and collected larvae at 14 days post hatch for transcriptional analysis. A genome-wide microarray was used to screen for effects and to assess whether molecular responses to chemically and mechanically dispersed oil were similar, given the same exposure to oil (droplet distribution and concentration) with and without the addition of a chemical dispersant (Dasic NS). RESULTS: Mechanically dispersed oil induced expression changes in almost three times as many transcripts compared to chemically dispersed oil (fold change>+/-1.5). Functional analyses suggest that chemically dispersed oil affects partly different pathways than mechanically dispersed oil. By comparing the alteration in gene transcription in cod larvae exposed to the highest concentrations of either chemically or mechanically dispersed oil directly, the chemically dispersed oil affected transcription of genes involved nucleosome regulation, i.e. genes encoding proteins participating in DNA replication and chromatin formation and regulation of cell proliferation, whereas the mechanically dispersed oil most strongly affected genes encoding proteins involved in proteasome-mediated protein degradation. Cyp1a was the transcript that was most strongly affected in both exposure groups, with a 60-fold induction in the two high-exposure groups according to the RT-qPCR data, but no significant difference in transcriptional levels was observed between the two treatments.",

DESIGN: 660 patients with idiopathic or hereditary CP and up to 1758 controls were enrolled. PRSS1, SPINK1 and CTRC were analysed by DNA sequencing, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) by melting curve analysis. RESULTS: Frequencies of CFTR variants p.R75Q, p.I148T, 5T-allele and p.E528E were comparable in patients and controls. We identified 103 CFTR variants, which represents a 2.7-fold risk increase (p<0.0001). Severe cystic fibrosis (CF)-causing variants increased the risk of developing CP 2.9-fold, and mild CF-causing variants 4.5-fold (p<0.0001 for both). Combined CF-causing variants increased CP risk 3.4-fold (p<0.0001), while non-CF-causing variants displayed a 1.5-fold over-representation in patients (p=0.14). CFTR compound heterozygous status with variant classes CF-causing severe and mild represented an OR of 16.1 (p<0.0001). Notably, only 9/660 (1.4%) patients were compound heterozygotes in this category.

METHOD: The study included 666 Jefferson Medical College students who graduated in 2011-2013. Students used a peer nomination instrument to identify classmates who had a positive influence on their professional and personal development. At matriculation, these students had completed a survey that included the Jefferson Scale of Empathy and Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire short form and abridged versions of the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and UCLA Loneliness Scale. In multivariate analyses of variance, the method of contrasted groups was used to compare the personality attributes of students nominated most frequently by their peers as positive influencers (top influencers [top 25% in their class distribution], n = 176) with those of students nominated least frequently (bottom influencers [bottom 25%], n = 171).

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Insertions and deletions (indels) account for more nucleotide differences between two related DNA sequences than substitutions do, and thus it is imperative to develop a stochastic evolutionary model that enables us to reliably calculate the probability of the sequence evolution through indel processes. Recently, indel probabilistic models are mostly based on either hidden Markov models (HMMs) or transducer theories, both of which give the indel component of the probability of a given sequence alignment as a product of either probabilities of column-to-column transitions or block-wise contributions along the alignment. However, it is not a priori clear how these models are related with any genuine stochastic evolutionary model, which describes the stochastic evolution of an entire sequence along the time-axis. Moreover, currently none of these models can fully accommodate biologically realistic features, such as overlapping indels, power-law indel-length distributions, and indel rate variation across regions. RESULTS: Here, we theoretically dissect the ab initio calculation of the probability of a given sequence alignment under a genuine stochastic evolutionary model, more specifically, a general continuous-time Markov model of the evolution of an entire sequence via insertions and deletions. Our model is a simple extension of the general \"substitution/insertion/deletion (SID) model\". Using the operator representation of indels and the technique of time-dependent perturbation theory, we express the ab initio probability as a summation over all alignment-consistent indel histories. Exploiting the equivalence relations between different indel histories, we find a \"sufficient and nearly necessary\" set of conditions under which the probability can be factorized into the product of an overall factor and the contributions from regions separated by gapless columns of the alignment, thus providing a sort of generalized HMM. The conditions distinguish evolutionary models with factorable alignment probabilities from those without ones. The former category includes the \"long indel\" model (a space-homogeneous SID model) and the \"short indel\" model (a space-inhomogeneous SID model). We also discuss the implications of our results on the design of indel models and the estimation of evolutionary parameters.",

OBJECTIVE: To compare the relative strengths of association of maternal and paternal BMI with offspring BMI at age 7.5, taking into account the possible effect of non-paternity. METHODS: We compared strength of association for maternal-offspring and paternal-offspring BMI for 4654 complete parent-offspring trios in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), using unstandardised and standardised regression analysis. We carried out a sensitivity analysis to investigate the influence of non-paternity on these associations. RESULTS: The strength of association between parental BMI and offspring BMI at age 7.5 was similar for both parents. Taking into account correlations between maternal and paternal BMI, performing standardised rather than unstandardised regression and carrying out a sensitivity analysis for non-paternity emphasised the robustness of the general similarity of the associations.

METHODS: All patients who underwent LNF by a single surgeon between March 2005 and March 2007 were reviewed. Oesophageal intubation during surgery was routinely performed in all patients who underwent LNF during the first 11 months of the study period, whilst during the second phase, routine oesophageal intubation was not performed. The main outcome measures were the prevalence of post-operative dysphagia and complication rates. Dysphagia severity was assessed clinically by a scoring system at discharge, and again at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year. RESULTS: Forty patients had a bougie inserted (group 1) and 42 had no bougie (group 2).

OBJECTIVES: To describe the patterns (for example, number of visits by year post-injury) and characteristics of the emergency department (ED) visits (for example, acuity level, timing of visits, reasons for visits) made by persons with traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) over a 6-year period following injury. SETTINGS: Ontario, Canada. METHODS: Rates of ED utilization and reasons for ED visits were calculated between the fiscal years 2003-2009. Reasons for visits were categorized by acuity level: potentially preventable visits were defined as visits related to ambulatory sensitive conditions; low acuity and high acuity visits were defined by the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale. RESULTS: The total number of ED visits for the 6-year period is 4403 (n=1217). Of these visits, 752 (17%) were classified as potentially preventable, 1443 (33%) as low acuity and 2208 (50%) as high acuity. The majority of patients, regardless of acuity level, did not see a primary care practitioner on the day of the ED visit and most visits occurred during the weekday (Mon-Fri 0700-1659 hours). ED use was highest in the first year but remained high over the subsequent years. For potentially preventable visits, the majority of visits were related to urinary tract infections (n=385 visits, 51.2%), followed by pneumonia (n=91, 12.1%).",

Early posterior thoracic spinal fusion surgery may additionally impact pulmonary function beyond the natural history of the disease by further inhibiting thoracic growth. The primary study aim is to determine if early thoracic spine fusion patients have diminished pulmonary function versus untreated patients at a similar age. The secondary study aim is to determine how plain radiographic measurements of thoracic deformity change over time and correlate to pulmonary function in these patients. METHODS: Sequential spinal radiographs and one-time pulmonary function tests were performed in 43 consecutive congenital thoracic scoliosis patients with either a history of early posterior thoracic fusion or no surgery. Multiple stepwise t testing compared the patient-related and radiographic variables in the early surgery and no surgery groups. Multiple stepwise linear regression analysis examined the effect of the variables at final follow-up on forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume. RESULTS: All patients exhibited decreased forced vital capacity, but there was no difference between early surgery and no surgery groups at an average follow-up age of 10.5 years. A mid- (versus low) thoracic apex, decreased space available for the lung, and decreased age-corrected thoracic width correlated with decreased forced vital capacity. Between initial and final radiographic follow-up, the rate of change in thoracic height and width was decreased in the early surgery versus no surgery group.",

The main outcome measures were the proportion of positive tests in both groups and the correlation between cervical and vaginal values through the Pearson correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Both groups were similar in terms of general characteristics and pregnancy outcomes. The proportions of positive results in the vaginal secretions were 7.5% and 25.0% (P=0.007) in the control and coitus group, respectively. In the cervical secretions, the proportions of positive tests were greater, but not statistically different (39.7% and 40.0%, respectively).

The question arises as to who might be better equipped currently to provide services to multilingual populations: SLTs with more clinical experience in such contexts, or recently trained SLTs who are themselves linguistically and culturally diverse and whose training programmes deliberately focused on multilingualism and multiculturalism? AIMS: To investigate whether length of clinical experience influenced: number of bilingual children treated, languages spoken by these children, languages in which assessment and remediation can be offered, assessment instrument(s) favoured, and languages in which therapy material is required. METHOD: From questionnaires completed by 243 Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA)-registered SLTs who treat children with language problems, two groups were drawn:71 more experienced (ME) respondents (20+ years of experience) and 79 less experienced (LE) respondents (maximum 5 years of experience). RESULTS: The groups did not differ significantly with regard to (1) number of children(monolingual or bilingual) with language difficulties seen, (2) number of respondents seeing child clients who have Afrikaans or an African language as home language, (3) number of respondents who can offer intervention in Afrikaans or English and (4) number of respondents who reported needing therapy material in Afrikaans or English.

This study primarily compares contraceptive use among women whose abortion outcome was assessed in-clinic with women who assessed their abortion outcome at home, in a low-resource, primary health care setting. Moreover, it investigates how background characteristics and abortion service provision influences contraceptive use post-abortion. METHODS: A randomized controlled, non-inferiority, trial (RCT) compared clinic follow-up with home-assessment of abortion outcome at 2\u00a0weeks post-abortion. Additionally, contraceptive-use at 3\u00a0months post-abortion was investigated through a cross-sectional follow-up interview with a largely urban sub-sample of women from the RCT.

OBJECTIVES: To gauge whether musculoskeletal physiotherapist working in the UK are compliant with the NICE guidelines for back pain, and if they believe them to be practical and relevant to their current practice. DESIGN: Descriptive cross-sectional voluntary electronic survey. METHODS: A survey of musculoskeletal physiotherapists currently working in the UK was conducted through an anonymous online data collection website over a two month data collection period. Data was collected about demographic details of participants, and their views about the NICE guidelines through a specially designed questionnaire, and are presented descriptively. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty-three therapists participated. Following a thematic content analysis seven key themes were identified about the guidelines: they facilitated evidence-based practice; they were unrealistic and idealistic; they did not facilitate a multimodal approach; they promoted largely a passive approach; they challenged therapist autonomy; they were outdated; they lacked relevance and specificity.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis is still regarded as a contraindication for kidney transplantation alone by most centers. The value of aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) and other non-invasive markers has been less studied in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive patients with concurrent end-stage renal disease to predict hepatic fibrosis. Can these be used to effectively decrease the number of biopsies done in these patients being evaluated for transplantation? METHODS: Our study population included 255 patients with liver biopsy data. All patient information was collected and reviewed from medical records. The diagnostic accuracy of the predictive models was analyzed by calculating sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value. RESULTS: The variables associated with F3-F4 were aspartate aminotransferase (P = 0.007), bilirubin (P \u2264 0.001), platelet count (P = 0.01) and APRI (P \u2264 0.001). The use of any one laboratory abnormality to predict liver biopsy scores did not show high positive predictive values (22.6-72.7%). Having abnormal liver findings or cirrhosis on imaging was associated with high specificities (92.0-97.8%) but low sensitivities (31.4-42.9%). Using APRI levels of \u22650.40 and \u22640.95 as an indication for liver biopsy, 50% of patients with F3-F4 would have correctly avoided having a biopsy. However, 33% of patients with F3-F4 would have been mislabeled and not be indicated for a biopsy.",

We tested whether young adults with very high CRP scored high on indicators of chronic disease risk. We also tested intergenerational pathways to and sex-differentiated correlates of very high CRP. METHODS: Data came from Waves I (ages 11-19) and IV (ages 24-34) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N=13,257). At Wave I, participants' parents reported their own education and health behaviors/health. At Wave IV, young adults reported their socioeconomic status, psychological characteristics, reproductive/health behaviors and health; trained fieldworkers assessed BMI, waist circumference, blood-pressure, and medication use, and collected bloodspots from which high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) was assayed. RESULTS: Logistic regression analyses revealed that many common indicators of chronic disease risk - including parental health/health behaviors reported 14 years earlier - were associated with very high CRP in young adults. Several of these associations attenuated with the inclusion of BMI. More than 75% of young adults with very high CRP were female. Sex differences in associations of some covariates and very high CRP were observed.",

They provide enzymes and drugs and serve as experimental organisms. In 1991, a landmark paper estimated that there are 1.5 million fungi on the Earth. Because only 70000 fungi had been described at that time, the estimate has been the impetus to search for previously unknown fungi. Fungal habitats include soil, water, and organisms that may harbor large numbers of understudied fungi, estimated to outnumber plants by at least 6 to 1. More recent estimates based on high-throughput sequencing methods suggest that as many as 5.1 million fungal species exist. METHODS: Technological advances make it possible to apply molecular methods to develop a stable classification and to discover and identify fungal taxa. KEY RESULTS: Molecular methods have dramatically increased our knowledge of Fungi in less than 20 years, revealing a monophyletic kingdom and increased diversity among early-diverging lineages. Mycologists are making significant advances in species discovery, but many fungi remain to be discovered.",

METHODS: A comparative cohort of patients with large or massive rotator cuff tears undergoing arthroscopic repair was studied. Two consecutive groups of patients were included: rotator cuff repairs with L-PRP injection (group 1, n\u00a0= 35) and rotator cuff repairs without L-PRP injection (group 2, n\u00a0= 35). A double-row cross-suture cuff repair was performed by a single surgeon with the same rehabilitation protocol. Patients were clinically evaluated with the Constant score; Simple Shoulder Test score; University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) score; and strength measurements by use of a handheld dynamometer. Rotator cuff healing was evaluated by postoperative MRI using the Sugaya classification (type 1 to type 5). RESULTS: We prospectively evaluated the 2 groups at a minimum 2-year follow-up.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to apply the existing clinical prediction rules used to identify children with fractures after twisting injuries of the ankle to a population that includes adults. METHODS: This was a prospective observational study using convenience sampling. Patients older than 2 years presenting to the ED or associated urgent care center with the chief complaint of an ankle or foot injury were considered eligible for enrollment into the study. After informed consent was obtained, 11 physical examination variables were assessed. Radiographs were obtained and reported, and the radiograph results were noted on the patient's data sheet.

Such distinctions call for clarification of whether psychological well-being and ill-being comprise opposite ends of a bipolar continuum, or are best construed as separate, independent dimensions of mental health. Biology can help resolve this query--bipolarity predicts 'mirrored' biological correlates (i.e. well-being and ill-being correlate similarly with biomarkers, but show opposite directional signs), whereas independence predicts 'distinct' biological correlates (i.e. well-being and ill-being have different biological signatures). METHODS: Multiple aspects of psychological well-being (eudaimonic, hedonic) and ill-being (depression, anxiety, anger) were assessed in a sample of aging women (n = 135, mean age = 74) on whom diverse neuroendocrine (salivary cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, DHEA-S) and cardiovascular factors (weight, waist-hip ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, HDL cholesterol, total/HDL cholesterol, glycosylated hemoglobin) were also measured. RESULTS: Measures of psychological well-being and ill-being were significantly linked with numerous biomarkers, with some associations being more strongly evident for respondents aged 75+. Outcomes for seven biomarkers supported the distinct hypothesis, while findings for only two biomarkers supported the mirrored hypothesis.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Levels of the pro-tumorigenic prostaglandin PGE(2) are increased in colorectal cancer, previously attributed to increased synthesis through COX-2 upregulation and, more recently, to decreased catabolism. The functionally linked genes 15-prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) and the prostaglandin transporter PGT co-operate in prostaglandin degradation and are downregulated in colorectal cancer. We previously reported repression of 15-PGDH expression by the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, commonly deregulated during early colorectal neoplasia. Here we asked whether \u03b2-catenin also regulates PGT expression. METHODS: The effect of \u03b2-catenin deletion in vivo was addressed by PGT immunostaining of \u03b2-catenin(-/lox)-villin-cre-ERT2 mouse tissue. The effect of siRNA-mediated \u03b2-catenin knockdown and dnTCF4 induction in vitro was addressed by semi-quantitative and quantitative real-time RT-PCR and immunoblotting. RESULTS: This study shows for the first time that deletion of \u03b2-catenin in murine intestinal epithelium in vivo upregulates PGT protein, especially in the crypt epithelium. Furthermore, \u03b2-catenin knockdown in vitro increases PGT expression in both colorectal adenoma- and carcinoma-derived cell lines, as does dnTCF4 induction in LS174T cells.",

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a nonconcurrent cohort study of gestational diabetics identified by universal screening and delivered from Jan. 1, 1990, to Dec. 31, 1992. Multiple gestations and patients with chronic medical conditions were excluded. The following risk factors for gestational diabetes mellitus were abstracted: obesity (>80 kg), family history of diabetes, previous gestational diabetes mellitus, and previous macrosomic, stillborn, or anomalous fetus. Patients with one or more risk factors were compared with those without risk factors. A group of low-risk nondiabetic patients served as controls. The incidences of A2 diabetes mellitus, cesarean section, neonatal macrosomia, and shoulder dystocia were the outcome variables of interest. RESULTS: Selective screening would have failed to detect 43% of gestational diabetics. Twenty-eight percent of the missed gestational diabetics would have required insulin (class A2). When compared with controls, patients with gestational diabetes mellitus were at increased risk for macrosomia (26% vs 11%, p<0.01), cesarean section (37% vs 15%, p<0.01), and shoulder dystocia (9% vs 2%, p<0.05).

The objective of this study was to identify asthma policies and practices in rural and urban school settings and to compare them with current National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute recommendations. METHODS: A stratified random sample of school nurses who represented each of the 500 active Pennsylvania school districts were surveyed in 2004 concerning nurse staffing patterns, availability of asthma monitoring and treatment-related equipment, emergency preparedness, availability of asthma-related support and case management services, school-specific procedures including identification of children with asthma and accessibility of inhaler medication during school hours, presence and content of written asthma management plans, and perceived obstacles to asthma management in the school setting. Sampling weights were incorporated into the analyses to take the survey design into account. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 76%, with a total of 757 surveys analyzed. In more than half of secondary schools and three quarters of elementary schools, nurses were present<40 hours per week.

METHODS: In this retrospective cohort analysis, data were obtained from the electronic database of a cardiology clinic. The Joint British Society 2 criteria were used defining low HDL-C as less than 1 mmol/l in males and less than 1.2 mmol/l in females. We compared the prevalence of low HDL-C across the following categories of LDL-C: less than 2, 2-2.5, and greater than 2.5 mmol/l. RESULTS: Two thousand and eighty-seven patients with a mean age of 64.34\u00b111.94 years constituted the study sample. About 36.6% of patients in this study were found to have low HDL-C.

This retrospective study was undertaken to determine if SLNB is justified in patients undergoing CPM. METHODS: Between 1999 and 2004, 155 patients underwent contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) at the Magee-Womens Hospital of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Eighty patients (51.6%) had SLNB performed at the time of CPM. The therapeutic mastectomy and the CPM specimens were evaluated for histopathology. Goldflam's classification was used to determine the risk of malignancy in the CPM specimens. RESULTS: Pathology in the therapeutic mastectomy specimens included 105 (68%) invasive carcinomas and 50 (32%) in-situ carcinomas. Multicentricity and/or multifocality were reported in 49.7%, and 70% were estrogen receptor positive. Two invasive breast cancers and three cases of DCIS were diagnosed in 155 CPM specimens (n = 5, 3.2%). The median number of SLN identified was 2 (range 1-6) from the CPM axilla. Two patients had positive SLNB for metastatic carcinoma (n = 2/80, 2.5%) with no primary tumor identified in the prophylactic mastectomy specimen. In both patients the therapeutic mastectomy was for recurrent invasive carcinoma in patients with a prior history of axillary node dissection. Occult carcinoma was found in five prophylactic mastectomy specimens (n = 5/80, 6.25%).",

METHODS: Two hundred eighty-six case files of consecutive radical prostatectomies were reviewed. The records of patients with pathologic BN involvement (pT4a) or SVI (pT3c) were thoroughly analyzed and compared. The mean and median follow-up periods were 30.8 and 35.5 months (range 9 to 40), respectively, for the patients with Stage pT4a and 40.8 and 44.1 months (range 8 to 86), respectively, for the patients with Stage pT3c. Particular attention was paid to the preoperative clinical and pathologic evaluation, the pathologic analysis of the prostatectomy specimen, and the postoperative follow-up data. Progression was defined as a prostate-specific antigen level of 0.2 ng/mL and rising. Adjuvant therapy was not initiated unless prostate-specific antigen failure had occurred. RESULTS: BN involvement was identified in 25 patients (8.7%) and SVI was found in 26 patients (9.1%). In 7 patients (2.4%), the BN was the only site of positive margins. Thirty-six percent of patients with BN involvement and 62% of patients with SVI demonstrated biochemical progression. Disease-free survival and metastasis-free survival rates were significantly better for the patients with Stage pT4a than for the patients with Stage pT3c at 24 and 36 months after surgery. Univariate analysis identified the prostate-specific antigen nadir to be the most significant predictor of disease-free survival.",

The relationship between urinary melamine levels and several clinical biomarkers of early renal injury such as microalbumin and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) in urine was also examined. METHODS: School children, aged 6-10 y, and their parents who were healthy and lived closely to Kaohsiung Medical University-affiliated hospitals were recruited. All study children had the first 1-spot overnight urine sample collected on the Sunday morning (the first day) immediately when they woke up, and then all the subsequent urine samples continued to be collected until the first 1-spot overnight urine sample on the morning of the next day (Monday, the second day). Two first 1-spot overnight urine samples from their parents on the same Sunday and Monday mornings were also collected. This protocol was completed in the July and August of 2011. All urine samples were measured for melamine, biomarkers of early renal injury, and creatinine. RESULTS: There were 7 girls and 16 boys in this study. Except for one missing urine sample from 1-spot overnight urine sample on the morning of the second day, melamine levels in the rest of urine samples among the study children were all detectable. The median melamine levels of 1-spot overnight urine samples on the first and second day mornings were 0.93 and 1.73 \u03bcg/mmol of creatinine respectively. We found that melamine concentrations of 1-spot overnight urine samples on the second day morning were significantly higher than those on the first day morning (p < 0.001).

We reviewed our early experience and outcomes of LPD. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients undergoing LPD was compared to a matched cohort of open pancreaticoduodenectomy (OPD) patients. The endpoints are as follows: age, gender, ASA score, BMI, operative time, estimated blood loss, perioperative transfusion requirement, intensive care unit stay, margin status, lymph node count, 90\u00a0day morbidity and mortality, length of stay, and adjuvant therapy treatment. RESULTS: Fourteen patients underwent an attempted LPD. The median operative time was 456\u00a0min (interquartile range (IQR), 109.5), median estimated blood loss was 300\u00a0ml (IQR, 225), and 29% of the patients required a perioperative blood transfusion.

The same investigations were carried out in 20 males with NIDDM and in 20 normal non-diabetic males. RESULTS: Women with diabetes had significantly (p<0.01) higher BMD levels than women with normal glucose tolerance. Diabetic females were also significantly overweight (p<0.001) and had a longer duration after menopause (p<0.02). Bone resorption markers and bone formation markers were significantly (p<0.001) higher in the control group compared with the diabetic group.

There are patients who present with systemic associated diseases [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity, severe cardiopathies, immunodeficiencies, etc.]that favour or increase the risk of appearance of an incisional hernia. The aim of the present study was to assess whether the prophylactic placement of a polypropylene mesh in patients at risk can reduce or avoid the appearance of an incisional hernia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-two selected patients with clear risk factors and colon pathology underwent surgical intervention through median infraumbilical laparotomy. During laparotomy the preperitoneal space was dissected at a point where a low-molecular weight polypropylene mesh was to be placed when closing the peritoneum. Meshes were about 7-8 cm wide and had a variable length that depended on the length of the surgical incision. Of the 72 patients, 41 were obese (BMI>30 kg/m(2)), 45 presented with COPD, and 42 with colorectal neoplasia; 29 patients had two risk factors, and 15 had three risk factors. The mesh was held in place with polypropylene stitches in 28% of cases, and with fibrin glue in 72% of cases. RESULTS: All patients were assessed by a protocol that included interview, examination of the surgical wound, and abdominal CT scan. Follow-up was between 3 and 5 years. There were no noteworthy complications or operative mortality. No mesh had to be removed in any patient. Two patients developed liver metastases, and one patient developed a hernia at the mesh site.",

We compared the results of fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) during (47 Gy) and 4 months after RT. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 40 patients with HNC, PET was performed before (PET1), at the end of Week 4 (47 Gy) (PET2), and 4 months after RT (PET3). Visual analysis classified patients as having a complete response (CR) or a non-CR (NCR). The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value for PET2 and PET3 were determined. The 2-year overall survival (OS) rate for a CR and NCR was calculated for both response evaluation points. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 26 months, 10 patients had died, 6 had residual disease, and 24 remained disease free. The overall sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value, and accuracy of PET2 vs. PET3 for the detection of a CR was 28.6%, 81.8%, 31.0%, 80.0%, and 42.5% vs. 78.6%, 75.0%, 60.0%, 88.0%, and 77.5%, respectively.

Because structural abnormalities and remodeling of atria have been observed in AF, we hypothesized that the prothrombotic state in AF may be related to abnormal indexes of matrix degradation. METHODS: We studied 48 consecutive patients (30 men; age, 70.5+/-9.0 years) with chronic nonrheumatic AF who were not on anticoagulation. Plasma levels of MMP-1, TIMP-1, and prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2, an index of thrombogenesis) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. M-mode, 2-dimensional, and Doppler echocardiographic studies were performed in all patients.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Clinical trials concerning acute myocardial infarction often evaluate short-term death. Several baseline characteristics are predictors of death, most notably age. Adjustment for one or more predictors in a multivariable analysis may be considered to correct the estimate of the treatment effect for any imbalance that by chance may have occurred between the randomized groups. Moreover, adjustment results in a stratified estimate of the effect of treatment. METHODS AND RESULTS: The effects of adjustment (correction for imbalance and stratification) were studied with logistic regression analysis in the Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO)-I trial. The primary end point was 30-day death, which occurred in 6.3% of 10,348 patients randomly assigned to tissue plasminogen activator and 7.3% of 20,162 patients randomly assigned to streptokinase thrombolytic therapy. This is equivalent to an unadjusted odds ratio of 0.853. No significant imbalance had occurred for any of 17 baseline characteristics considered, including well-known demographic, presenting, and history characteristics. Adjusted for age, the odds ratio was 0.829, which is an 18% increase in estimated effect on the logistic scale. When adjusted for 17 characteristics, the odds ratio was 0.820, an increase of 25%. The increase in effect estimate was largely explained by the stratification effect and only partly by imbalance of predictors.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 88 patients (7 women, 81 men) suffering from symptomatic scaphoid nonunion, preoperative MRI was performed (coronal PD-w FSE fs, sagittal-oblique T1-w SE nonenhanced and T1-w SE fs contrast-enhanced, sagittal T2*-w GRE). MRI interpretation was based on the intensity of contrast enhancement: 0 = none, 1 = focal, 2 = diffuse. Intraoperatively, the osseous viability was scored by means of bleeding points on the osteotomy site of the proximal scaphoid fragment: 0=absent, 1 = moderate, 2 = good. RESULTS: Intraoperatively, 17 necrotic, 29 compromised, and 42 normal proximal fragments were found. In nonenhanced MRI, bone viability was judged necrotic in 1 patient, compromised in 20 patients, and unaffected in 67 patients. Contrast-enhanced MRI revealed 14 necrotic, 21 compromised, and 53 normal proximal fragments. Judging surgical findings as the standard of reference, statistical analysis for nonenhanced MRI was: sensitivity 6.3%, specificity 100%, positive PV 100%, negative PV 82.6%, and accuracy 82.9%; statistics for contrast-enhanced MRI was: sensitivity 76.5%, specificity 98.1%, positive PV 98.1%, negative PV 82.6%, and accuracy 92.3%.",

The Fistula Risk Score (FRS) predicts the risk and impact of a clinically relevant (CR)-POPF and can be useful in assessing the impact of octreotide in scenarios of risk. METHODS: From 2001-2013, 1018 PDs were performed at four institutions, with octreotide administered at the surgeon's discretion. The FRS was used to analyse the occurrence and burden of POPF across various risk scenarios. RESULTS: Overall, 391 patients (38.4%) received octreotide. A CR-POPF occurred more often when octreotide was used (21.0% versus 7.0%; P<0.001), especially when there was advanced FRS risk. Octreotide administration also correlated with an increased hospital stay (mean: 13 versus 11\u2009days; P\u2009<\u20090.001). Regression analysis, controlling for FRS risk, demonstrated that octreotide increases the risk for CR-POPF development.",

METHODS: Fifty patients with angiographically proven CAD underwent simultaneous 24-h continuous ECG and esophageal pH monitoring. We assessed the number of ST-segment depression episodes (ST dep.) and total duration of ischemic episodes, expressed as total ischemic burden (TIB). In pH-metry, we assessed: time percentage of pH lower than 4, total time of pH lower than 4 and the number of pathological refluxes (PR). Patients fulfilling the GERD criteria received a 7-day therapy with omeprazole 20 mg bid. On the 7th day of therapy, simultaneous Holter and esophageal pH monitoring was repeated.

DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis based on a Phase II randomized controlled trial (RCT) and a cost-utility analysis using a life-time Markov model. SETTING: The RCT was undertaken in Glasgow, Scotland. The economic analysis was undertaken from the UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 612 pregnant women randomized to receive usual cessation support plus or minus financial incentives of up to \u00a3400 vouchers (US $609), contingent upon smoking cessation. MEASUREMENTS: Comparison of usual support and incentive interventions in terms of cotinine-validated quitters, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and direct costs to the NHS. FINDINGS: The incremental cost per quitter at 34-38 weeks pregnant was \u00a31127 ($1716).This is similar to the standard look-up value derived from Stapleton&West's published ICER tables, \u00a31390 per quitter, by looking up the Cessation in Pregnancy Incentives Trial (CIPT) incremental cost (\u00a3157) and incremental 6-month quit outcome (0.14).

We hypothesized that large DTR might be a source of additional environmental stress and, therefore, a risk factor for HF exacerbation. We aimed to test the association between DTR and HF hospitalization and to examine the effect modifiers, such as age, sex, and season. METHODS AND RESULTS: We collected daily meteorologic data and emergency HF hospital admissions from 2000 to 2007 in Hong Kong. We used Poisson regression models to fit the relationship between daily DTR and emergency HF hospitalizations, after adjusting for the time trend, seasonality, mean temperature, humidity, and levels of outdoor air pollution. We confirmed the seasonal variation of HF with peak hospital admissions in winter in Hong Kong. The adverse effects of DTR on emergency HF admissions were observed on the current day and lasted for the following several days. Every 1\u00b0C increase of DTR at lag0 corresponded to 0.86% (95% confidence interval, 0.31%-1.43%) increment of emergency hospital admissions for HF. DTR exhibited significantly greater effect in the cool season, and on female and elderly patients.",

The objective was to evaluate the complication rate of EDPS in elderly adults. METHODS: This was a prospective, observational study of EDPS patients at least 65 years old, as compared with patients aged 18 to 49 and 50 to 64 years. Physicians were blind to the objectives of this research. The study protocol required an ED nurse trained in data collection to be present to record vital signs and assess for any prospectively defined complications. We used American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification for systemic disease to evaluate and account for the comorbidities of patients. We used the Fisher exact test for the difference in proportions across age groups and analysis of variance for the differences in dosing across age and ASA categories. RESULTS: During the 4-year study, we enrolled 50 patients at least 65 years old, 149 patients aged 50 to 64 years, and 665 patients aged 18 to 49 years.

The intention of this study was to investigate whether clinical or laboratory variables, taken after the admission of patients to the intensive care unit (ICU), are able to predict the transfusion requirement of the following 72 h. DESIGN: The values of initially measured systolic blood pressure, hematocrit level, and the values of 2 scores of severity of disease (Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE-II], Mortality Prediction Model [MPM]) were calculated after the admission of patients to the ICU. The decision for transfusion was based on specific criteria. The median values of the scores, those of the variables, and the median number of transfused RBC units of the surviving group were compared to the values of the group of patients who died during hospital stay. The quantity of RBC transfusions was compared to the variables and score values by linear regression analysis. Additionally, the values of the patients who did not receive blood transfusion were compared to those of patients who required RBC. Furthermore, the patient group with neurosurgical diseases was compared to the group without neurosurgical diseases.

But significant differences (p = 0.0001) were observed in the mean weight of the resected liver. Treatment with BOP alone resulted in the induction of well-differentiated ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma in 91%, while all groups treated with different amounts of ALA had induction of 100%. The incidence of liver metastases differed significantly between the groups. The incidence of liver metastases in group I (2.5% ALA) was 18%, in group II (5% ALA) 27%, in group III (7.5% ALA) 50%, and in group IV (10% ALA) 91%. Moreover, the diameter of liver metastases increased significantly according to ALA supplementation (p = 0.001).",

METHODS: The sample consisted of 165 primary school students (10-12 years old). Participants completed measures of emotional distress, exercise habit strength, and the Digit Span Test. Mid-year exam results were used as an indicator of academic performance. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to analyse the data. RESULTS: The results of SEM revealed an acceptable fit for the hypothesised model. Exercise habit was positively associated with short-term memory, and better short-term memory was associated with better academic performance. However, although an inverse relationship was found between emotional distress and short-term memory, a positive association was found between exercise habit strength and emotional distress.",

This offers an excellent opportunity to study potential heart failure survival improvements for a general patient population. METHODS: Vital status follow-up through 2001 was obtained from the Social Security Death Index for all 2323 patients aged>or=65 years at the time of an initial, medically managed heart failure hospitalization between October 1989 and March 2000. Kaplan Meier survival probabilities were compared across 4 time periods in the 1990s. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate age, sex, race and comorbidity-adjusted differences in survival among patients admitted in 1989-1991 and 3 subsequent multi-year periods. RESULTS: There was an increase in the proportion of older female patients with more chronic conditions. Compared with patients admitted in 1989-1991, survival probabilities for patients admitted in 1999-2000 had improved about 5% at 30 days (to 95%) and 10% at 1 year in 1999-2001 (to 73.5%). For those admitted between 1989-1998, there was a 9% improvement over 1989-1991 at 5 years (to 36%). Hazards model results indicated that patients admitted in 1999-2000 had a relative risk of death only 66% that of patients admitted in 1989-1991 (P<.0001).",

However, without some form of standardized methodology between laboratories, the correlation of results is difficult. METHODS: Using TaqMan-based assays, parallel quantitative real-time PCR analysis was performed on 70 clinical specimens at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Virginia Commonwealth University. While the same positive control cell line (K562) and quality control gene (BCR) were used, the RNA isolation technique, cDNA synthesis, BCR control cell line, and PCR primer and probe sequences were different. RESULTS: The detection of BCRABL-positive results spanned a dynamic range from 10(0) to 10(5)/100,000 cells. Forty-three samples were negative at both facilities. A Spearman rank correlation analysis was performed for the 22 BCRABL-positive paired results. The correlation coefficient, r(s), was 0.9435 (p<0.00001), suggesting a strong correlation of the results.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a computerised database of ambulance attendance records at non-fatal heroin overdose cases for the period 1/12/1998 to 31/7/2000 was undertaken. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measure was the rate of patient hospitalisation. The rate of CPR administration at heroin overdose cases was also examined, along with characteristics of the attendance, such as the age and sex of the overdose case, the relationship of person providing CPR to the overdose case as well as the location, time and date of the event. RESULTS: CPR was administered prior to ambulance arrival in 579 heroin overdose cases (9.4% of total heroin overdose cases attended) between 1/12/98 and 31/7/2000. A greater proportion of female overdose cases were administered CPR than males and CPR administrations were evenly distributed across attendances occurring in private and public locations. Bystander administration of CPR prior to ambulance attendance resulted in a significantly lower rate of heroin user hospitalisation (14.5%) compared to cases where bystander CPR was not administered (18.8%).",

It has been suggested that prolonging the duration of therapy might improve the treatment success. We tested whether prolonging treatment duration to 14-days would improve the results to 95% or greater eradication. METHODS: This was a multi-center, single site, pilot study in which H. pylori-infected patients received a 14-day sequential therapy (esomeprazole and amoxicillin for 7 days followed by esomeprazole, clarithromycin, and metronidazole for 7 days). H. pylori status was assessed 8 weeks after therapy. Success was defined as achieving 95% or greater eradication by per-protocol (PP) analysis. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-three subjects received the 14-day sequential therapy. The eradication rate was 93.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 89.5-98.3%) by PP and 91.9% (95% CI, 87.1-96.7%) by intention-to-treat analysis.

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: Postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) is still frequent complication after cardiac surgery in spite of the improvements in the surgical procedures. There is still controversy whether or not, the absence of cardiopulmonary bypass results in a lower incidence of AF. METHODS: Six hundred and seventy patients that underwent revascularization by using in situ LIMA for single vessel disease were included in this retrospective study and the patients were divided in two groups. Group I included 328 patients who underwent complete revascularization with cardiopulmonary bypass and group II consisted of 342 patients who underwent complete revascularization without cardiopulmonary bypass. Then, the incidence and predictive perioperative factors of AF in two groups were determined and compared with each other. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between two groups with respect to the preoperative demographic characteristics of the patients. The incidence of postoperative AF was determined as 16.1% after on-pump and 14.6% after off-pump revascularization. Avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass did not decrease the incidence of postoperative AF. Sex, age over 65 years, prophylactic beta-blocker usage and left ventricular dysfunction were independent predictive factors in group I (r2=0.51; P<0.001). However, only age over 65 years and prophylactic beta-blocker usage were independent predictive factors in group II (r2=0.59; P<0.01). The rates of AF in both groups were decreased by using prophylactic beta-blocker usage (P=0.05 in group I, P<0.001 in group II).",

Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels have been noted in minor populations of patients, and antibiotics may be prescribed under the impression of a suspected bacterial infection. This prescription might be inappropriate, resulting in further bacterial resistance and medical expense. The aim of this study was to delineate how effective antibiotics are for children suffering from enterovirus infection complicated with a high CRP level. METHODS: The medical records of children hospitalized between January 2008 and December 2012 with herpangina or hand, foot and mouth disease were reviewed retrospectively. The children enrolled were divided into three groups, A, B, and C, by CRP level, which were<40, 40-80, and \u2265 80 mg/l, respectively. A case-control study of group C divided into subgroups according to the prescription of antibiotics for at least 24h during the admission was conducted for further analysis. RESULTS: A total 3566 cases were identified; 214 were in group C and 71.0% of them received a prescription for antibiotics. There was a linear trend between a relatively higher CRP level and a higher proportion of antibiotics prescribed in the three groups (p=0.001).

METHODS: Both nails were compared on a series of 10 matched pairs of human femora. After setting a distal femur defect fracture, the intramedullary stabilized femur was axially loaded starting from 100 N, increasing in steps of 100 N after every 200 cycles with a triangular frequency of 1 Hz, until a predefined point of failure was reached. RESULTS: The two types of nails showed no significant difference in terms of maximum tolerated load, maximum number of cycles repeated, or axial deformation of the bone-implant construct. The mean load at failure was 2,954 N for the CN and 2,483 N for the LCN. The mean axial deformation for the conventional (14.8 mm) and locked compression nail (15.3 mm) did not differ significantly. Mode of failure was a bony fracture in all specimens predominantly involving the proximal femur.",

METHODS: We surveyed patients discharged from Massachusetts hospitals in 2003 to elicit information about negative effects associated with hospitalization. Physician reviewers judged whether patient-reported negative effects represented AEs, and classified the severity of the event. Likelihood ratios were calculated to assess whether patient responses to questionnaire items affected reviewers' judgments. RESULTS: Of the 2582 patients surveyed, 753 patients reported 1170 negative effects, and 71.2% of these effects were classified as AEs by physician reviewers. Negative effects most likely to be classified as AEs involved newly prescribed medications and changes to previously prescribed medications. Additional information elicited from follow-up survey questions modestly affected reviewers' classification of serious AEs. Negative effects reported by women, younger patients, those reporting better health status, and those not admitted through the emergency department were more likely to be classified as AEs.",

Few quantitative clinical or neurophysiological data specifically address the issue of tremor asymmetry in ET. OBJECTIVES: To examine a community-dwelling cohort of subjects with ET to (1) estimate the prevalence of tremor asymmetry and (2) quantify the magnitude of tremor asymmetry. METHODS: Fifty-four subjects with ET, identified in a community-based study of ET in New York City, underwent a Tremor Interview and a videotaped Tremor Examination. The examination included 6 tasks: sustained arm extension, pouring water, drinking water, using a spoon, finger-to-nose movements, and drawing spirals with each arm. Two neurologists rated the severity of tremor using a 0 to 3 clinical rating scale and a total tremor score was calculated (range, 0-36). Fourteen (25%) of 54 subjects also underwent quantitative computerized tremor analysis. RESULTS: The prevalence of asymmetry depended on the definition of asymmetry; small to moderate differences between sides were common. The mean side-to-side difference in clinical ratings for each of the 6 tasks was 0.54 of 3 points, which represented a 1.32-fold difference between sides. Clinical rating scores were higher in the nondominant arm in 39 subjects (72%), higher in the dominant arm in 9 (17%), and equal in 6 (11%). The 2 left-handed subjects had higher clinical ratings on the right.

RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis showed that gestational age (GA) at delivery (odds ratio (OR) = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.50-0.70), abdominal circumference (AC) centile (OR = 0.69; 95% CI, 0.59-0.81) and umbilical artery (UA) pulsatility index (PI) centile (OR = 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04) significantly correlated with adverse neonatal outcome. From this model we calculated a score of adverse neonatal outcome expressed by the formula: (UA-PI centile/3) - (10 x AC centile) + (10 x (40 - GA at delivery in weeks)). Receiver-operating characteristics curve analysis demonstrated that a score of>or = 25 optimally predicted adverse neonatal outcome (sensitivity of 75%, false-positive rate of 18%).

        "input": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of intralesional triamcinolone acetonide (TA) injection in primary and recurrent chalazia. DESIGN: Retrospective, interventional, consecutive case series. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred forty-seven patients with primary or recurrent chalazia (155 cases) treated at the oculoplastic clinic at the Jules Stein Eye Institute between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2003. METHODS: Patients received an intralesional injection of 0.1 to 0.2 ml TA (40 mg/ml). Data regarding lesion size, including digital color photography, lesion regression or recurrence, and complete ophthalmic examination, were recorded at the time of injection and at different intervals until resolution or surgical excision. Success was defined as at least an 80% decrease in size with no recurrence. If the lesion recurred or regression was minimal (<50%), further injections were given as needed. Patients who declined injection or who did not respond to 2 to 3 injections were referred for surgical excision and drainage. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Lesion size, clinical resolution, time to resolution, recurrence, and complications. RESULTS: Most of the patients received 1 injection (93 patients; 60%) or 2 injections (31 patients; 20%) with resolution of the lesion (more than 80% decrease in size), with an average time to resolution of 2.5 weeks. Patients who did not respond to 2 injections were more likely to fail treatment (minimal or no regression), to respond to further injections, or to undergo surgical excision and drainage (P = 0.0001, chi-square test). Patients with blepharitis had a significantly longer time to resolution (P = 0.0001, chi-square test).",

MDD is a heterogeneous disorder and the direction of its association with obesity remains unclear. Evidence grows that recurrent MDD (MDD-R) differs in etiology and prognosis from single episode MDD (MDD-S), which could affect associations with obesity. However, evidence on this differential effect is lacking. The aim of this study was to examine the direction of the association between obesity and MDD, single or recurrent episode. METHODS: A longitudinal study was performed in a cohort of 1094 participants of the PREVEND study, on whom data were collected at baseline and at an average 2-year follow-up. MDD-S and MDD-R were assessed by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 2.1). Obesity was defined as Body Mass Index \u2265 30 kg/m(2). Binary logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine whether obesity predicts MDD-S/MDD-R or vice versa, adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: Prospective analyses showed that BMI at baseline was associated with the onset of MDD-R (Odds ratio, OR = 1.32; 95% confidence interval, 95%CI: 1.11; 1.57) during 2-year follow-up, but not with the onset of MDD-S (OR = 0.98; 95%CI: 0.89; 1.07). Obesity at baseline was not associated with the onset of MDD-S during follow-up (OR = 0.75; 95%CI: 0.25; 2.30), but associated with the onset of MDD-R (OR = 1.32; 95%CI: 1.04; 1.68).",

Accounting for accommodative responses from a human factors perspective may be motivated by the interest of designing virtual image displays or by establishing an autonomic indicator that allows for remote measurement at the human eye. Heart period, pulse transit time, and the pupillary response were considered as reference for possible closed-loop accommodative effects. Cognitive demand was varied by presenting monocularly numbers at a viewing distance of 5 D (20 cm) which had to be read, added or multiplied; further, letters were presented in a \"n-back\" task. RESULTS: Cardiovascular parameters and pupil size indicated a change in autonomic balance, while error rates and reaction time confirmed the increased cognitive demand during task processing. An observed decrease in accommodation could not be attributed to the cognitive demand itself for two reasons: (1) the cognitive demand induced a shift in gaze direction which, for methodological reasons, accounted for a substantial part of the observed accommodative changes. (2) Remaining effects disappeared when the correctness of task processing was taken into account.",

Underlying mechanisms are not understood, but vascular shunting away from the gut could be responsible. Therefore, blood flow in the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and hepatic portal vein (HPV) was examined at sea level (SL) and after ascent to 4392 m (HA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve subjects [eight male, mean age 40 (22-72) years] were studied following an overnight fast and a standard meal. Cross-sectional vessel area and blood velocity were measured by ultrasound, systolic and diastolic flow calculated for the SMA (HR x vessel area x velocity, cm(3) min(-1)) and mean flow for the HPV. RESULTS: All subjects experienced reduced appetite at HA. Blood flow in the SMA and HPV increased following food at SL (mean SMA systolic flow 1024 vs. 3316 cm(3) min(-1), P<0.001; HPV 505 vs. 1789, P<0.001) and at HA (2020 vs. 3767, P<0.001; HPV 708 vs. 1727, P<0.001). Pre-prandial flow in the SMA and HPV was significantly increased at HA compared with SL. The changes were due to increased vessel diameter and increased flow velocity. There was no difference in post-prandial flow between SL and HA in the HPV, although the increase in post-prandial flow was greater at SL than HA (254% increase vs. 144%).",

Our academic surgical group, who perform all operative cases with resident physicians, has been challenged to reduce expenses in this era of cost containment. We recognize resident training is an expensive commodity that is poorly reimbursed, and hypothesized laparoscopic appendectomy was too expensive to justify resident teaching of this procedure. The purpose of this study was to determine if laparoscopic appendectomy is more expensive than open appendectomy. METHODS: From April 2003 to April 2004, all patients undergoing appendectomy for presumed acute appendicitis at our university-affiliated teaching hospital were reviewed; demographic data, equipment charge, minutes in the operating room (OR), hospital length of stay, and total hospital charge were analyzed. OR minute charges were gradated based on equipment use and level of skilled nursing care. Conversions to open appendectomy were included in the laparoscopic group for analysis. RESULTS: During the study period, 247 patients underwent appendectomy for preoperative diagnosis of acute appendicitis, with 152 open (113 inflamed, 37 perforated, 2 normal), 88 laparoscopic (69 inflamed, 12 perforated, 7 normal), and 7 converted (2 inflamed, 4 perforated, 1 normal) operations performed.

In some cases, this leads us to operate when an underlying infection is present. In this study, we evaluated the infection rate of bipolar hemiarthroplasty after femoral neck fracture and attempted to relate it to preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The infection rate of bipolar hemiarthroplasty was evaluated in a dual-center, retrospective study of 260 patients over a 2-year period. During the first year, the preoperative CRP levels were not taken into account when scheduling the procedure. During the second year, if preoperative CRP levels were above 50 mg/L, the procedure was delayed to look for and treat any ongoing infections. RESULTS: The overall periprosthetic infection rate in this study was 4.85 % (range 4.8-4.9), with 33 % of patients passing within 1 year due to the infection. In the group where CRP was not taken into consideration, 59 of the 143 operated away patients (41 %) had their preoperative CRP levels measured. Twenty-nine of these patients had CRP>50 mg/L when they were operated. Of the seven infections in the group, one patient had CRP>50 mg/L, two had CRP<50 mg/L, and four patients did not have preoperative CRP levels measured. In the group where CRP was taken into consideration, 104 of the 117 patients (89 %) had their preoperative CRP assessment. Thirty of these patients had CRP>50 mg/L upon admission; their procedure was delayed, and none of them had an infection.",

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate spontaneous endometrial apoptosis in women with unexplained infertility and to find out whether there is a possible relationship between endometrial apoptosis, age, and hormonal parameters. STUDY DESIGN: This study was designed as a prospective, case-controlled study in a University Hospital setting. A total of 34 endometrial biopsies were performed from 17 women with unexplained infertility and 17 fertile controls, who were admitted for tubal ligation. Endometrium was sampled on the seventh post-ovulatory day. On the same day of endometrial sampling, serum levels of FSH, LH, PRL, TSH, E2, progesterone, 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, testosterone and DHEA-S were determined. Endometrial glandular and stromal apoptosis were investigated by DNA nick end labeling (TUNEL) method on each sample. Endometrial apoptotic index was calculated and correlated with age and hormonal parameters. RESULTS: There was no difference in either endometrial glandular apoptotic index (AI) or stromal AI between the groups. However, the mean glandular AI was significantly higher than the mean stromal AI (p = 0.0001). There was a strong correlation between endometrial AI and age (r = 0.91, p = 0.02). Serum T levels were significantly found to be decreased in the unexplained infertility group (p = 0.0001). In addition, serum TSH levels were positively correlated with AI in the glandular endometrium in women with unexplained infertility (r = 0.611, p = 0.009).",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pretreatment HRQOL was measured in 391 advanced NSCLC patients using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the EORTC Lung Cancer module (QLQ-LC13). The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for both univariate and multivariate analyses of survival. In addition, a bootstrap validation technique was used to assess the stability of the outcomes. RESULTS: The final multivariate Cox regression model retained four parameters as independent prognostic factors for survival: male gender with a hazard ratio (HR) = 1.32 (95% CI 1.03-1.69; P = 0.03); performance status (0 to 1 versus 2) with HR = 1.63 (95% CI 1.04-2.54; P = 0.032); patient's self-reported score of pain with HR= 1.11 (95% CI 1.07-1.16; P<0.001) and dysphagia with HR = 1.12 (95% CI 1.04-1.21; P = 0.003).

        "input": "OBJECT: Pedicle subtraction osteotomy (PSO) is a surgical procedure that is frequently performed on patients with sagittal spinopelvic malalignment. Although it allows for substantial spinopelvic realignment, suboptimal realignment outcomes have been reported in up to 33% of patients. The authors' objective in the present study was to identify differences in radiographic profiles and surgical procedures between patients achieving successful versus failed spinopelvic realignment following PSO. METHODS: This study is a multicenter retrospective consecutive PSO case series. The authors evaluated 99 cases involving patients who underwent PSO for sagittal spinopelvic malalignment. Because precise cutoffs of acceptable residual postoperative sagittal vertical axis (SVA) values have not been well defined, comparisons were focused between patient groups with a postoperative SVA that could be clearly considered either a success or a failure. Only cases in which the patients had a postoperative SVA of less than 50 mm (successful PSO realignment) or more than 100 mm (failed PSO realignment) were included in the analysis. Radiographic measures and PSO parameters were compared between successful and failed PSO realignments. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients met the inclusion criteria. Successful realignment was achieved in 61 patients (77%), while realignment failed in 18 (23%). Patients with failed realignment had larger preoperative SVA (mean 217.9 vs 106.7 mm, p<0.01), larger pelvic tilt (mean 36.9\u00b0 vs 30.7\u00b0, p<0.01), larger pelvic incidence (mean 64.2\u00b0 vs 53.7\u00b0, p<0.01), and greater lumbar lordosis-pelvic incidence mismatch (-47.1\u00b0 vs -30.9\u00b0, p<0.01) than patients with successful realignment. The mean number of pedicles removed was also greater in the failed group (2.2 vs 1.7, p<0.01).",
        "output": "The present study demonstrates that patients with a postoperative SVA of less than 50 mm following PSO surgery are likely to achieve successful sagittal realignment. In contrast, patients with a postoperative SVA of more than 100 mm are likely to have failed realignment. The authors' findings suggest that the number of pedicles removed and the degree of lumbar lordosis-pelvic incidence mismatch may be important factors in determining the likelihood of successful PSO realignment."

Nevertheless, some urologists avoid closed suction drains after partial nephrectomy mainly because of a theoretical increased risk of a prolonged urinary leak or delayed hemorrhage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the records of 184 patients who underwent 197 consecutive partial nephrectomies at our institution. Closed suction or open passive (Penrose) drainage was used based on surgeon preference. Drain type was compared with duration of use and the incidence of relevant complications. RESULTS: A Penrose drain was used in 37.6% (74 of 197) of partial nephrectomies and a closed suction drain was used in 62.4% (123). Clinical characteristics were equivalent between both groups, including age, body mass index, tumor size (mean 3.1 cm), number of renal tumors excised, estimated blood loss and operative time. There was no statistically significant difference in the duration of drainage between the Penrose group (mean 7.1 days) and the closed suction group (7.8 days). While we found variation in the incidence of relevant complications by drain type, none of these differences was statistically significant. Complications included prolonged urinary drainage in 7.6% of cases (8.9% closed suction, 5.4% Penrose), wound infection or perinephric abscess in 3.6% (2.4% closed suction, 5.4% Penrose) and delayed hemorrhage in 1.5% (2.4% closed suction, 0 Penrose).",

The recording of an AP potential is an excellent guide for selection of ablation site. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the pathway potential is always a fast potential. METHODS: Ten patients (six females, mean age, 30 +/- 12 years) with preexcited tachycardias involving a Mahaim pathway underwent electrophysiological study and subsequent attempts at RF ablation. Mahaim potentials (M-potential) recorded at the site of successful ablation were reviewed and classified by at least two reviewers. RESULTS: In all patients, Mahaim pathways were characterized as atriofascicular types. The M-potential was fast in seven patients (group one), and slow in the remaining patients (group two). All group two patients had a history of prior failed ablation. Atrial electrograms were recorded closer to the QRS onset in group one. Atrium to fast M-potential (42 +/- 15 ms) was shorter than atrium to slow M-potential (83 +/- 12 ms, P = 0.03) but M-potentials were recorded with similar distance before local ventricular electrogram (P = NS). Ablation was successful in all patients with mean of 2.9 +/- 1.4 RF applications per patient. Ablation data were similar between the two groups (P = NS). No complications occurred. During 12 months of follow-up, no recurrence was observed.",

Hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) has been recommended as adjuvant therapy for NF, improving patient mortality and outcome. However, the beneficial effect of HBO for NF remains controversial. METHODS: A retrospective evaluation of treatment outcome in 37 patients treated for NF between 1984 and 1993 was carried out. The mortality rate, morbidity criteria, and risk factors for grave prognosis were compared between a group of 25 patients who received HBO as part of their treatment protocol and a group of the remaining 12 patients treated by surgical excision and antibiotics alone. RESULTS: The two groups were found to be similar with regard to age, gender, the incidence of individual risk factors for ominous prognosis, and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score for disease's severity on presentation. The mortality rate among the HBO-treated patients was 36%, as opposed to 25% in the non-HBO group. The mean number of surgical d\u00e9bridements required per patient was significantly higher in the HBO group: 3.3 compared with 1.5 in the non-HBO-treated patients. Although the average length of hospitalization for survivors was shorter for the HBO group, the difference between the groups did not reach statistical significance.",

However, their predictive ability remains controversial. We examined the association between USMLE scores and success in surgical residency. METHODS: We compared USMLE scores for 123 general surgical residents who trained in the past 20\u00a0years and their performance evaluation. Scores were normalized to the mean for the testing year and expressed as a ratio (1 = mean). Performances were evaluated by (1) rotation evaluations; (2) \"dropouts;\" (3) overall American Board of Surgery pass rate; (4) first-time American Board of Surgery pass rate; and (5) a retrospective comprehensive faculty evaluation. For the latter, 16 surgeons (average faculty tenure 22\u00a0years) rated residents on a 1 to 4 score (1 = fair; 4 = excellent). RESULTS: Rotation evaluations by faculty and \"drop out\" rates were not associated with USMLE score differences (dropouts had average above the mean). One hundred percent of general surgery practitioners achieved board certification regardless of USMLE score but trainees with an average above the mean had a higher first-time pass rate (P = .04). Data from the comprehensive faculty evaluations were conflicting: there was a moderate degree of correlation between board scores and faculty evaluations (r\u00a0= .287, P = .001).

Therefore, the aims of the present study were to determine whether supraspinatus initiates shoulder abduction by activating prior to movement and significantly earlier than other shoulder muscles and to determine if load or plane of movement influenced the recruitment timing of supraspinatus. METHODS: Electromyographic recordings were taken from seven shoulder muscles of fourteen volunteers during shoulder abduction in the coronal and scapular planes and a plane 30\u00b0 anterior to the scapular plane, at 25%, 50% and 75% of maximum load. Initial activation timing of a muscle was determined as the time at which the average activation (over a 25 ms moving window) was greater than three standard deviations above baseline measures. RESULTS: All muscles tested were activated prior to movement onset. Subscapularis was activated significantly later than supraspinatus, infraspinatus, deltoid and upper trapezius, while supraspinatus, infraspinatus, upper trapezius, lower trapezius, serratus anterior and deltoid all had similar initial activation times.

The analysis sample includes 27,257 nonelderly individuals covered by private insurance. STUDY DESIGN: Based on insurer reports, individuals are grouped into one of the four insurance product types. Measures of service use include ambulatory visits, preventive care use, hospital use, surgeries, specialist use, and whether there is a usual source of care. Consumer assessments of care include unmet or delayed care needs, satisfaction with health care, ratings of the last physician visit, and trust in physicians. Estimates are adjusted to control for differences in individual characteristics and location. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: As one moves from indemnity insurance to PPOs to open model HMOs to closed model HMOs, use of primary care increases modestly but use of specialists is reduced. Few differences are observed in other areas of service use, such as preventive care, hospital use, and surgeries. The likelihood of having unmet or delayed care does not vary by insurance type, but the reasons that underlie such access problems do vary: enrollees in more managed products are less likely to cite financial barriers to care but are more likely to perceive problems in provider access, convenience, and organizational factors. Consumer assessments of care-including satisfaction with care, ratings of the last physician visit, and trust in physicians-are generally similar across insurance types.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Chemotherapy treatment of childhood cancer may impair gonadal function, which may be manifested only in adulthood as permanent sterility. Detection of gonadal dysfunction in prepubertal children has been hampered by the absence of a sensitive marker. Inhibin B is secreted by small antral follicles and Sertoli cells in females and males, respectively, and may be a marker of gonadal function in prepubertal children. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate inhibin B in relation to sensitive measurements of gonadotrophins as markers of the early gonadotoxic effects of chemotherapy in prepubertal children treated for cancer. STUDY DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: Twenty-five prepubertal children (9 females), median age 4.5 years (range 1.2-12.8 years) with cancer (16 solid tumours, nine acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, ALL) were studied longitudinally. Blood samples were collected before and during chemotherapy (solid tumours) or immediately following induction and first intensification (ALL). Post-treatment (1-6 months) samples were collected in 12 of the patients (5 females). MEASUREMENTS: Dimeric inhibin B was measured by double antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). FSH and LH were measured by sensitive time-resolved immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Girls: Pretreatment inhibin B was slightly high in one girl but normal for age and sex in all others: median 16.1 (range 9.4-186.2) ng/l, median SD score +0.2 (-1.3 to +2.6). Inhibin B decreased to undetectable levels (<8 ng/l) in all girls during chemotherapy and remained low in all girls for at least 6 months post-treatment. Boys: Pretreatment inhibin B was normal for age and sex in all boys: median 12.2 (range 4.2-22.2) ng/l, median SD score +0.2 (-0.2 to +0.8). Inhibin B decreased to undetectable levels (<8 ng/l) in all boys during chemotherapy and remained low in all boys for at least 6 months post-treatment.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a frequent finding in young patients with stroke. The aim of this study was to assess whether PFO is a family trait. METHODS: Sixty-two consecutive patients younger than 60 years of age with ischemic stroke and 62 age and gender-matched control siblings were examined by means of contrast transcranial Doppler (TCD) of the middle cerebral artery, using a standardized protocol. The reliability of TCD examination in our laboratory was assessed against transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). All TCD recordings were reviewed by a blinded experienced observer from another center. Disagreements between readers were resolved by unblinded consensus review. RESULTS: Siblings of patients with PFO had a significantly higher prevalence of PFO than had siblings of patients without PFO (61.5% versus 30.6%; OR 3.64 [1.3 to 10.5]; P=0.015). The kappa statistics indicated that agreement of pairs (patients/control siblings) was not due to chance. The strength of the association was sex dependent. In women pairs, prevalence of a PFO was 76.5% in siblings of patients with PFO and 25% in siblings of patients without PFO, giving an OR of 9.8 (95% CI 2 to 47.9; P<0.01). In contrast, in men, no significant difference was observed in the prevalence of PFO between siblings of patients with or without PFO (respectively 33.3% and 35%), giving an OR of 0.9 (95% CI 0.2 to 4.9; P=0.9).",

San Francisco jails performed targeted chlamydia screening and treatment since 1996. GOAL: To determine this program's impact on chlamydia positivity among females attending neighborhood medical clinics. STUDY DESIGN: During 1997-2004, jail testing density, a measure of the proportion of persons from year 2000 census blocks that were tested in jail, was compared by neighborhood. Chlamydia positivity among females aged 15 to 25 years were compared at 2 clinics serving areas with different jail testing densities. RESULTS: Of persons offered screening at intake, 89% accepted. A total of 42,952 tests were performed among 23,561 persons in jail (45% black, 73% male). A total of 2765 (6.4%) tests were positive for chlamydia; 81% of chlamydial infections were treated. Jail testing density significantly correlated with neighborhood female chlamydia rates. Mean jail testing density at Clinic S, calculated by using the residence of persons tested for chlamydia, was 7 times greater than that at Clinic O. Chlamydia positivity declined at Clinic S from 16.1% to 7.8% (Ptrend<0.001). No significant change occurred at Clinic O in chlamydia (4.7% in 1997 and 2004, Ptrend = 0.81).",

(1992) demonstrated that visual evoked activity of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) can be recorded on the frontolateral epidural surface of macaque monkeys. So far it is not known whether analogous visual evoked potentials can be found on the scalp surface of humans. METHODS: The search for early visual evoked responses was performed in healthy volunteers with the following technique: white Ganzfeld-flash stimulation (<100 \u00b5sec, 0.81 cd/m2s, frequency 1.1 Hz), low frequency filter 1 Hz, high frequency filter 100 Hz (12 db/octave), averaging of 100 stimulations. A topographic map of responses was recorded at standard electroencephalography scalp positions. In addition to these methods the following parameters were modified: stimulation (flash versus checkerboard reversal, monocular versus binocular), recording of right and left hemisphere responses, frequency filtering and frequency analysis. RESULTS: Scalp mapping of VEP responses indicated an early reproducible response with a wide frontolateral distribution consisting of a small positive and a larger negative potential (= GER - presumed geniculatum evoked response). A closer analysis of responses was performed at 6 different standard electroencephalography scalp positions electrode positions (F2, F4, FC2, FC4, FC6, C4) in 7 healthy volunteers. At FC4 the amplitude of the GER was maximal (4.8 \u00b1 2.9 \u00b5V). The peak latencies were: positive wave 31.8 \u00b1 2.8 msec, negative wave 43.6 \u00b1 2.3 msec. Monocular stimulation resulted in nearly identical responses on both hemispheres. Amplitudes increase at binocular stimulation by + 1.2 \u00b1 0.8 \u00b5V. The frequency analysis of the GER revealed a peak at 1.1 Hz.",

We carried out this research to investigate the need for dissection of station 9 lymph nodes during lung cancer surgery. METHODS: Patients with primary lung cancer who underwent radical surgery between 2010 and 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical, pathologic, and prognosis data were obtained and analyzed. RESULTS: A total number of 1397 patients were included in this research. The metastasis rate of station 9 was 3.45%, which was significantly lower than other mediastinal stations. This metastasis rate was significantly correlated with pT stage, the lobe where the tumor was located, metastasis status of intrapulmonary lymph nodes, pTNM stage, and most of the other mediastinal lymph node stations. In males or ground glass opacity (GGO) patients, the metastasis of station 9 nodes was more unlikely to occur, even though there was no statistical significance. The staging results of most patients (99.63%) would not be impaired, even if station 9 nodes were not dissected, and the prognostic analysis showed that the metastasis status of station 9 had no significant influence on survival.",

METHODS: A total of 925 low-income African-American, Mexican-American, and Caucasian pregnant adolescents aged</= 18 years were interviewed on the postpartum ward of a university hospital within 48 hours of delivery. Correlates of stigma were identified among self-reported behaviors such as substance use, exposure to violence, family support and criticism, as well as reproductive and sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: Two out of five adolescents (39.1%) reported feeling stigmatized by their pregnancy. As compared with their nonstigmatized peers, stigmatized adolescents were more likely to report having seriously considered abortion, being afraid to tell parents about pregnancy, feeling that parents/teachers thought pregnancy a mistake, and feeling abandoned by the fathers of their babies. Stepwise logistic regression revealed the following correlates independently associated with feeling stigmatized: white race/ethnicity, not being legally/common-law married or engaged to the baby's father, feelings of social isolation, aspirations to complete college, experiencing verbal abuse or being fearful of being hurt by other teenagers, and experiencing family criticism.

All pregnant women were admitted to the hospital in each trimester of pregnancy for control of carbohydrate metabolism and follow-up of pregnancy. All pregnant women were treated by intensified Insulin regime-type basal-prandial. The diet was set according to the needs during pregnancy. 30 pregnant women (group 1) were educated according to the specificity of diabetes during pregnancy. The education was repeated every time the patient was admitted to the hospital. The aim of education was to reach and maintain good metabolic control (HbA1c<7.5%) in the course of pregnancy. The values of HbA1c before education in group 1 and after final education in group 2 (not educated) were determinated. The incidence of some maternal and perinatal complication-the progress from diabetic nonproliferative retinopathy into proliferative retinopathy, the development of preeclampsia as a causative factor for delivery before 37 g.w, the development of RDS and perinatal deaths were evaluated. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the mean values of glycosylated Hb. In the group of educated women a good metabolic control was achieved--HbA1c = 7.5%.

Information describing the relationship between preoperative intake blood pressure and primary care measurements could help anesthesiologists make primary care referrals for improved blood pressure control in an evidence-based fashion. We hypothesized that the preoperative examination provides a useful basis for initiating primary care blood pressure referral. METHODS: We analyzed retrospective data on 2807 patients who arrived from home for surgery and who were subsequently evaluated within 6 months after surgery in the primary care center of the same institution. After descriptive analysis, we conducted multiple linear regression analysis to identify day-of-surgery (DOS) factors associated with subsequent primary care blood pressure. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value of different blood pressure referral thresholds using both a single-measurement and a 2-stage screen incorporating recent preoperative and DOS measurements for identifying patients with subsequently elevated primary care blood pressure. RESULTS: DOS systolic blood pressure (SBP) was higher than subsequent primary care SBP by a mean bias of 5.5 mm Hg (95% limits of agreement + 43.8 to -32.8). DOS diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was higher than subsequent primary care DBP by a mean bias of 1.5 mm Hg (95% limits of agreement +13.0 to -10.0). Linear regression of DOS factors explained 19% of the variability in primary care SBP and 29% of the variability in primary care DBP. The sensitivity of a single-measurement screen for subsequent primary care hypertension was 84% for SBP and 82% for DBP. The sensitivity of a 2-stage screen was 88% for SBP and 86% for DBP.",

        "input": "INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to test the null hypothesis that increased irregularity of the mandibular incisors is associated with a reduction in the alveolar support on cone-beam computed tomographic sections. METHODS: From a sample of 1100 digital volumetric tomographs, 125 tomographs of subjects with Class I malocclusion (mean age, 21.6 \u00b1 4.8 years) were selected for this study. An irregularity index was used to categorize these tomographs as having mild, moderate, or severe crowding. All tomographs were taken by using an iCAT (Imaging Sciences International, Hatfield, Pa) imaging device. The following parameters were measured on the sections corresponding to the 4 mandibular incisors with the iCAT software: height, thickness, and area of the entire symphysis; height, thickness, and area of the cancellous bone of the symphysis; and distance between the vestibular and lingual cortices. For the statistical evaluation, independent samples t test, analysis of variance, and the Tukey HSD test were used at an alpha level 0.05. The Pearson correlation coefficient and a simple linear regression were calculated to determine the relationship between mandibular anterior bony support and incisor crowding. RESULTS: Almost all mandibular anterior bone measurements were greater in the male subjects than in the female subjects (height of the mandibular symphysis, P<0.001; cancellous bone height, P<0.001). Female subjects with mild crowding had higher values for cancellous bone height (P = 0.025) and vestibular cancellous bone thickness (P = 0.004) than did those with severe crowding. However, no differences were detected in the male subjects. Additionally, significant correlations were determined between incisor crowding and thickness of the mandibular symphysis (r = 0.22, P = 0.001) and cancellous bone thickness (r = 0.21, P = 0.001).",

METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conduced in all nursing homes of the Assistance-Publique-H\u00f4pitaux de Paris (AP-HP), the French largest public hospital group. All AP-HP nursing home patients (4,403) who were institutionalized in May, 2003, were concerned. The MRs of patients between three periods (before, during and after the August 2003 heat wave period) were compared according to their demographic characteristics, level of dependence and medical condition. RESULTS: The MR increased from 2.2 per cent persons month (ppm) (1.9-2.4) before heat wave up to 9.2 ppm (8.0-10.4) during heat wave and back to 2.4 ppm (2.2-2.7) after heat wave. MRs before heat wave were higher among highly dependent patients compared to those less dependent [mortality rate ratio (MRR) = 2.66 (1.69-4.21)]. This difference disappeared during the heat wave [MRR = 1.28 (0.91-1.81)]and appeared again after heat wave [MRR = 2.21 (1.52-3.23)].

        "input": "INTRODUCTION: Stage III NSCLC patients are candidates for treatment with curative intent. Current guidelines advise post contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or contrast enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT) of the brain in these patients to exclude brain metastases (BM). In previous small studies MRI was reported to be superior to CE-CT. However, CT and MR technology have evolved and 18F-deoxyglucose-positron-emission-tomography (18FDG-PET) has been implemented in staging of NSCLC. If CE-CT, performed together with 18FDG-PET-CT shows the same yield of BM detection as an additionally performed MRI, substantial gain in time and resources is expected. METHODS: All NSCLC patients who underwent a staging 18FDG-PET-CT between January 2008 and September 2011 were reviewed. Neurological asymptomatic patients with stage III NSCLC who were eligible for treatment with curative intent were selected, without taking into account the results of brain MRI. CT was compared to MRI to investigate whether additional BM were detected on MRI. Development of BM within a year after negative MRI was recorded. RESULTS: 97/429 NSCLC patients who underwent a PET-CT had stage III disease. Three otherwise stage III patients already had occult BM on CE-CT. 77/97 (79%) patients underwent MRI, 45/77 (58%) CE-CT and 32/77 (42%) LD-CT. In none of the CE-CT, but in 5/32 (16%) LD-CT patients BM were detected on MRI. 9/72 patients (13%) without BM on MRI developed BM within a year after negative MRI.",

METHODS: Dynamic 18F-FET PET studies (0-40 min after injection of 180 MBq of 18F-FET) were performed on 45 glioma patients with suspected tumor recurrence after multimodal treatment. For the standard method, tumoral maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and the ratio to the background were derived from a summed image 20-40 min after injection. Dynamic data evaluation comprised several approaches: first, SUV within a 90% isocontour threshold (SUV90) and the respective ratio to the background calculated for each time frame between 5 and 40 min after injection; second, the time to peak analysis; and third, various parameters accounting for the individual time course of 18F-FET uptake. Results were correlated with the histopathologic findings of MRI/PET-guided stereotactic biopsies and were evaluated with respect to their discriminatory power to separate low- from high-grade tumors using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. RESULTS: The parameters taking into account the individual time course of 18F-FET uptake were able to differentiate low-grade from high-grade recurrent astrocytomas with high diagnostic accuracy, reaching the best differentiation with a sensitivity and specificity of 92% and an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.94. For the other parameters, the respective values were considerably lower (AUC 0.82-0.88).",

We explored three methodological challenges to monitoring changes in sanitation coverage across socio-economic and demographic determinants: (i) confounding by wealth indices including water and sanitation assets, (ii) use of individual urban and rural settings versus national wealth indices and (iii) child-level versus household-level analyses. METHODS: Sanitation coverage by wealth for children and households across settings was estimated from recent Demographic and Health Surveys in six low-income countries. Household assignment to wealth quintiles was based on principal components analyses of assets. Concordance in household quintile assignment and estimated distribution of improved sanitation was assessed using two wealth indices differing by inclusion or exclusion of water and sanitation assets and independently derived for each setting. Improved sanitation was estimated using under five children and households. RESULTS: Wealth indices estimated with water, and sanitation assets are highly correlated with indices excluding them but can overstate disparities in sanitation access. Independently, derived setting wealth indices highly correlate with setting estimates of coverage using a single national index. Sanitation coverage and quintile disparities were consistently lower in household-level estimates.",

This study aimed to examine how hepatopancreatobiliary (HPB) surgeons approach the management of patients with hepatic colorectal cancer metastases (HCCM). METHODS: A web-based survey utilizing 10 clinical scenarios was distributed by e-mail to 37 HPB surgeons in Ontario, Canada. The study region has a population of approximately 13 million people and a universal, single-payer health care system. Descriptive analyses were used to tabulate results. RESULTS: Twenty-two (59%) surgeons responded to the survey. The majority (19/22, 86%) of respondents favoured neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with multiple synchronous and unilobar metastases; only nine of 22 (41%) respondents favoured neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with a single synchronous metastasis. In the setting of residual resectable disease following downstaging chemotherapy, 77% (17/22) of surgeons advocated hepatic resection with either radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or wedge resection of the 'ghost' lesions. Over 80% of surgeons would perform a liver and pulmonary resection in a patient with hepatic and multiple unilobar lung metastases. None would offer liver resection to patients with multiple retroperitoneal node involvement, although 55% (12/22) would do so if a single retroperitoneal node was involved.

METHODS: A total of 80,565 Papanicolaou (Pap) smears underwent RPS during a 25-month period. A sample was designated as \"review for abnormality\" (R) if any abnormal cells (at the threshold of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance/atypical glandular cells [AGC]) were thought to be present or was designated as negative (N) if none were detected. Each sample then underwent full screening (FS) and was designated as either R or N and also given a cytologic interpretation. RESULTS: The final cytologic interpretation was a glandular cell abnormality (\u2265AGC) in 107 samples (0.13%); 39 of these (36.4%) were flagged as R on RPS. Twenty-four patients (33.8%) out of 71 who had histologic follow-up were found to harbor a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or carcinoma; 13 of those 24 Pap smears (54.2%) had been flagged as R on RPS.

Measurements included fasting lipids and lipoproteins and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level measured using a Behring Nephelometer Analyzer System. RESULTS: High CRP level was equally prevalent whether the designated triglyceride cutpoint was greater than or equal to 100 (unadjusted OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.7-2.3) or greater than or equal to 150 (unadjusted OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.6-2.2).

        "input": "PURPOSE: Recent outbreaks of microbial keratitis have increased concerns about the efficacy of multipurpose solutions (MPS) against 'real-world' organisms. This study determined, in accordance with FDA/ISO standard methods, the effects of five MPS against clinical isolates and type strains of bacteria, and isolates of fungi from subjects' ocular structures; and of three MPS against environmental fungal isolates. METHOD: MPS were challenged with bacteria (type strains (ATCC) and clinical isolates of bacterial pathogens obtained from a district hospital laboratory) and with fungal isolates from both the periocular and conjunctival structures and from environmental air. RESULTS: All MPS demonstrated at least a 3-log reduction of challenged cell viability of all bacterial species tested, with the exception of MPS D against a canine infection Staphylococcus aureus isolate. Whilst all MPS tested were able to effect a 1.0-log reduction of viability of Fusarium solani (ATCC 36031), only two MPS had 90% viability reduction against all fungi of human origin and only one of these against all environmental fungal isolates. Effectiveness of these two solutions against fungal isolates compared to the remaining three MPS was found to be statistically significant (p = 0.003).",

This is indeed a worrying finding, and indicates the need to look at how these incidents are handled or indeed, what is done to minimize their occurrence. The Department of Health, via the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) published a guide which is aimed at encouraging accurate reporting, learning from past events and changing the attitudes of key stakeholders (healthcare managers, frontline staf etc) towards risk taking and risk management. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to compare informally-learned and used risk assessment strategies volunteered by staff with the 'how to do it' guide published by the NPSA. We have compared each step of the NPSA guide with our empirical data relating to that activity. METHODS: We interviewed forty-eight healthcare professionals (doctors from several specialties; nurses from a variety of settings; and an array of allied healthcare professionals). We used semi-structured interviews in order to discuss participants' views on their everyday working life, working relationships and patient safety. RESULTS: Our results indicate that healthcare professionals develop their own unique way to approach the issue of patient safety and risk, based on their professional raining, seniority and role within the hospital. They did share the conviction that frontline and support staff need to have immediate and easy access to information about past adverse events. They see this as a powerful tool in minimizing the reoccurrence of the same errors/problems, as well as a vehicle to improve staff morale by feeling valued and having their opinion heard.",
        "output": "Our findings suggest that the NPSA guide should be supplemented with a more informal approach to risk assessment, which is tailored to the individual's needs and the specific context. This approach should be encouraged and supported by the hospital management, as it is likely to be more effective in improving patient safety."

METHODS: In 553 patients we studied the presence of relevant changes according to standard definitions on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Nine-Hole Peg Test (9HPT), Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) and the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29). We examined 'exclusive worsening' (worsening on one measure while not worsening on any other measure) and 'opposing changes' (worsening on one measure while improving on another measure). Finally, we investigated the impact of combining assessments. RESULTS: Based on the EDSS alone, 140 patients progressed. However, almost twice as many (275) showed worsening on any of the clinical outcome measures. Exclusive worsening was observed in 37 patients on the EDSS, 13 on the 9HPT, 39 on the T25FW and 44 on the MSIS physical.

        "input": "PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine the differences in primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) surgical time and operation room (OR) work efficiency between inpatient and ambulatory facilities within the same institution. METHODS: Patients studied included those who underwent primary ACLR at either the inpatient hospital or the ambulatory facility by a single orthopaedic surgeon on elective surgery days. Time variables were calculated for ACLR to compare the 2 facilities. The OR work efficiency was calculated as the percentage of work that was completed before mid-day that was determined by the midpoint of the surgical day at each facility. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-seven ACLR surgeries were performed on 187 elective surgery days, 153 surgeries at the inpatient facility and 74 at the outpatient facility. The mean age at the time of surgery was 14.9\u00b12.2 years. The ACLR surgeries at the ambulatory facility were of shorter duration than those at the inpatient facility (P<0.0001). One OR was most commonly utilized and 2 to 3 surgeries were performed on most surgery days at both facilities. Seven nurses served as alternating circulators at the ambulatory facility compared with 41 nurses serving in the same capacity at the inpatient facility. The median turnover time was longer at the inpatient facility compared with the ambulatory facility. OR work efficiency (work done before mid-day) was 72.5% at the ambulatory facility and 49.5% at the inpatient facility, P<0.0001. If 2 ACLR surgeries were performed consecutively, the surgery day lasted for 6 hours at the hospital-owned ambulatory surgery center compared with 9 hours at the hospital-owned inpatient facility.",

Computerized prevention modules may facilitate such a strategy in general practice. OBJECTIVES: We established the applicability of a computerized influenza prevention module and specifically addressed improvement of immunization coverage in high-risk patients during two consecutive influenza vaccination rounds after introduction of the module. METHODS: In this descriptive study, four computerized practices of the Utrecht General Practices Network, covering about 36000 patients, participated. In 1995, all patients with high-risk diseases were traced by relevant tags, ICPC- and ATC-codes, using the module. According to changed Dutch immunization guidelines in 1996, healthy elderly people over 65 years were also traced. Demographical and medical data included age, high-risk disease and vaccine uptake. RESULTS: In October 1995, 3871 high-risk patients were identified (11% of population); overall vaccination coverage was 68%. Over one-third of these patients had not been indicated before. In between the two vaccination rounds, 1104 previously unknown patients with high-risk disease<65 years were found by means of the module's on-line status. In October 1996, 6889 persons, including 2308 healthy elderly, were indicated (19%), and vaccination coverage was 62%. Of 3477 patients whose high-risk diseases were documented in both vaccination rounds, an overall improvement of vaccination coverage from 71 % in 1995 to 76% in 1996 was observed (P<0.05).

Item 8 of the instrument, assessing 'Other mental and behavioral problems', is particularly relevant for patients with affective disorders, anxiety disorders, and eating and personality disorders. However, some studies have shown that the scale possesses unsatisfactory psychometric properties. The objective of the present study was therefore to validate the psychometric properties of a more specified version of the HoNOS-D item 8. METHODS: The instrument's reliability and validity were tested using a large, representative, clinical sample of patients with mental disorders (study 1: n = 1,918 and n = 1,357). Additional tests of reliability and criterion validity were performed using a further clinical sample of patients with mental disorders (study 2: N = 55). RESULTS: The extended version of the HoNOS provides a differentiated picture of additional problem areas for the patient. Although inter-rater reliability indicates a need for more detailed instructions, the problem areas of item 8 proved on the whole to be suitable for measuring the extent and severity of mental problems that are present in addition to the primary problem.",

Retrospectively comparing the records in Taiwan's Cancer registry, 1283 cancers were detected (4.1 per 1000). Of the total, 176 (0.6 per 1000) initial mammographic negative assessments were reported to have cancers (128 traditional films and 48 laser-printed digital images). We selected 186 true negative films (138 traditional films and 48 laser-printed ones) as control group. These were seeded into 4815 films of 2008 images to be audited in 2009. Thirty-four auditors interpreted all the films in a single-blind, randomized, pair-control study. The performance of 34 auditors was analyzed by chi-square test.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Over the past four decades, per capita alcohol consumption in Japan has increased 4-fold. Age-adjusted cirrhosis mortality rates for men have also increased, whereas the rates for women have declined gradually. This widening difference in mortality could be due to a decreasing prevalence of viral hepatitis infection for both sexes and to differences in alcohol consumption between the sexes. Difficulties in estimating the impact of increased alcohol consumption on mortality rates in Japan also arise from changes in the prevalence of non-alcohol-related risk factors. METHODS: To measure the relative contribution of alcohol to death from cirrhosis, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, and head and neck cancer among Japanese men, we used the mortality rate for Japanese women as the standard because alcohol consumption for women has been low. We used published vital statistics data from 1992 to 1996 to calculate the attributable risk percent (ARP) in 5-year cohorts of Japanese men age 20 and older. RESULTS: Among Japanese men, heavy alcohol consumption accounted for 70.7% of deaths due to cirrhosis, 76.8% of liver cancer deaths, 88.5% of esophageal cancer deaths, and 87.4% of head and neck cancer deaths. When we examined ARPs by age group, ARPs for these four diseases were approximately 80% in the middle age groups. However, for older groups, the ARPs for cirrhosis and liver cancer were much lower than those for esophageal cancer and head and neck cancer. The prevalence of previous hepatitis C virus infection, considered to be the major cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer, increased with age.",

Our aims were to prospectively evaluate the different intervals between two elective abdominal surgical interventions and to determine which factors were associated with a decrease in the inter-operative time delay. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between November 2001 and July 2002, 102 inter-operative periods were prospectively analyzed. All the interventions involved either an elective, planned laparotomy or a laparoscopic procedure, under general anesthesia. The interval between two operations was divided into three periods: the departure of the patient operated on; the empty theatre; the entry of the next patient. The collected data were compared to retrospective data from 90 days and 10 years prior to the study. RESULTS: The average time delay between two interventions was 63.5 min (40-107) vs. 72.3 min (30-91) 3 months earlier and 32 min (10-105) (P = 0.001) 10 years earlier. The average time from skin closure to the departure of the patient from the operating room was 15.7 min (5-35), of which 3.5 min (1-15) was surgically related, 7.7 min (1-26) was anesthetic time (waking the patient) and 4.5 min (2-15) for taking the patient out of theatre.

The HO-1 gene promoter region shows microsatellite polymorphism with different (GT)n repeats, reported to differently induce gene expression, with the short allele associated with higher gene expression. We measured the acute inflammatory response using coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) as a well-characterized and uniform stimulus and examined the correlation between levels of IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen and their relationship to HO-1 genotype. METHODS: Two hundred and seventy-five consecutive patients undergoing CABG were genotyped for the HO-1 promoter polymorphism using PCR and automated DNA capillary sequencer. IL-6, CRP and fibrinogen were measured at baseline and 6, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours after CABG. RESULTS: Complete IL-6, CRP and fibrinogen measures were available in 220 patients. Before surgery IL-6 levels showed a strong correlation with CRP and fibrinogen (r = 0.48, P<0.0001; r = 0.41, P<0.0001 respectively), with a significant correlation between CRP and fibrinogen (r = 0.61, P<0.0001).

This study was designed to determine hand hygiene compliance, before and after an educational intervention and its impact on hospital infection rates. METHOD: The study was done in neonatal intensive care unit of an educational hospital. All healthcare providers working in the unit at the time of study were trained on importance of hand hygiene and methods of hand hygiene observation; after that hand washing compliance controlled by a physician during postintervention phase. Hand hygiene compliance, healthcare associated infection and mortality rates compared before and after educational intervention. RESULTS: Compliance of health-care workers for all hand hygiene opportunities combined was 30% before intervention and improved to 70% in postintervention. In postintervention phase, healthcare associated infection rates and mortality rates decreased significantly as the hand hygiene compliance improved.",

        "input": "METHODS: In a 3-way randomized crossover study, 18 healthy postmenopausal women consumed two sodium-rich BMWs and a low-mineral water (LMW) with a standard fat-rich meal. Fasting and postprandial blood samples were taken at 30, 60 and 120 min. Serum glucose, insulin, cholesterol and triacylglycerols were determined. Insulin resistance was estimated by HOMA and insulin sensitivity was calculated by quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKY). RESULTS: Glucose levels did not change. HOMA and QUICKY values were highly inversely correlated (r = -1,000; p<0.0001). Insulin concentrations showed a significant time effect (p<0.0001) and a significant water x time interaction (p<0.021). At 120 min insulin levels with BMW-1 were significantly lower than with LMW (p = 0.022). Postprandial insulin concentrations showed significantly different patterns of mineral water intake depending on HOMA n-tiles (p = 0.016).",

        "input": "INTRODUCTION: Exsanguination from penetrating torso injury is a major source of mortality on the battlefield. Advanced Life Support guidelines suggest 'on-scene' thoracotomy for patients in cardiac arrest following penetrating chest trauma. This requires significant resourcing and training. Experience from published series (31 pre-hospital thoracotomies with 3 survivors) suggests that when this manoeuvre is applied to a well selected group it is a significant and life-saving procedure. Can this be applied to military injuries? METHODS: Over a 12 month period on Operation Herrick all patients who sustained significant thoracic trauma were retrospectively reviewed. Parameters were recorded to allow detailed analysis of injury pattern and operative management. Our main objective was to determine if an early (pre-hospital) thoracotomy would have influenced the outcome. RESULTS: Over the period, 81 patients required operative intervention following thoracic trauma: 8 patients underwent emergency thoracotomy (performed as part of the resuscitation) and 14 underwent urgent thoracotomy (performed after physiology partly restored). There were 9 fatalities--7 undergoing emergency thoracotomy and 2 post-operatively from multi-organ failure. Of the 7 intra-operative deaths 4/7 patients had thoracic injury and 6/7 had additional abdominal injuries. The median predicted survival of fatalities was 2.0% using Trauma Injury Severity Scoring. DISCUSSION: Emergency thoracotomy should be performed in cardiac arrest following penetrating trauma as soon as possible. Highest survival rates in both in-hospital and pre-hospital thoracotomy are found in isolated cardiac stab wounds (19.4%). Poorest survival is found in multiply, ballistic injured patients (0.7%). The latter best reflects the military environment.",

OBJECTIVE: To test whether the rigid application of a predefined standardized clinical assessment using the Duke criteria by the research team would provide improved diagnostic accuracy of endocarditis when compared with usual clinical care provided by the attending team. METHODS: Between April 1, 2000 and March 31, 2001, 101 consecutive inpatients with suspected endocarditis were examined prospectively and independently by both teams. The clinical likelihood of endocarditis was graded as low, moderate or high. All patients underwent transthoracic echocardiography and appropriate transesophageal echocardiography if deemed necessary. All diagnostic and therapeutic outcomes were evaluated prospectively. RESULTS: Of 101 consecutive inpatients (age 50+/-16 years; 62 males) enrolled, 22% subsequently were found to have endocarditis. The pre-echocardiographic likelihood categories as graded by the clinical and research teams were low in nine and 37 patients, respectively, moderate in 83 and 40 patients, respectively, and high in nine and 24 patients, respectively, with only a marginal agreement in classification (kappa=0.33).

Recent literature would suggest that after a routine, uncomplicated tracheotomy, chest radiography is a low-yield procedure that incurs unnecessary expense. Percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy (PDT) is rapidly replacing open tracheotomy as the intensive care unit procedure of choice for airway management. Complication rates are equivalent between the two procedures. OBJECTIVE: We examined the value and cost-effectiveness of routine postoperative chest radiographs in patients undergoing PDT. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: The study was a prospective analysis of 54 consecutive PDTs performed at a tertiary care academic institution. RESULTS: Eighteen (33%) patients had chest radiographs obtained within 1 hour of PDT (6 at the request of the otolaryngology service); 35 (66%) underwent radiography more than 2 hours later at the request of the intensive care unit for reasons other than PDT. There were no incidents of pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, or tracheotomy tube malposition in any patient.

The development of sentence lists for a wide age range of children and the advent of handheld digital recording devices have overcome two barriers to routine use of this tool. Yet, difficulties in recruiting adequate numbers of adults to judge speech samples continue to make routine assessment impractical. In response to this barrier, it has been proposed that children who are 9 years or older might be adequate substitutes for adult listener-judges (Ertmer, 2011). METHOD: To examine this possibility, 22 children from the 3rd, 4th, and 5th grades identified words from speech samples previously judged by adults. RESULTS: Children in the 3rd and 4th grades identified fewer words than adults, whereas scores for 5th graders were not significantly different from those of the adults.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 185 consecutive patients who underwent subclavian flap angioplasty between 1974 and 1998 was carried out. The patients included 125 neonates and 60 infants, with a median age of 18 days. Sixty-six (36%) patients had an additional ventricular septal defect, 41 (22%) patients had aortic arch hypoplasia diagnosed preoperatively, 141 (76%) had an associated patent ductus arteriosus, and 41 (22%) had additional complex heart disease. Follow-up was with transthoracic Doppler echocardiography in all patients. RESULTS: The early mortality was 3%. Recoarctation, defined as a Doppler gradient of 25 mm Hg or more, occurred in 11 (6%) patients at a median follow-up of 6.2 years (6.2 +/- 4.6 years). This included 4 of the 41 patients in whom arch hypoplasia was diagnosed preoperatively. There were no complications with the left arm. By multivariate analysis, risk factors for death were determined to be residual arch hypoplasia and low birth weight. The only risk factor for recoarctation was persistent arch hypoplasia after surgical treatment. However, angiographic imaging of the aorta showed that recoarctation was not due to a hypoplastic transverse arch, and it was probably at the site of ductal tissue. Survival at 5 and 10 years was 98% and 96%, respectively. Freedom from reoperation for recoarctation was 98% at 5 years and 96% at 10 years.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: For a total of four clinical application settings, two zoom formats, and all dose levels provided, the transmission dose was measured and representative images were recorded for each test device. The data was scored by four observers to assess low contrast and spatial resolution performance. The results were converted to a relative image quality figure allowing for a direct image quality and dose comparison of the two systems. RESULTS: For one test device, the Cios Alpha system achieved equivalent (within the inter-observer standard error) or better low contrast resolution scores at significantly lower dose levels, while the results of the other test device suggested that both systems achieved similar image quality at the same dose.

In previous ICD trials, shocks have been considered an appropriate surrogate for sudden cardiac death (SCD) because the number of shocks has been thought to be equivalent to the mortality excess in patients without ICDs. The practice of equating ICD shocks with mortality is controversial and has not been validated critically. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Defibrillators in Non-Ischemic Cardiomyopathy Treatment Evaluation (DEFINITE) trial was a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial of ICD therapy in 458 patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Patients were randomized to receive standard medical therapy (STD) or STD plus an ICD. Shock electrograms were reviewed, and the cause of death was evaluated by a separate blinded events committee. There were 15 SCD or cardiac arrests in the STD group and only 3 in the ICD arm. In contrast, of the 229 patients randomized to an ICD, 33 received 70 appropriate ICD shocks. Patients in the ICD arm were more likely to have an arrhythmic event (ICD shock plus SCD) than patients in the STD arm (hazard ratio 2.12, 95% CI 1.153 to 3.893, P=0.013).

Using multi-level hurdle models, the authors assessed whether the odds of being physically active and the mean hours of PA among active people (in 2009) were related to the levels of neighborhood traffic safety (in 2006) and changes in the levels of neighborhood traffic safety (between 2006 and 2009). Next, we examined if these associations varied according to gender, age, and employment status. RESULTS: Higher levels of neighborhood traffic safety were associated with higher odds of being active (OR 1.080 (1.025-1.139)). An increase in levels of neighborhood traffic safety was associated with increased odds of being active (OR 1.060 (1.006-1.119)). This association was stronger among women, people aged 35 to 59, and those who were gainfully employed. Neither levels of traffic safety nor changes in these levels were associated with the mean hours of PA among people who were physically active (OR 0.997 (0.975-1.020); OR 1.001 (0.978-1.025), respectively).",

RESULTS: Cobb angle corrected from 58 degrees to 34 degrees (41%), apical vertebral rotation from 26 degrees to 20 degrees (23%), apical vertebral translation from 4.5 to 2.4 cm (47%), and maximum angle of trunk inclination from 17 degrees to 13 degrees (22%) (preoperative to 2 years). Rib-hump reassertion occurred between 8 weeks and 1 year, regardless of age, and correlated with changes in vertebral translation (for 10 vertebral levels corresponding to 10 back surface levels between C7 and S1, P = 0.001 MANOVA). Preoperative frontal tilt of L1 with concave fifth rib-spinal angle predicted the percentage correction of maximum angle of trunk inclination, and the concave ninth rib-spinal angle predicted reassertion of maximum angle of trunk inclination.",

        "input": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether abdominal myomectomy could be a choice for patients with symptomatic fibroids above the age of 48 years, who wish to get hormonal replacement therapy and desire to retain their uterus. METHODS: We performed 504 abdominal myomectomies between 1990 and 2004. The mean age was 33+/-4.09 years, 9 (1.8%; 9/504) patients were above 48 years and 6 (1.19%; 6/504) of them requested hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) after the enucleation of fibroids. Data of these nine cases were compared to a matched control group of patients who had hysterectomy in the same year in 3 months to those who underwent abdominal myomectomy with same indications for surgery, same location, size and number of fibroids. The main aim of our study was to compare perioperative morbidity, duration of hospital stay between myomectomy and hysterectomy groups and determine the recurrence of fibroids and/or symptoms in 1 year with HRT in the myomectomy group. RESULTS: The perioperative morbidity did not differ between the compared groups. In the myomectomy group with 1-year HRT we did not observe the recurrence of fibroids and symptoms.",

The authors wondered if depressive symptoms in patients with obstructive sleep apnea would account for some of the fatigue beyond that explained by obstructive sleep apnea severity. METHOD: Sixty patients with obstructive sleep apnea-i.e., score>/=15 on the respiratory disturbance index (mean score=49; range=15-111)-underwent polysomnography and completed the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D Scale), Profile of Mood States (POMS), and Medical Outcomes Study surveys. Data were analyzed by using hierarchical regression, with POMS fatigue score as the dependent variable (step 1, forced entry of apnea severity variables; step 2, forced entry of CES-D Scale score). RESULTS: Whereas score on the respiratory disturbance index and the percent of time oxygen saturation was<90% together accounted for 4.2% of variance in scores on the POMS fatigue scale, the CES-D Scale score accounted for 10 times the variance (i.e., an additional 42.3%) in POMS fatigue scale score.",

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of preoperative coil embolization of lumbar and inferior mesenteric arteries on the incidence of type II endoleak after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. METHODS: The subjects were consecutive patients who underwent EVAR between January 1996 and January 2001. Patent aortic side branches were identified with preprocedural spiral computed tomographic scanning and calibrated angiography. Coil embolization was performed before EVAR. Patients were followed up with plain radiographs and ultrasound and dual phase spiral computed tomographic scans. Digital subtraction angiography was performed when endoleak was suspected. The outcome measures were the incidence of type II endoleaks and changes in maximum aortic sac diameter (Dmax). RESULTS: Forty patients underwent EVAR, with a median duration of follow-up of 24 months (range, 3 to 48 months). Before surgery, the inferior mesenteric artery was patent in 16 patients (45%) and the lumbar arteries in 21 patients (53%). Inferior mesenteric artery embolization was successful in 13 of 16 patients (81%). Lumbar embolization was attempted in 13 patients and was successful in eight (62%). During EVAR, successful sac exclusion was achieved in 38 patients (95%). None of the patients who underwent embolization before EVAR had type II endoleak develop, eight of 13 patients (62%) with patent lumbar arteries had endoleaks develop (P =.006), and three of these patients subsequently underwent successful coil embolization. Type II endoleak was associated with a 2.0-mm median increase in Dmax (P =.045). A 3.0-mm increase in Dmax was associated with a 100% likelihood of type II endoleak (P =.001).",

We report the continuous measurement of intramuscular pressure (IMP) during decompressive lumbar laminectomy and its relationship to subsequent back pain and disability. METHODS: Twenty patients undergoing two-level decompressive lumbar laminectomy for lumbar canal stenosis were recruited. Back pain and disability were assessed by use of the Visual Analog Score (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Short-Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey. During surgery, IMP was recorded continuously from the multifidus muscle by use of a pressure transducer. The intramuscular perfusion pressure (IPP) was estimated as the difference between the patient's mean arterial pressure and IMP. RESULTS: Two muscle retractors were used: the Norfolk and Norwich (n = 10) and the McCulloch (n = 10). The mean duration of deep muscle retraction was 62.7 +/- 8 minutes (range, 19-133 min). On application of deep muscle retraction, there was a rapid and sustained increase in IMP (P<0.001), and overall, the calculated mean IPP approached 0 mm Hg or less during this period (P<0.001). On release of deep muscle retraction, there was a rapid decrease in IMP to preoperative levels. The IPP was greater with the Norfolk and Norwich than the McCulloch retractor (P<0.001). Compared with preoperative values, there was a decrease in ODI (P<0.001) and VAS for back pain (P<0.001) at discharge and 4 to 6 weeks postoperatively. There was no significant difference in the SF-36 scores at discharge or 4 to 6 weeks postoperatively.",

Radiographs of the 367 patients were assessed by two independent reviewers. Four measurements of displacement of the fracture were recorded and the inter-observer correlation assessed using the intra-class correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Inter-observer correlation was high (>0.8) for three of the four measurements. Repeat measurements of a further randomly generated 10% sample (37) were made four weeks later to assess intra-observer agreement, which was again high (>0.8) for the same three parameters (radial height, radial inclination and dorsal/palmar tilt).

Given the higher acquisition cost of enoxaparin relative to unfractionated heparin, we assessed whether the reduced use of revascularization procedures and related care makes enoxaparin a cost-saving therapy in Canada. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed cumulative 1-year resource use data on the 1259 ESSENCE patients enrolled in Canadian centers (40% of the total ESSENCE sample). Patient-specific data on use of drugs, diagnostic cardiac catheterization, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass grafting, and hospital days were available from the initial hospital stay and cumulative to 1 year. Hospital resources were costed with the use of data from a teaching hospital in southern Ontario that is a participant in the Ontario Case Costing Project. During the initial hospital stay, use of enoxaparin was associated with reduced use of diagnostic catheterization and revascularization procedures, with the largest effect being reduced use of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (15.0% vs 10.6%; P =.03).

The few studies examining the relationship between stressful events and neuroimaging markers have been small and inconsistent. This study examined whether different types of stressful events and perceived stress could predict the development of brain lesions. METHOD: This was a secondary analysis of 121 patients with MS followed for 48 weeks during a randomized controlled trial comparing stress management therapy for MS (SMT-MS) to a waitlist control (WLC). Patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans every 8 weeks. Every month, patients completed an interview measure assessing stressful life events and self-report measures of perceived stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms, which were used to predict the presence of gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) and T2 lesions on MRI scans 29-62 days later. Participants classified stressful events as positive or negative. Negative events were considered 'major' if they involved physical threat or threat to the patient's family structure, and 'moderate' otherwise. RESULTS: Positive stressful events predicted decreased risk for subsequent Gd+ lesions in the control group [odds ratio (OR) 0.53 for each additional positive stressful event, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30-0.91] and less risk for new or enlarging T2 lesions regardless of group assignment (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55-0.99).

The ideal dose of cyclosporine that maximizes its immunosuppressive properties and minimizes its toxicity has remained an enigma since its introduction. This study was undertaken to evaluate which range of cyclosporine levels provided the most effective protection against graft rejection. METHODS: We studied the correlation between cyclosporine levels and histologic grade of rejection, cardiac function, and renal function by retrospectively analyzing the results of 1407 individual whole blood cyclosporine trough levels. One hundred seven heart transplant recipients were studied within 2 years of undergoing transplantation. As a historical comparison, we also studied 146 individual trough cyclosporine levels from a subgroup of patients (n = 14) who had acute cellular rejection with graft dysfunction or failure. We correlated trough cyclosporine levels with the histologic severity of cellular rejection, cardiac function (right cardiac catheterization), and serum creatinine in both groups. The correlation was performed within patient's own data rather than between patient groups to avoid interpatient variations. RESULTS: The mean cyclosporine level was significantly higher (206 ng/ml) when the patients had grade 0 cellular rejection in comparison to grade 3A, with a mean cyclosporine level of 173 ng/ml (p = 0.005). Patients with graft dysfunction or failure had higher mean cyclosporine level (230 ng/ml) when they had no rejection compared with 3A rejection with a mean cyclosporine level of 153 ng/ml (p = 0.001).

METHODS: Women who had induction of labour at 39 weeks of gestation with a neonatal birthweight of 4000 \u00b1 125 g (3875-4125 g) were compared with women who delivered (either induced or spontaneous labour) at 40, 41 or 42 weeks (i.e. expectant management), assuming an intrauterine fetal weight gain of 200 g per additional week of gestation. Similar comparisons were made at 40 and 41 weeks of gestation. Chi-square test and multivariable logistic regression analysis were used for statistical comparison. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Method of delivery, 5-minute Apgar scores, neonatal injury. RESULTS: There were 132,112 women meeting the study criteria. In women whose labours were induced at 39 weeks and who delivered a neonate with a birthweight of 4000 \u00b1 125 g, the frequency of caesarean was lower compared with women who delivered at a later gestational age (35.2% versus 40.9%; adjusted OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.17-1.33).

METHODS: We evaluated the epidemiology of serosorting among men who have sex with men (MSM) seen in a sexually transmitted disease clinic, Seattle, WA, 2001-2007, and defined the percentage of visits during which MSM tested HIV positive based on whether they reported nonconcordant unprotected anal intercourse (UAI), UAI only with partners thought to be HIV negative (serosorters), no UAI, or no anal intercourse. RESULTS: Men reported serosorting during 3295 (26%) of 12,449 visits. From 2001 to 2007, the proportion of visits during which men reported serosorting increased (P = 0.02); this change was greater among HIV-infected MSM than among HIV-uninfected MSM. Among men who tested HIV negative in the preceding year, HIV tests were positive in 49 (3.5%) of 1386 who reported nonconcordant UAI, 40 (2.6%) of 1526 serosorters, 28 (1.5%) of 1827 who had only protected anal intercourse, and 0 of 410 who had no anal intercourse (P<0.0001); 32% of new HIV infections occurred in serosorters.

We aimed to assess the discriminatory value of the \"central vein sign\" (CVS). METHODS: In a 3-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study, 28 WMLs in 14 patients with at least one circumscribed lesion>5\u2009mm and not more than eight non-confluent lesions>3\u2009mm were prospectively included. Only WMLs in FLAIR images with a maximum diameter of>5\u2009mm were correlated to their SWI equivalent for CVS evaluation. RESULTS: Five patients fulfilled the revised McDonald criteria for MS and nine patients were given alternative diagnoses. Nineteen MS-WMLs and nine non-MS-WMLs>5\u2009mm were detected. Consensus reading found a central vein in 16 out of 19 MS-WMLs (84 %) and in one out of nine non-MS-WMLs (11 %), respectively. The CVS proved to be a highly significant discriminator (P\u2009<\u20090.001) between MS-WMLs and non-MS-WMLs with a sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value and accuracy of 84 %, 89 %, 94 %, 73 % and 86 %, respectively.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Gastric schwannomas are not common but are clinically important in terms of differential diagnosis from other submucosal lesions. The precise preoperative diagnosis, however, has been challenging mainly owing to the lack of specific findings in conventional imaging studies. The aim of this study was to revisit the possibilities and limitations of modern preoperative diagnostic modalities for gastric schwannomas. METHODS: Fourteen consecutive patients with a final pathological diagnosis of gastric schwannoma were retrospectively analyzed. Data included demographics, preoperative imaging studies/diagnosis, surgery, histopathology, and follow-up results. RESULTS: The series included 6 males and 8 females, with a median age of 49 years (range 26-68 years). No symptoms were presented, except for 1 patient with epigastric pain. The tumors were located in the upper (n = 5), middle (3), and lower stomach (6), with a median size of 41 mm (range 20-75 mm). Twelve schwannomas (86%) showed homogeneous enhancement on computed tomography. Ulceration was seen on endoscopy in 4 of 12 available cases (33%). Positron emission tomography was performed in the last 4 patients, showing fluorodeoxy-glucose uptake in all cases (100%). A preoperative diagnosis of schwannoma was not obtained in the majority of cases (13/14, 93%); only 1 case was correctly diagnosed, by endoscopic aspiration cytology. Laparoscopic partial gastrectomy was attempted and completed in 13 cases. The patients have been followed up for 4.7 years (range 2.1-20.3 years), with no recurrencesor metastases and acceptable gastrointestinal function.",

A modification, termed the Congruent-Arc, is thought to improve glenoid reconstruction through better articular congruency and greater bone reconstitution. The strengths of these techniques, however, have not been reported.  Purpose/ HYPOTHESIS: To compare the fixation stability, strength, glenoid vault load transfer, and joint contact between the Classic and Congruent-Arc techniques. The authors hypothesized that the Classic Latarjet would exhibit inferior joint contact characteristics while having greater stability and strength and more normal glenoid vault strain. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: Sixteen shoulder specimens (8 pairs) were tested by loading the glenohumeral joint with the glenoid intact, following creation of a 25% anterior bone defect, and after random assignment to the Classic or Congruent-Arc Latarjet techniques. Specimens were mounted to a testing apparatus that allowed concentric, centralized loading and loading 30\u00b0 anterior on the glenoid rim. Cyclic loading (100 cycles at 1 Hz) was applied with a staircase protocol (50, 100, 150, and 200 N). Graft interface displacement and glenoid load transfer, quantified in terms of strain, were recorded during loading. Contact was quantified during 50-N loading using a thin pressure sensor. After cyclic loading, specimens were loaded to failure, defined as 5 mm of graft interface displacement. RESULTS: The 30\u00b0 loading \u2265100 N resulted in significantly greater graft displacement (P<.004) in the Congruent-Arc group as compared with the Classic (mean displacement range, 0.9-2.6 vs 0.1-1.2 mm). The Congruent-Arc group also had significantly greater glenoid vault strain (P<.001) and glenoid load transfer (P<.001) than the Classic group.

However, there are still limited data on the role of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in treatment of this disease. The aim of this study is to identify the advantages and disadvantages of minimally invasive surgery and compare the outcomes with patients undergoing thoracotomy in this parasitic disease. METHODS: The medical records of 77 patients (53 male, 24 female) undergoing surgery for pulmonary hydatid cyst disease between January 2011 and January 2014 were reviewed. Removal of the hydatid cyst was completed using video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in 39% (n = 30) of the patients, whereas open thoracotomy was used in 61% (n = 47). Conversion rate was 21%. Statistical analysis was used to assess differences in drainage amount, time to drain removal, length of surgery, length of hospital stay, and pain scores. Probability values of less than 0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: The drainage amount, time to drain removal, length of surgery, duration of narcotic analgesics usage, and visual analog scale scores in the thoracotomy group were significantly longer than those of the thoracoscopy group.

Although surgical resection is considered a treatment option for patients with localized metastases confined to the liver, the longterm survival benefit of liver resection has not been clearly demonstrated. We examined the survival of patients undergoing liver resection for this disease. STUDY DESIGN: Between 1984 and 1995, we evaluated 38 patients with liver-only metastases from neuroendocrine tumors, including 21 carcinoid, 13 islet cell, and 4 atypical neuroendocrine neoplasms. Data from a combined prospective and retrospective database and a tumor registry were analyzed. Of these patients, 15 underwent complete resection of all known disease. The remaining 23 patients, who also had disease confined to the liver, had comparable tumor burden but were believed to be unresectable. The longterm survival rates of these two groups were compared. RESULTS: Patients who underwent liver resection did not differ from those who were unresectable with regard to age, pathology, primary tumor site, serum alkaline phosphatase levels, or percentage of the liver involved. All resections were complete, leaving no residual disease, and consisted of lobectomy (n = 3), segmentectomy (n = 1), and wedge resections (n = 11). There were no operative deaths. Patients who underwent hepatic resection had a significantly longer survival than unresected patients. Although median survival had not been reached in resected patients, the median survival in the unresectable group was 27 months. Patients who underwent liver resection had a higher 5-year actuarial survival (73% versus 29%).",

BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown that a significant proportion of patients treated with IFN-beta develop NAbs that hamper or abolish the therapeutic effect of IFN-beta. However, some patients, who become NAb-positive under treatment with IFN-beta-1b, may revert to a NAb-negative state under continuous treatment. METHODS: We identified 40 patients from the Danish IFN protocol, who fulfilled the criteria: NAb-positive status for at least 12 months followed by reversion to NAb-negative state for at least 12 months. For comparison, we included 64 matching cases that had remained NAb-negative during an observation time of at least 36 months. The two groups were clinically and demographically alike. We measured NAb-neutralizing capacity using a clinically validated cytopathic effect assay. A blood sample with a neutralizing capacity of 20% or more was considered as NAb-positive. A patient was defined as NAb-positive after two consecutive blood tests separated by at least 6 months. Reversion to a NAb-negative state required at least two consecutive negative tests. To allow for the confounding effect of time we employed a mixed Poisson model. RESULTS: Patients who had been NAb-positive and reverted to a NAb-negative state regained treatment effect with the relapse rate as before the NAb-positive period adjusting for the effect of time, and the relapse rate was the same as in the permanently NAb-negative patients in corresponding time periods.",

AIMS: To compare the total body fat mass between preterm infants assessed at term corrected age and full-term newborns, and to investigate the effects of gestational age, gender, weight increase, being breast fed on total adiposity. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SUBJECTS: One hundred and ten preterm infants [mean (SD) gestational age: 29.9 (2.3) weeks; birth weight: 1118 (274) g], and 87 full term [mean (SD) 38.6 (1.21) weeks, 3203 (385) g], breastfed infants. OUTCOME MEASURES: Growth and body composition by means of a pediatric air displacement system were assessed at term corrected age in preterm infants and on day 3 of life in full term infants. RESULTS: Weight, length and head circumference were smaller in the preterm group as compared to the term group. Mean (SD) percentage of fat mass in preterm infants was significantly higher as compared to term infants [14.8 (4.4) vs 8.59 (3.71), P<0.0001]. Fat mass was negatively correlated with gestational age (P<0.001), and positively associated with weight increase (P<0.05).",

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate if acupuncture has a measurable effect on the resting electron EEG. SUBJECTS: 14 healthy volunteers with no neurological condition took part in the study. METHODS: Using a digital storage EEG recorder and quantitative frequency analysis techniques data were obtained before, during and after acupuncture stimulation. To minimize the effect of artefacts all data were collected with the subject alert, but with eyes closed. Manual stimulation of the LI 4 acupuncture site was undertaken for periods of 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 min. Frequency analysis of the EEG data from each acupuncture event was compared to the baseline data to show any significant changes over the bandwidth 0.3 to 30 Hz. Only changes greater than 2 standard deviations were considered significant. RESULTS: In 10 subjects the frequency spectra remained unchanged during acupuncture, but in three significant increases were recorded in the amplitude of very low frequencies between 0.5 and 2 Hz and in one subject there was an increase in the amplitude of the alpha band during acupuncture. All spectra returned to their baseline values immediately after acupuncture. OUTCOME: The changes recorded in the delta band of individuals during acupuncture were large but highly variable. They arose at a frequency that is on the limit of the recording equipment and where recording and physiological artefacts are known to occur, although there was no evidence of artefactual contamination of the data. The one case in which there was an increase in the alpha band is attributed to suppression of the dominant rhythm initially brought about by anxiety concerning the procedure which subsequently disappeared during acupuncture as the subject relaxed.",

METHODS: Biopsy samples were examined from cases with established diagnoses of bullous pemphigoid (n = 12), dermatitis herpetiformis (n = 6), and pemphigus vulgaris (n = 6) and exposed to formalin for time points ranging from 2 minutes to 4 hours. RESULTS: We found that immunoreactants were detectable in the majority of samples when subjected to 2 minutes of formalin exposure. Dermatitis herpetiformis and pemphigoid samples retained immunogenicity for 10 minutes, whereas pemphigus showed reduced immunogenicity for all samples studied. A nonimmunologic nuclear fluorochroming pattern was noted in some of the specimens after formalin immersion. LIMITATIONS: Sample size, only examining 3 disease processes, and samples already having been in Michel medium were the major limitations in the study.",

        "input": "PURPOSE: Cortical tubers are epileptogenic lesions in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Giant cells and dysplastic neurons are pathological hallmarks of cortical tubers. Severe astrogliosis, which is invariably present in tubers, has attracted much less attention. We hypothesize that the development of astrogliosis in cortical tubers constitutes a primary pathology of astrocytes and is directly related to TSC 1/2 mutations. METHODS: To begin to test this hypothesis, we performed immunohistochemical and electron microscopic analysis of brain tuber tissue resected from epileptic TSC patients. We compared alterations in tuber astrocytes to those found in other acute and chronic human epilepsy pathologies. RESULTS: We found that astrogliosis in tubers is comprised of a mixture of \"gliotic\" and \"reactive\" astrocytes. The majority of tuber astrocytes are \"gliotic\" astrocytes that are morphologically and immunophenotypically similar to astrocytes in areas of gliosis in hippocampal sclerosis (HS). However, specific immunostaining features differentiate TSC gliosis from HS gliosis. \"Reactive\" tuber astrocytes are large-sized, vimentin positive cells in the vicinity of giant cells that show activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, consistent with mutated TSC gene function. These cells resemble acutely reactive human astrocytes seen in tissue resected from depth electrode implantation patients. Oligodendrocytes and NG2 expressing glial cells do not have any detectable alterations within tubers.",

Patient encounters are important for developing clinical thinking, communication skills, and professional attitude. We investigated whether the amount of clinical experience during clerkship correlated with students' clinical competency and students' perception of effectiveness of their clerkship on it. METHODS: Fourth year medical students undertook the Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCE) in August 2012. Students provided the number of patients for whom they took medical histories or performed physical examinations during clerkship and provided feedback as to whether or not the clinical clerkship was helpful in preparing OSCE. The correlation between the OSCE score and number of patients was analyzed. RESULTS: One hundred thirty students completed the questionnaire (86.6%). OSCE scores correlated with the total number of patients encountered for physical examinations (correlation coefficient, 0.274; p\u2009=\u20090.0105). Cumulative 3-year GPAs were positively correlated with OSCE scores (correlation coefficient, 0.330; p\u2009=\u20090.0001). Most (92.3%) answered that their clinical clerkship was helpful in preparing them for the OSCE; however, only 20% felt that their clinical clerkship was most helpful.

The aim of the study was to analyze the role of the cellular components of the nasal cytology as a tool for prediction of atopic diseases and clinical symptoms preceding allergic march. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a retrospective manner out of a group of 1620 children, 146 symptomatic children (60 girls and 86 boys) meeting inclusion criteria (age below 4 years at first visit, symptoms suggesting allergy, nasal cytology performed at the beginning of observation, observation of at least 4 years) were included in analysis. RESULTS: Mean age of children at time of enrollment was 27 months (SD 10 months). After 4 years allergic rhinitis (AR) was diagnosed in 85 children (58.2%), atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome (AEDS) in 51 (34.9%) and asthma in 48 (32.9%). Nonallergic etiology was identified in 36 patients (22.5%). All patients with asthma suffered from AR. Significant differences between groups were found in number of eosinophils (p<0.001), neutrophils (p<0.001), and lymphocytes (p = 0.028) in cytological examination of nasal mucosa. In children with AR (alone or combined with other comorbidities) nasal eosinophilia was higher than in children with AEDS (18% v. 3%; p = 0.004) or non-allergic disease (18% v. 4%; p<0.001).

However, various kinds of self-management educational materials which government or healthcare institutions provide for patients may not achieve the expected outcome. One of the critical reasons affecting patients' use intention could be patients' perceived information overload regarding the self-management educational materials. PURPOSE: This study proposed an extended model of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), which incorporated perceived information overload, to explore if information overload will prevent chronic patients from reading educational materials for self-care management. The independent variables are attitude, subject norm, perceived behavior control and perceived information overload while the dependent variable is behavior intention to use the self-management educational materials. Perceived information overload is also referred to as an antecedent variable which may has impacts on attitude and perceived behavior control. METHODS: The cross-sectional study interviewed newly diagnosed chronic patients with coronary artery disease, who are the potential users of the self-management educational materials, in a medical center in Taiwan. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics of the basic information distribution of the respondents, and structural equation modeling to study the reliability and validity for testing hypotheses. RESULTS: A total of 110 respondents were enrolled in this study and successful interview data were collected from 106 respondents. The result indicates that the patients' perceived information overload of self-management educational materials was validated to have impacts on attitude and perceived behavioral control constructs of the TPB as well as contributing a direct impact on patients' intentions to use self-management educational materials. Besides, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control constructs were validated to have significant impacts on behavioral intentions, whereas the attitude construct was not. Finally, the relationships between information overload and attitude, information overload and intention, subjective norm and intention, as well as perceived behavioral control and intention varied significantly between highly- and less-educated respondents.",
        "output": "The results of this study provide evidence that perceived information overload is an important factor that affects patients' intention to use self-management educational materials.

However, it is possible that these parameters may show different changes because of the different measurement systems. The present study aimed to compare changes in cHb and nTHI in working muscles, which were selected for measurement because the parameters changed dynamically.

Serum total testosterone levels were measured by ELISA at baseline and studied in relation to mortality and cardiovascular risk profile. RESULTS: Mean testosterone level was 8.69 \u00b1 4.10 (0.17 to 27.40) nmol/L. A large proportion of patients (66%) had testosterone deficiency (<10 nmol/L). In univariate analysis, serum testosterone levels were positively correlated with creatinine and inversely correlated with age, body mass index, and lipid parameters. During an average follow-up of 32 months, 104 (24.8%) patients died.

METHODS: We used data from an observational cross-sectional study with a sample of 3,415 German schoolchildren aged 10-17 years. Cigarette advertising exposure was assessed with an image of a Marlboro ad, asking for contact frequency (number of times seen the ad) and brand name. Liking of the ad was measured with two items (alpha = 0.78). RESULTS: We found a positive linear association between exposure to the Marlboro ad and liking it. This association remained significant (standardized \u03b2 = 0.09; p<0.001) even after statistical control for smoking status, smoking of friends and parents, attitudes towards smoking in general, cigarette advertising receptivity (having a favorite cigarette ad), exposure to other advertisings, age, sex, socioeconomic status, rebelliousness and sensation seeking, self-reported school performance, and study region.",

The authors were interested in the extent of formal training in delivering bad news in hematology/oncology fellowships in the United States. METHODS: An e-mail survey was sent to all hematology/oncology fellowship program directors in the United States. Surveys were e-mailed to 124 program directors and responses were received either via e-mail or regular mail. Program directors were asked the adequacy, the perceived necessity, the quality of this training, and the institutional support provided. It was also intended to elicit responses about the degree of formal training fellows receive in delivering bad news. chi(2) Statistics were used to perform comparisons between items; p values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Sixty-five surveys were completed and returned (52% response rate). The majority of programs, 82%, are in urban areas and 97% of the primary teaching hospitals are considered tertiary care centers and 46% of programs carry a National Cancer Institute (NCI) designation.

        "input": "PURPOSE: Oxaliplatin-associated neuropathy remains a dose-limiting toxicity of the standard chemotherapy regimen of oxaliplatin and capecitabine for metastatic colorectal cancer. No preventive strategy has definitively been established. Because this neuropathy is triggered by cold, we hypothesized that infusing oxaliplatin at 37 degrees C might reduce neuropathy. METHODS: In this open-label pilot feasibility trial, patients with no prior chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer were included. Treatment consisted of capecitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) bid on days 1-14 and oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 on day 1 of a 21-day cycle. The oxaliplatin infusion was administered through a fluid-warming device at a constant temperature of 37 degrees C over 2 h. The primary endpoint was feasibility and drug reactions during the infusion. Secondary endpoints included acute and chronic neuropathy as well as response rate. RESULTS: Twenty patients were enrolled, and a total of 95 cycles administered. Median cumulative oxaliplatin dose was 735 mg/m(2). Apart from one patient with laryngeal spasm, no other infusion-related adverse events were observed. Of the patients, 35% reported grade 3/4 acute dysesthesia or paresthesia according to a patients questionnaire. Chronic neuropathy according to NCI CTC v3.0 was observed in 85% (grade 1) and 15% (grade 2), respectively. The overall response rate was 45% (95% CI 23-67).",

Cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical connectivity and plasticity play a key role in consciousness. UWS patients do not usually show any \"cortical\" behavioral sign in response to painful stimulation. Nevertheless a \"focal conscious\" pain perception has been hypothesized. HYPOTHESIS: Since defective plasticity and connectivity within pain matrix could be striking mechanisms of non-conscious pain perception and, consequently, of non-cortical responses in UWS subjects, aim of our study was to investigate pain-motor plasticity in such patients through a specific paired laser associative stimulation protocol (L-PAS). METHODS: We enrolled 10 post-anoxic subjects and 10 healthy controls evaluating clinical and electrophysiological parameters before and after the application of such protocol. RESULTS: Some patient showed a restored pain-motor integration with a partial motor cortex excitability modification.",

METHOD: In autumn 2010, the authors conducted a cross-sectional, national survey of basic biomedical researchers funded by Canada's national health research agency and a representative sample of Canadian citizens to assess preferences for research outcomes across five attributes using a discrete choice experiment. Attributes included advancing scientific knowledge (assessed by published papers); building research capacity (assessed by trainees); informing decisions in the health products industry (assessed by patents); targeting economic, health, or scientific priorities; and cost. The authors reduced a fractional factorial design (18 pairwise choices plus an opt-out option) to three blocks of six. They also computed part worth utilities, differences in predicted probabilities, and willingness-to-pay values using nested logit models. RESULTS: Of 3,260 potential researchers, 1,749 (53.65% response rate) completed the questionnaire, along with 1,002 citizens.

We sought to describe the proportion of women who initially incorrectly contract the PFM and how many can learn after basic instruction. METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled 779 women presenting to community-based primary care practices. During PFM assessment, research nurses recorded whether women could correctly contract their PFM after a brief verbal cue. We defined pelvic organ prolapse (POP) as prolapse to or beyond the hymen and stress urinary incontinence (SUI) as a score of greater than equal 3 on the Incontinence Severity Index. RESULTS: Pelvic floor muscle contraction was done correctly on first attempt in 85.5%, 83.4%, 68.6%, and 85.8% of women with POP, SUI, both POP and SUI, and neither POP nor SUI, respectively (P=0.01 for difference between POP and SUI versus neither POP nor SUI). Of 120 women who initially incorrectly contracted the PFM, 94 women (78%) learned after brief instruction. Women with POP were less likely to learn than women with neither POP nor SUI (54.3% vs 85.7%, P=0.001).

METHODS: Patient inclusion criteria were: age over 10 years, therapeutically-induced neutropenia and fever for at least three hours above 38.5 degrees C in absence of a clear non-infectious aetiology. Patients were randomized into three groups: group C, ceftazidime alone 3 g/day; group CA, ceftazidime 3 g/day plus amikacin 15 mg/kg/day; or group C, ceftazidime 3 g/day plus vancomycin 1.5 g/day. RESULTS: Results from one hundred and two episodes of fever were analyzed. The underlying diseases were haematological malignancies (89 patients) and solid tumours (13 patients). The median duration of neutropenia (<0.5 x 10(9) PMN/L) was 18 days and the minimum duration of 7 days. The main criterion for the analysis of efficacy was the onset of a major infectious event, i.e. death related to documented or suspected infection and any infectious event considered life-threatening or hindering future treatment of the underlying disease. Eight (22%) patients in group C developed major infectious events compared with four (13%) in group CA and none in group CV (p<0.01). Major infectious events were mainly due to Gram-positive organisms, particularly Streptococcus species.",

In view of the major advances forged by chemotherapy in the treatment of the primary tumor, an attempt was made to destroy the tumor exclusively with this therapeutic modality and abrogate surgery. METHODS: Thirty-one consecutive patients were treated. All had localized disease (absence of metastases) at the time of diagnosis. Initial treatment with chemotherapy was comprised of high-dose methotrexate and leucovorin rescue (MTX-LF) in 3 patients and intraarterial cisplatin in 28 patients. Clinical, radiologic, angiographic, radionuclide, and histologic investigations were utilized to assess the efficacy of treatment. After a response at 3 months, entry into the study was permitted and treatment was maintained for a total of 18-21 months with a combination of agents comprised of MTX-LF, intraarterial cisplatin, and doxorubicin. Patients were monitored closely for disease recurrence with the investigations outlined earlier. Two informed consents were required: one at the time of diagnosis and another at 3 months after the initial response had been attained. RESULTS: Only 3 of 31 patients were cured with the administration of chemotherapy alone. Local recurrence and pulmonary metastases were not reported to develop in these 3 patients during a follow-up period of 204+ to 225+ months.

Conversely, desensitization of sst on tumor tissue (tachyphylaxis) may occur occasionally in patients on chronic octreotide therapy. Assuming that chronic exposure to octreotide induces tachyphylaxis, we hypothesized that chronic exposure of sst subtype 2 (sst2)-expressing cells to octreotide would downregulate binding of 111In-pentetreotide to sst and that this downregulation would be due to a reduction in the gene copy number for sst2. METHODS: The clinical scenarios of acute (24 h) and chronic (2 wk) octreotide use, followed by either nuclear imaging exposure (8.6 pmol/L) or therapeutic exposure (510 pmol/L) to (111)In-pentetreotide, were modeled in vitro. Receptor binding in IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cells (high sst2 expression) and PANC-1 human pancreatic cancer cells (no detectable sst2 expression) was evaluated. Gene copy numbers for sst subtypes 1-5 in IMR-32 cells were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The investigative agents AZD2927 and A7071 concentration-dependently blocked IKACh in vitro with minimal off-target activity. In anaesthetized dogs (n = 17) subjected to 8 weeks of rapid atrial pacing (RAP), the left atrial effective refractory period (LAERP) was maximally increased by 50 \u00b1 7.4 and 50 \u00b1 4.8 ms following infusion of AZD2927 and A7071. Ventricular refractoriness and the QT interval were unaltered. During sustained AF, both drugs significantly reduced AF frequency and effectively restored sinus rhythm. AZD2927 successfully restored sinus rhythm at 10/10 conversion attempts and A7071 at 14/14 attempts, whereas saline converted 4/17 episodes only (P<0.001 vs. AZD2927 and A7071). In atrial flutter patients (n = 18) undergoing an invasive investigation, AZD2927 did not change LAERP, the paced QT interval, or ventricular refractoriness when compared with placebo. To address the discrepancy on LAERP by IKACh blockade in man and dog and the hypothesis that atrial electrical remodelling is a prerequisite for IKACh blockade being efficient, six dogs were studied after 8 weeks of RAP followed by sinus rhythm for 4 weeks to reverse electrical remodelling.

Because of the antimicrobial compounds (mainly thymol and carvacrol) found in the essential oil, we believe that the endophytic microorganisms found in L. sidoides are selected to live in different parts of the plant. RESULTS: In this study, the endophytic microbial communities from the stems and leaves of four L. sidoides genotypes were determined using cultivation-dependent and cultivation-independent approaches. In total, 145 endophytic bacterial strains were isolated and further grouped using either ERIC-PCR or BOX-PCR, resulting in 76 groups composed of different genera predominantly belonging to the Gammaproteobacteria. The endophytic microbial diversity was also analyzed by PCR-DGGE using 16S rRNA-based universal and group-specific primers for total bacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria and 18S rRNA-based primers for fungi. PCR-DGGE profile analysis and principal component analysis showed that the total bacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and fungi were influenced not only by the location within the plant (leaf vs. stem) but also by the presence of the main components of the L. sidoides essential oil (thymol and/or carvacrol) in the leaves.

Smokers entailed 33.3% of the patients, and 45.5% of all patients presented with a work-related injury. An independent blinded observer reviewed at last follow-up lateral neutral and flexion/extension plain radiographs for radiographic fusion and instrumentation integrity. Clinical outcome was assessed on last follow-up and rated according to the Odom criteria. The threshold for statistical significance was established at P<0.05. RESULTS: Solid fusion was achieved in 63 patients (95.5%). Fusion was noted in 100% of the allograft patients, whereas 90% of the autograft patients achieved fusion. The difference in fusion rate between allograft and autograft was statistically significant (P = 0.001). The risk factors for fusion failure were smoking (P = 0.001) and work-related injury (P = 0.001). The clinical outcome was excellent in both groups.",

METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with stage IIIA (N2) non-small cell lung cancer underwent resection with radical intent after induction chemoradiotherapy in the period 2003 to 2006. Pulmonary function has been evaluated by spirometry, diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, and blood gas analysis before induction chemoradiotherapy (T0), 4 weeks after induction chemoradiotherapy and before surgery (T1), and 1 (T2), 3 (T3), 6 (T4), and 12 months (T5) after surgery. RESULTS: A 22.80% decrease of diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (P<.001) was observed at T1. At T2 significant decreases in the following were present: vital capacity, -20.50% (P<.001); forced vital capacity, -22.50% (P<.001); forced expiratory volume in 1 second, -23.00% (P<.001); peak expiratory flow, -29.0 (P<.001); forced expiratory flow 25% to 75%, -13.7% (P = .005); and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, 43.6% (P<.001). However, in the interval between T2 and T5, a progressive improvement of lung function in most parameters was observed, but only diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide presented a significant increase (P<.001). Within the same time gap (T2 to T5), subjects 65 years of age or younger showed an increasing trend for vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, whereas subjects 65 years of age or older showed a decreasing trend.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the most frequently used revascularization approach, often repeatedly applied. The quest for the ultimate revascularization procedure however may capture cardiologist's attention and lead them to minimize the issue of secondary prevention in their patients. Aims of this study were to assess: 1. The individual risk factor profile, 2. The relation between the risk factors correction and the number of hospital admissions for elective procedures, 3. The appropriateness of medical treatment in patients admitted for elective coronary invasive procedures (diagnostic and interventional). 4. The patients knowledge of threshold values for cardiovascular risk factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 100 patients (71% males, mean age 68 years) consecutively admitted for elective coronary angiography or PCI. They underwent a classical risk factors assessment and were divided in three groups according to the number of admissions for coronary angiography and in two groups according to the number of PCIs. RESULTS: Fifty-seven% of patients had been previously admitted for invasive examination at least three times and 58% had already been treated with at least one PCI. Seventy-one% were treated with beta-blockers but only 25% of them received a dosage found effective in RCTs (randomized clinical trials). Sixty% were treated with ACE-inhibitors and 83% received the dosage found effective in RCTs. Fifty-two% were treated with statins and 95% received a dosage found effective in RCTs. Nine% were still active smokers. Fourty-nine% had a LDL cholesterol level above 100 mg/dL. The percentage of patients not on target was unrelated to the number of hospital admissions for invasive procedures.",

STUDY DESIGN: The study included women with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who enrolled in our diabetes-in-pregnancy trial with a pregnancy that continued beyond 20 weeks' gestation and who were delivered between 1978 and December 31, 1991, to allow for a minimum of 3 years' follow-up. Pregnancy and follow-up information was obtained from the medical records and from our computerized database. For patients followed up elsewhere, information was obtained from their current physicians. Life-table analysis was used to determine (1) the risk for nephropathy developing de novo as a function of duration of disease and the association of this risk with parity and (2) the risk of renal failure developing in women with preexisting nephropathy and its association with parity. RESULTS: The study population included 182 pregnant women with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus: 46 with overt nephropathy (group F) and 136 without nephropathy (group NF). Pregnancy and increasing parity did not increase the overall risk for nephropathy (44% after 27 years of diabetes). In group NF 10% had nephropathy within 10.1 +/- 4.2 years of the pregnancy. Proteinuria appearing during pregnancy and glycemic control during pregnancy were significantly associated with the subsequent development of nephropathy.

OBJECTIVES: Posterolateral annular lesions were experimentally induced and allowed to mature for 12 weeks in the intervertebral discs of sheep. IDET was performed in an attempt to denervate and repair the annular lesion. The histologic and immunohistochemical effects of IDET were studied. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: IDET continues to be used as a minimally invasive treatment for chronic discogenic low back pain, with success rates reported in up to 70% of cases. The mechanism of action by which IDET exerts its effect is poorly understood. Proposed mechanisms include the contraction of collagen and the coagulation of annular nociceptors. An ovine model was used firstly to induce a posterolateral annular lesion, secondly to assess the innervation of such a lesion, and thirdly to assess the effect of IDET on this innervation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Posterolateral annular incisions were made in 40 lumbar discs of 20 sheep. Twelve weeks were allowed for each annular lesion to mature. IDET was then performed in the disc with the posterolateral annular tear and in another control level. IDET was performed using a modified intradiscal catheter (Spine-CATH; Oratec Interventions, Menlo Park, CA). Temperatures were recorded in the nucleus (TN) and the posterior annulus (TPA). The spines were harvested at predetermined intervals up to 18 months. Histologic sections of the discs were graded for disc morphology to assess degeneration and immunohistochemical staining was used to assess the innervation of the annulus. RESULTS: The mean temperature in the TPA was 42.2\u00b0C and in the TN was 37.2\u00b0C. The mean temperature in the annulus was 37.8\u00b0C. The mean temperature in the annulus was significantly higher than in the TPA (P < 0.001). The mean temperature in the annulus was significantly higher than in the TN (P < 0.001).

METHODS: A representative sample of the German population (N=2201) completed a questionnaire that included, in addition to the criterion (number of physician visits in the past 12 months), items aimed at identifying the target group and questions about physical symptoms, illness behavior, living situation, personality features, and sociodemographic status (a total of 31 predictors). RESULTS: Individuals with functional gastrointestinal disorders who consulted a physician for their gastrointestinal disorders and those who did not differed significantly, especially on psychological measures. The differences between these individuals and the general population were greater for the consulters than for the nonconsulters. Multiple regression analyses yielded nine predictors that explained 40.2% of the variance of the criterion. The best predictors of frequency of physician consultations were the duration of periods with symptoms and psychological factors, such as the severity of depression and the patients' views on the cause of their illness.",

        "input": "RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Interventions aimed at improving chronic care typically consist of multiple interconnected parts, all of which are essential to the effect of the intervention. Limited attention has been paid to the use of routine clinical and administrative data in the evolution of these complex interventions. The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of routinely collected data when evaluating complex interventions and to demonstrate how a theory-based, realist approach to evaluation may increase the feasibility of routine data. METHODS: We present a case study of evaluating a complex intervention, namely, the chronic care model (CCM), in Finnish primary health care. Issues typically faced when evaluating the effects of a complex intervention on health outcomes and resource use are identified by using routine data in a natural setting, and we apply context-mechanism-outcome (CMO) approach from the realist evaluation paradigm to improve the feasibility of using routine data in evaluating complex interventions. RESULTS: From an experimentalist approach that dominates the medical literature, routine data collected from a single centre offered a poor starting point for evaluating complex interventions. However, the CMO approach offered tools for identifying indicators needed to evaluate complex interventions.",

Therefore, the question of the effect of a new program on operating room times (ORT) is important. Our primary aim was to compare ORT of 3 common procedures done by attendings alone vs ORT of cases with residents. METHODS: We queried records of 1458 patients from the JFK Medical Center database for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, open inguinal hernia repair, and laparoscopic appendectomy from July 2010 to July 2012. We divided the sample into 2 groups: \"attending alone\" (2010-2011) and \"with residents\" (2011-2012). The ORT was calculated by \"Cut time\" and \"Close time,\" as recorded in the OR. ORT for both groups was calculated using the unpaired t test. RESULTS: Of the total number of patients, 778 underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 407 underwent open inguinal hernia repair, and 273 underwent laparoscopic appendectomy; of these, 620, 315, and 211 procedures, respectively, were done by the attending alone and 158, 92, and 62, respectively, were done with residents.

METHODS: A 12-month retrospective review was conducted of ENT epistaxis admissions. Admission details such as length of in-patient stay, clotting profile and management plan were recorded. Comparisons of management and outcome for warfarinised and non-warfarinised patients were made using the Fisher's exact paired t-test. RESULTS: Of 176 epistaxis patients admitted, 31 per cent were warfarinised, 18 per cent were on another form of anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy, and 51 per cent were not on any medication that might impose a bleeding risk. The international normalised ratio at admission was high in 13 per cent of warfarinised patients; the remaining patients had therapeutic or sub-therapeutic international normalised ratios and so warfarin was continued. The mean in-patient stay was similar for all cohorts; however, warfarinised patients had a higher readmission rate.",

METHODS: The development of syphilis in Austria and Vienna was determined based on the data published by the Austrian Bureau of National Statistics (Statistik Austria) and the Vienna Health Authority (Gesundheitsamt Wien, MA15), respectively. The data obtained for Vienna were then compared with those for the remaining eight federal provinces. Also, we retrospectively analysed a total of 34,312 sera obtained between 1988 and 1999 from women screened for syphilis at delivery at the laboratory of the Department of Dermatology, University of Vienna. Serological screening was done with both the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) and the Treponema pallidum haemagglutination (TPHA) assays. Finally, we determined the number of cases of congenital syphilis diagnosed in Vienna between 1988 and 1999. RESULTS: In the past 10 years, the annual number of reported syphilis cases has remained fairly constant. In 1999 and 2000, there were 8.1 and 11.0 notifications of syphilis per 100,000 inhabitants in the capital Vienna, compared with 0.7 and 0.9 in the remaining provinces with a mainly rural character.

However, its short-term prognostic superiority over the traditional Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score has not been definitely confirmed. The creatinine serum level is an important predictor of survival in patients with liver cirrhosis. AIMS: To evaluate and compare the short-term prognostic accuracy of the CTP, the creatinine-modified CTP, and the MELD scores in patients with liver cirrhosis. METHODS: CTP, creatinine-modified CTP, and MELD scores were calculated in a cohort of 145 cirrhotic patients. The creatinine-modified CTP was calculated as follows: we assessed the mean creatinine serum level and standard deviation (SD) of the 145 study patients, then assigned a score of 1 to patients with creatinine serum levels<or = to the mean, a score of 2 to patients with creatinine levels between the mean and the mean+1 SD, and a score of 3 to patients with creatinine levels above the mean+1 SD. The creatinine-modified CTP was then calculated by simply adding each patients' creatinine score to their traditional CTP scores. We calculated and compared the accuracy (c-index) of the three parameters in predicting 3-month survival. RESULTS: The creatinine-modified CTP score showed better prognostic accuracy as compared with the traditional CTP (P=0.049). However, the MELD score proved to be better at defining patients' prognosis in the short-term as compared with both the traditional CTP and the creatinine-modified CTP (P=0.001).",

This study investigated the level of agreement between ABP and HBP in the diagnosis of masked hypertension. METHODS: Participants referred to an outpatient hypertension clinic had measurements of CBP (two visits), HBP (4 days), and ABP (24 h). The diagnosis of masked hypertension based on HBP (CBP<140/90 mm Hg and HBP>or =135/85) versus ABP (CBP<140/90 and awake ABP>or =135/85) was compared. RESULTS: A total of 438 subjects were included (mean age +/- SD, 51.5 +/- 11.6 years; 59% men and 41% women, 34% treated and 66% untreated). Similar proportions of subjects with masked hypertension were diagnosed by ABP (14.2%) and HBP (11.9%). In both treated and untreated subjects, the masked hypertension phenomenon was as common as the white coat phenomenon. Among 132 subjects with normal CBP, there was disagreement in the diagnosis of masked hypertension between the HBP and the ABP method in 23% of subjects for systolic and 30% for diastolic BP (kappa 0.56).

The objective of this hypothesis-generating, secondary analysis was to identify candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from those associated with opioid receptors, signalling or pain modulation to identify any related to intensity of breathlessness while on opioids. This can help to inform prospective studies and potentially lead to better tailoring of opioid therapy for refractory breathlessness. SETTING: 17 hospice/palliative care services (tertiary services) in 11 European countries. PARTICIPANTS: 2294 people over 18\u2005years of age on regular opioids for pain related to cancer or its treatment. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The relationship between morphine dose, breathlessness intensity (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire; EORTCQLQC30 question 8) and 112 candidate SNPs from 25 genes (n=588). SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The same measures for people on oxycodone (n=402) or fentanyl (n=429). RESULTS: SNPs not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium or with allele frequencies (<5%) were removed. Univariate associations between each SNP and breathlessness intensity were determined with Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate set at 20%. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression, clustering over country and adjusting for available confounders, was conducted with remaining SNPs. For univariate morphine associations, 1 variant on the 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3B (HTR3B) gene, and 4 on the \u03bc-opioid receptor (OPRM1) gene were associated with breathlessness intensity (p<0.05).

However, advanced disease is frequently associated with complications such as chronic venous insufficiency and superficial vein thrombosis. The pathogenic mechanisms are not well understood. Besides increased venous pressure, it is suggested that local blood constituents trigger various mechanisms responsible for the progression of the disease and its complications. DESIGN: The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in the blood in varicose veins and to compare them with the systemic markers of inflammation and endothelial damage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty patients with primary varicose veins were included in the study. Most patients were class C2. Blood samples were taken from the leg from the tortuous and dilated varicose tributaries of the great saphenous vein and from the cubital vein.

Hence, we aim to evaluate associations between impaired kidney function and early AMD, in a search for urinary biomarkers for AMD. METHODS: A population-based, cross-sectional analysis of persons aged 45 to 84 years was conducted with renal function measured using serum creatinine and cystatin C levels and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated. Age-related macular degeneration status was ascertained from retinal photographs. RESULTS: Of 5874 participants, 221 had early AMD. High serum cystatin C and low eGFR (\u226460 ml/min/1.73 m) were not associated with early AMD in our multivariate analyses. Among normotensive persons, however, highest versus other deciles of cystatin C were associated with an increased prevalence of early AMD (odds ratio, 1.80; 95% confidence interval, 1.00 to 3.23).",

DESIGN: Surveillance data collected from 1990 to 1999 were analysed. Height-for-age Z-scores were calculated using three norms: the WHO standards, the 1978 National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) reference and the 1990 British growth reference (UK90). SETTING: Bangladesh. SUBJECTS: Boys and girls aged 6-59 months (n 504 358). RESULTS: The three sets of growth curves provided conflicting pictures of the relative growth of girls and boys by age and over time. Conclusions on sex differences in growth depended also on the method used to analyse the curves, be it according to the shape or the relative position of the sex-specific curves. The shapes of the WHO-generated curves uniquely implied that Bangladeshi girls faltered faster or caught up slower than boys throughout their pre-school years, a finding consistent with the literature. In contrast, analysis of the relative position of the curves suggested that girls had higher WHO Z-scores than boys below 24 months of age.",

MATERIAL: A randomly selected, representative sample (26) of our patient series undergoing anterior cervical fusion with bicortical screw fixation (250) during period of 1993-1999 is reviewed in this study with respect to an exact position of the tips of the screws to the posterior vertebral cortex. A total of 109 screws were assessed. METHODS: The position of 109 screws was assessed using an axial CT scan. On the basis of the distance of the screw tip from the posterior cortex of the vertebra, the screws were divided into several categories: mono- and bicortically anchored. Bicortically inserted screws were statistically evaluated using the confidence interval. RESULTS: Statistical analysis shows that the confidence interval of the screws being bicortically anchored lies between 66.7 and 87.5% (alpha value = 0.01). No screw was introduced more than 3 mm behind the posterior vertebral cortex. Monocortical introduction more than 1.5 mm in front of the cortex was observed in 7 screws (6.4%) in lower cervical spine and cervico-thoracic junction. DISCUSSION: All the screws that were classified as being too short were introduced in the cervico-thoracical junction or lower cervical spine known for its reduced X-ray transparency. The majority of screws, primarily described as bicortical, indeed penetrated both vertebral cortices. Considering the results of confidence interval for bicortical screw anchoring we conclude that 1 of 4 screws is not truly bicortical.",

A specific aim was to describe differences depending on disability pension diagnoses, and how the results were modified by sex and age. METHOD: The study comprised representative samples of Swedish women and men, who had been interviewed in any of the annual Swedish Surveys of Living Conditions between 1990 and 2007. Information on disability pension and diagnoses was added from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency's database (1991-2011). The mean number of years of follow-up for the 53920 women and men was twelve years (SD 5.5), and the study base was restricted to the ages 20 to 64 years of age. The predictors were related to disability pension by Cox's proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Social isolation and low societal participation were associated with future disability pension also after control for age, year of interview, socio demographic conditions and self reported longstanding illness. Lone individuals were at increased risk of disability pension, and the effect of living without children was modified by sex and age. An increase in risk was particularly noticeable among younger women who reported that they had sparse contacts with others, and no close friend. Both women and men who reported that they did not participate in political discussions and who could not appeal on a decision by a public authority were also at increased risk. The effects of social isolation were mainly attributed to disability pension with mental diagnoses, and to younger individuals.",

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: The evidence for the effectiveness of screening is strongest for women ages 50 to 69 years; however, there is variation in the target age group for screening programs between different countries. In particular, there is uncertainty over whether women should continue screening once they reach age 70. We therefore investigated incidence rates for invasive and in situ breast cancer by age as well as prognostic features of tumors within a screening program. METHODS: We studied 474,808 women who attended BreastScreen Victoria from January 1, 1993 to December 31, 2000. Of these women, 5,301 were diagnosed with invasive cancer and 1,127 were diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ. We used generalized additive models to model age-incidence rates for invasive cancers and ductal carcinoma in situ separately by users and nonusers of hormone replacement therapy at most recent screen. Nonparametric trends for ordered groups and regression methods were used to investigate trends in size, grade, and nodal involvement for invasive tumors by type of attendance and time since previous negative screen for age group. RESULTS: The incidence of ductal carcinoma in situ among women with a previous negative screen clearly declined after age 70 irrespective of hormone replacement therapy use. At subsequent screen, the age-incidence curve for invasive breast cancer flattened at ages 60 to 75 years and then increased only for women taking hormone replacement therapy. Tumor size at diagnosis declined with age at both first round (P = 0.15) and subsequent round (P = 0.08). The proportion of poorly differentiated tumors also decreased with age, with the smallest proportion of grade III tumors diagnosed in women ages>or = 75 years (P = 0.001).",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Retrotransposons are key players in the evolution of eukaryotic genomes. Moreover, it is now known that some retrotransposon classes, like the abundant and plant-specific Sireviruses, have intriguingly distinctive host preferences. Yet, it is largely unknown if this bias is supported by different genome structures. RESULTS: We performed sensitive comparative analysis of the genomes of a large set of Ty1/copia retrotransposons. We discovered that Sireviruses are unique among Pseudoviridae in that they constitute an ancient genus characterized by vastly divergent members, which however contain highly conserved motifs in key non-coding regions: multiple polypurine tract (PPT) copies cluster upstream of the 3' long terminal repeat (3'LTR), of which the terminal PPT tethers to a distinctive attachment site and is flanked by a precisely positioned inverted repeat. Their LTRs possess a novel type of repeated motif (RM) defined by its exceptionally high copy number, symmetry and core CGG-CCG signature. These RM boxes form CpG islands and lie a short distance upstream of a conserved promoter region thus hinting towards regulatory functions. Intriguingly, in the envelope-containing Sireviruses additional boxes cluster at the 5' vicinity of the envelope. The 5'LTR/internal domain junction and a polyC-rich integrase signal are also highly conserved domains of the Sirevirus genome.",

It has been suggested that doctors adopt a more patient-centred consulting style in order to encourage patient satisfaction and shared decision-making. No evidence exists that such changes are achievable. We developed a new, on-site method for training postgraduates and used this for teaching patient-centred intervention. Here, we examine whether this training method is associated with changes in consulting patterns in consultations for sore throat with children, among doctors from a single group practice. METHODS: Audiotaped consultations (simulated and real) conducted before and after training were analysed and interviews were carried out with participants about the impact of training. SETTING: A general practice in South Wales. PARTICIPANTS: Four general practitioners who consulted with 25 real and simulated patients participated in the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Four patient-centred skills used by doctors and 2 patient behaviours measured before and after training were identified. RESULTS: Three out of 4 practitioners produced clear evidence of changes in patient-centred consulting skills. These changes were evident in simulated and real consultations 2 and 4 weeks later, respectively. Prior to training the doctors produced only five examples of patient-centred skills in 10 consultations. After training they produced 39 examples in 15 consultations.",

METHODS: Twenty competitive swimmers (with a training frequency of 8.0 \u00b1 1.0 sessions/wk) performed 2 maximal 100-m freestyle trials on separate days, with and without prior warm-up, in a counterbalanced and randomized design. The warm-up distance totaled 1000 m and replicated the swimmers' usual precompetition warm-up strategy. Performance (time), physiological (capillary blood lactate concentrations), psychophysiological (perceived exertion), and biomechanical variables (distance per stroke, stroke frequency, and stroke index) were assessed on both trials. RESULTS: Performance in the 100-m was fastest in the warm-up condition (67.15 \u00b1 5.60 vs 68.10 \u00b1 5.14 s; P = .01), although 3 swimmers swam faster without warm-up.

Besides initial symptoms, psychosocial characteristics of individuals may influence their help-seeking behaviour. We explored the role of disease characteristics, illness perception, and coping in patient-related delay before treatment initiation in recently diagnosed patients with ERA. METHOD: This exploratory, cross-sectional study included 112 patients with ERA from the Care for early RA (CareRA) trial for whom complete data on patient-related delay, coping, and illness perception were available. In addition to baseline sociodemographic and clinical data, the patients' psychosocial profiles were assessed with the Utrecht Coping List (UCL) and the revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R). Correlations were measured by Spearman's rho. Using regression analyses, we weighted the association of variables with patient-related delay.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the impact of different calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) concentrations of dialysis solutions on serum Mg and serum PTH levels in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two groups of PD patients-group A (n = 17) on \"standard\" Ca and Mg dialysis solution (SCa-MgD) (Ca: 1.62 mmol/l, Mg: 0.75 mmol/l and Lactate 35 mmol/l), and group B (n = 29) on \"low\" Ca and Mg dialysis solution (LCa-MgD) (Ca: 1.25 mmol/l, Mg: 0.25 mmol/l and Lactate 40 mmol/l), on PD for more than 6 months, were studied. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) was used as the phosphate (P) binder in 87% (40/46) of the patients. Biochemical parameters were evaluated every 1-2 months over 6 months and the mean values were computed.

As a prerequisite for any proposed procedure for ovarian cancer screening, high levels of specificity should be obtained using combinations of tests. Based on preliminary data from an ongoing feasibility study, this report is focused on the possible gain in specificity provided by fine-needle aspiration of occult ovarian masses detected by ultrasound. METHODS: Ultrasonography was used as a basic test, and fine-needle aspiration was obtained from selected patients. Those with (a) positive aspiration cytology or histology, (b) complex or solid masses showing volume increase, (c) complex or irregular masses and inadequate samples, and (d) recurrent cystic lesions were operated on. RESULTS: A total of 3541 asymptomatic patients 50-69 years of age underwent ultrasonography, and 98 were selected for fine-needle aspiration. Of these, 19 (positivity rate 19/3541 or 0.5%) were operated on. Two ovarian cancer cases (FIGO Stage II and III) were detected (detection rate 2/3541 or 0.6 x 1,000; positive predictive value 2/19 or 10.5%). Specificity was 3443/3539 or 97.3% for ultrasound alone and 3522/3539 or 99.5% for the procedure as a whole.

DESIGN: A cohort study. SETTING: University research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Patients (N=44) with idiopathic PD. INTERVENTION: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants were evaluated on their isokinetic knee extensor strength. Additionally, participants completed an assessment of their postural stability (Functional Reach Test for static stability and a dynamic postural stability assessment as measured by the center of pressure-center of mass moment arm during gait initiation). Participants also underwent an evaluation of their functional ambulation as measured by a 6-minute walk test. Lastly, participants were evaluated by a neurologist specially trained in movement disorders to assess neurologic status and disease severity using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and the Hoehn and Yahr disability score. RESULTS: Knee extensor strength positively correlated with dynamic postural stability and negatively correlated with disease severity. Further, dynamic postural stability was negatively correlated to disease severity and positively correlated with functional ambulation in this cohort of patients with PD (P<.05). The results also suggest that the Functional Reach Test may be a valuable assessment tool to examine postural stability in PD.",

METHODS: We compared the selective or ipsilateral isolation of the PVs triggering AF (SePVI: n = 42) and EmPVI (n = 35) in 77 patients (males 80.5%, mean age 53.0 +/- 13.4 years) with PAF who underwent radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA). Arrhythmogenic PVs were identified by the immediate recurrence of AF three consecutive times after cardioverting AF. RESULTS: (1) The duration of the RF energy deliveries (P<0.01) and total procedure time (P<0.01) were shorter for the SePVI than the EmPVI. (2) During a mean follow-up of 38.6 +/- 23.1 months, the AF recurrence rate was 38.1% in the SePVI group and 25.7% in the EmPVI group (P = NS). (3) A redo-ablation was performed in 25 patients, and 81.0% of the recurrent arrhythmogenic foci were found at a previously ablated PV or ipsilateral PV. (4) In 15.4% of the SePVI and 20.0% of the EmPVI procedures, AF recurred after 32.5 +/- 15.2 months of the redo-ablation. Subsequently, the AF-free rate for each group was 88.1% (37/42) in the SePVI and 83.3% (29/35) in the EmPVI (P = NS).",

Pressure-regulated volume control ventilation (PRVCV) has been suggested to be the best option, as it should ensure a prefixed tidal volume at the lowest peak inspiratory pressure. We sought to determine the accuracy of the delivered volume, compared with the programmed volume, when using PRVCV. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experimental work performing ventilation simulations using volume control ventilation (VCV), PRVCV, and pressure control ventilation (PCV). Each mode was tested at tidal volumes (TVs) of 200 and 500 mL at both low and high airway resistance. Evita XL and Servo-i ventilators were used. RESULTS: At 200 ml TV with high resistance, volume delivered with Evita XL was 165 mL (95% confidence interval, 158-169) in VCV, 117 mL (95% confidence interval, 117-120) in PCV, and 120 (95% confidence interval, 115-121) in PRVCV (P<.001).

Recent trials have demonstrated an association between beta blocker (BB) use and improved outcomes after injury. The mechanisms through which BB result in improved outcomes remain poorly elucidated. In vitro evidence supports that BB modulates the postinjury inflammatory response. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of BB on inflammatory profiles in injured patients at increased risk for heart disease. METHODS: A pseudo-randomized, controlled trial of injured patients over 55 admitted to the intensive care unit was conducted. Patients were randomized to receive continuous BB or standard of care. Patients with a reported history of prehospital BB use were enrolled into an observational arm of the trial, continued on BB, and analyzed with the continuous BB group. Plasma interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1beta levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at baseline and day 1, 2, and 4 after BB initiation. Cytokine data were log transformed for normality assumptions. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to test for within-group differences in cytokine levels over time. RESULTS: Forty-two patients were enrolled. Seventeen patients were randomized to the control group and 25 patients received continuous BB (10 randomized/15 observational). There was no difference in gender, age, prior history of heart disease, or admission heart rate, systolic blood pressure or initial base deficit between groups. Baseline levels of IL-6 and IL-1beta did not differ between groups. Levels of IL-6, but not IL-1beta, decreased over time in patients receiving BB (p = 0.04), whereas levels in controls remained unchanged (p = 0.27). There were no BB related complications.",

The aim of this article is to report the mid-term functional and radiographic outcome of this technique when complete watertight rotator cuff healings were achieved and to investigate the usefulness of the trapezius transfer. The hypothesis of this work was that the trapezius transfer could not be considered as a useful treatment option. MATERIALS: The study included 20 shoulders demonstrating watertight healing of the rotator cuff on arthro CT-scan control performed 13.5 months after open surgery consisting of a trapezius transfer and suture of all other torn tendons. The mean age at surgery was 58.4 years. The trapezius transfer operative technique is described. METHODS: The functional status of the shoulders was assessed preoperatively and at a mean follow-up of 30 months according to the non-weighted Constant score and by measurement of active external rotation, arm at the side. Radiographic and CT-scan assessments were performed preoperatively and at a mean follow-up of 28.5 months. The functional results obtained at last follow-up were compared with those \"theoretically estimated\" after anatomically successful suture of the torn supra and infraspinatous without associated repair of the torn subscapularis. RESULTS: Between the pre- and postoperative periods, pain, daily activities and Constant score had all statistically improved. Arthritis was not aggravated but the preoperative anterior subluxation of the humeral head persisted in most cases.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of the literature published in this area from 1992-2012, with no language restrictions. The following databases were used MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL, Google Scholar, LILACS and Pubmed. We also hand-searched the reference sections of all selected papers. We included all prospective studies evaluating the effect of compensation status on outcomes in adult patients who had undergone surgery due to orthopaedic conditions or diseases.

All patients were evaluated according to age, gender, diabetes duration, 3-phase bone scintigraphy, Doppler ultrasound, amputation/reamputation levels, and hospitalization periods. Patients underwent 3-phase bone scintigraphy using technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate, and the most distal site of the region displaying perfusion during the perfusion and early blood flow phase was marked as the amputation level. Amputation level was determined by 3-phase bone scintigraphy, Doppler ultrasound, and inspection of the infection-free clear region during surgery. RESULTS: The amputation levels of the patients were as follows: finger in six (20%), ray amputation in five (16.6%), transmetatarsal in one (3.3%), Lisfranc in two (6.6%), Chopart in seven (23.3%), Syme in one (3.3%), below-the-knee in six (20%), above the knee in one (3.3%), knee disarticulation in one (3.3%), and two patients underwent amputation at other centers. After primary amputation, reamputation was performed on seven patients, and one patient was treated with debridement for wound site problems. No mortality was encountered during study.",

        "input": "METHODS: In a sample of 183 young adults from French-speaking Switzerland, data on alcohol consumption, whereabouts and drinking companions were collected using questionnaires sent to participants' cell phones at five time points from 5 p.m. to midnight every Thursday, Friday and Saturday over five consecutive weeks. Means and proportion tests and multilevel models were conducted based on 6650 assessments recorded on 1441 evenings. RESULTS: Over the study period, predrinkers drank more frequently than did non-predrinkers and, among males, predrinkers drank more heavily. Predrinking was related to increased drinking duration and thus total consumption in the evenings. Larger groups of people were reported for predrinking compared with off-premise only drinking situations. Among women, the consumption of straight spirits (i.e. not mixed with soft drinks) while predrinking was associated with higher total evening alcohol consumption. Among men, drinking with exclusively male friends or female friends while predrinking was associated with higher consumption.",

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: Childhood adversities have been linked to elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), which has been associated with increased morbidity. Low social support has been reported to worsen the prognosis in heart disease and cancer, and high social support has been linked to lower hsCRP. We hypothesized that social support could be a mediating factor between childhood adversities and hsCRP. METHODS: The sample was drawn from the data of the nationwide Health and Social Support Study (HeSSup Study) to which 25,898 Finns had responded in 1998. The cohort was stratified into groups of high and low social support, and the study group consisted of 100 women in both groups. Additionally, we invited a randomly drawn group of 50 subjects and a group of 62 women who had reported depressive symptoms. Of the 312 women, 116 participated in the study. RESULTS: Social support score (Social Support Questionnaire, SSQ) was lower when the number of adverse experiences in childhood was high (r = - 0.251, P = 0.007). hsCRP and SSQ were inversely associated (r = - 0.188, P = 0.046). In the adjusted general linear model, the level of social support was significantly associated with hsCRP and there was a statistically significant interactive effect of small effect size of childhood adversities and the level of social support on hsCRP (ES = 0.123, P = 0.004).",

AIMS: To evaluate quality of life (QOL) in cirrhotic (compensated and decompensated) and non-cirrhotic patients with chronic HCV infection, using preference-based (utilities) and non-preference-based methods of evaluating QOL. METHODS: In a tertiary care setting, 271 patients completed a self-administered time trade-off utility instrument, the Health Utility Index Mark 2 and Mark 3, and the Hepatitis Quality of Life Questionnaire Version 2. Mean QOL scores were compared across HCV disease stages and sociodemographical categories. We examined the association between QOL and disease stage using linear regression adjusting for age, education, marital status, log income and Charlson comorbidity scores. Mean utility scores were compared across disease stages using a propensity score method. RESULTS: Mean utilities were lower than general population norms (0.81-0.92) and ranged from 0.62 to 0.82 in non-cirrhotic patients (n=197), 0.56-0.84 in compensated cirrhotic patients (n=17) and 0.55-0.76 for decompensated cirrhotic patients (n=57). No significant association found was between disease stage and utility for current health status.

We aimed to assess if such a program, without the explicit aim to improve health, results in area-based interventions that address the social determinants of health to such an extent that future health impacts may be expected. METHODS: We used standardized questionnaires and face-to-face interviews with 39 local district managers. We analyzed the content of the area-based interventions to assess if the activities addressed the social determinants of health. We assessed the duration and scale of the activities in order to estimate their potential to change social determinants of health. RESULTS: Most districts addressed all six categories of social determinants of health central to the procedural program. Investments in broad-based primary schools, housing stock, green space, and social safety seemed to have the potential to result in district-level changes in social determinants. The scale of activities aimed at employment, income, educational attainment, and the social environment seemed too small to expect an impact at the district level.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Adding temozolomide (TMZ) to standard radiotherapy as a first-line therapy for glioma may increase costs to a disproportionate degree compared with the resulting survival benefits. METHODS: Forty-six consecutive patients (28 males and 18 females; median age, 52 years; age range, 24-70 years) received concomitant TMZ with radiotherapy for 6 weeks followed by adjuvant TMZ for 6 cycles, and they were followed until disease recurrence and then until death. The authors assessed the costs associated with the four phases of treatment from a hospital-centered perspective. RESULTS: Treatment was discontinued early in 3 patients, 9 patients, and 15 patients during concomitant TMZ, before adjuvant TMZ, and during adjuvant TMZ, respectively. Karnofsky index values varied between 85% (at the beginning of treatment) and 76% (at the end of treatment). The nature of care after disease recurrence was diverse. Overall survival ranged from 1.4 months to 64.3 months (median, 15.8 months) and was better if surgical debulking could be carried out before treatment. Global costs amounted to Euros 39,092 +/- Euros 21,948 (concomitant TMZ, Euros 14,539 +/- Euros 4998; adjuvant TMZ, Euros 13,651 +/- Euros 4320; follow-up, Euros 6363 +/- Euros 6917; and recurrence, Euros 12,344 +/- Euros 18,327), with 53% of these costs being related to the acquisition of TMZ; this represented an eightfold increase in the cost of treatment compared with radiotherapy alone.",

To better understand the likelihood of -- and barriers to -- informed consent in trauma patients, we evaluated when and how consent is possible in acutely injured patients. STUDY DESIGN: Over a 7-month period, at a large, urban, adult Level I trauma center, we prospectively assessed each patient's ability to give hypothetical informed consent. Patients were considered consentable when they were alert, unintoxicated, and stable, with no prohibitive language barrier, or when a proxy (first-degree relative) was available. When consent was not feasible on arrival, we documented the reason and the time at which consent became possible, either by the patient or proxy. RESULTS: Of 1,328 consecutive trauma patients, 1,020 (77%) were candidates for consent (personal or proxy) within 30 minutes of arrival. Twenty-five percent of patients with hypotension in the resuscitation area were consentable, as were 31% of severely injured (Injury Severity Score>24) patients. Eight hours after injury, 88% of all patients were consentable, as were 60% of severely injured patients and 36% of patients with initial hypotension. Primary barriers to consent included brain injury or unspecified alteration in awareness (41%), intoxication (28%), shock (26%), language barrier (2%), or medication (3%).",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Surveillance of sexually transmissible infections (STI)s is important to assess the disease burden in the population and to monitor and evaluate changes in trends over time. Routinely collected surveillance data in New South Wales are reliant on case reporting, which for many infections is an inadequate mechanism for capturing incidence and prevalence. Increasing rates of chlamydia over the past decade have sparked intense debate as to whether the current notification system is optimal and whether the true burden of infection are being measured. This study describes the current surveillance for STIs in New South Wales. METHODS: New South Wales-specific data for the years 2000-2009 were analysed. Notification data were used to examine the rate of the 4 STIs that are notifiable in New South Wales; chlamydia, gonorrhoea, infectious syphilis and HIV notifications. Hospital admissions and chlamydia-associated pelvic inflammatory disease were analysed using admitted patient data. RESULTS: Chlamydia was the most frequently reported of the notifiable STIs in New South Wales. Despite the higher rates of notification compared with other STIs, chlamydia-related hospitalisations contribute less than a 5th of all STI-related hospital admissions. Infectious syphilis contributed to the highest proportion of all STI-related hospitalisations in New South Wales and rates increased from 2000 to 2009. For other STIs such as anogenital herpes and gonorrhoea, hospital admissions remained stable for the same period.",
        "output": "The current surveillance system for STIs in New South Wales is inadequate for measuring the true burden of infection. The notification system is biased towards chlamydia, which is the most frequently reported STI in New South Wales. This is due to the high prevalence of chlamydia in the population and the high number of asymptomatic cases. The notification system does not capture the true burden of infection for other STIs, such as infectious syphilis, which is the second most frequently reported STI in New South Wales. The notification system also does not capture the burden of STIs that are notifiable in other states, such as gonorrhoea and anogenital herpes. The current system of surveillance for STIs in New South Wales is inadequate and needs to be improved."

The strongest systemic disease associated is diabetes mellitus (DM). Many treatment options are used for NL with variable success. To verify if reversal of the diabetic state is related to improvement of NL, we compared the evolution of NL lesions in patients who received a pancreas transplant with those who received a kidney. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of diabetic patients with NL who underwent transplant. RESULTS: A total of fifteen patients were identified and divided into two groups: group I (n = 11) consisted of patients who underwent pancreas only or pancreas plus kidney transplant, group II (n = 4) underwent kidney only transplant. Of the eleven patients in Group I, five had NL lesions at the time of transplant and all achieved resolution of these lesions. One patient experienced recurrence of NL associated with transplant rejection. In group II, one patient who had NL lesions at the time of transplant had persistent lesions after the transplant.

These risk factors are similar to those for generation of stripe wear. However, it is unclear whether the biomechanical conditions contributing to stripe wear generation also increase the risk for ceramic liner fractureQUESTIONS/ PURPOSES: We asked whether (1) head stripe wear propensity; and (2) cup orientation would correlate with alumina liner fracture risk for instances of normal and elevated body weight. METHODS: An eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) model was developed to investigate these mechanisms. Liner fracture risk for 36-mm alumina bearings was studied by simulating two fracture-prone motions: stooping and squatting. Twenty-five distinct cup orientations were considered with variants of both acetabular inclination and anteversion. Four separate body mass indices were considered: normal (25\u00a0kg/m(2)) and three levels of obesity (33, 42, and 50\u00a0kg/m(2)). Material properties were modified to simulate alumina with and without the presence of dispersed microflaws. The model was validated by corroboration with two previously published ceramic liner fracture studies. RESULTS: Of 200 XFEM simulations with flaw-free alumina, fracture occurred in eight instances, all of them involving obesity. Each of these occurred with cups in\u00a0\u2264\u00a037\u00b0 inclination and in 0\u00b0 anteversion. For 200 corresponding simulations with microflawed alumina, fracture propensity was greatest for cups with higher (edge loading-associated) scraping wear. Fracture risk was greatest for cups with lower inclination (average 42\u00b0 for fractured cases) and higher anteversion (average 12\u00b0 for fractured cases).",

        "input": "CONTEXT: A delay of 4-8weeks before modifying the prescribed antidepressant treatment is usually proposed when incomplete treatment response is observed. A number of studies nevertheless proposed that the lack of early improvement (usually 20% decrease of severity at week 2) is predictive of the absence of subsequent treatment response, potentially saving weeks of inadequate treatment, but with no information for non-interventional studies devoted to outpatients. METHOD: Two thousand nine hundred and thirty-eight outpatients with major depressive disorder were included in a multicentre, non-interventional study, assessing at inclusion, week 2 and week 6, mood (QIDS-C, CGI, PGI and VAS) sleep (LSEQ) and functionality (SDS). All metrics at week 2 were tested for their capacity to predict response (and then remission) at week 6, all patients being treated by agomelatine. A meta-analysis of all studies (n=12) assessing the predictive role of improvement at week 2 was also performed, assessing specific effect size of published studies and the weight of the different parameters they used. RESULTS: The QIDS-C and the CGI-I were the only instruments with an area under the curve over 0.7, with different cut-offs for treatment response and remission. A decrease of more than five points at the QIDS-C had the highest positive predictive value for treatment response, and a CGI-I over three had the highest negative predictive value, which would favour relying on the clinicians for warning (too high CGI-I), and on instruments for confidence (favourable decrease of the QIDS-C). The meta-analysis of all studies also detected a large effect size of early improvement, stressing how rating week 2 severity could be beneficial in clinical practice.",
        "output": "The QIDS-C and the CGI-I are the most useful instruments to assess early improvement in major depressive disorder, with a decrease of more than five points at the QIDS-C having the highest positive predictive value for treatment response, and a CGI-I over three having the highest negative predictive value."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) rate after performing transperineal interstitial permanent prostate brachytherapy (TIPPB) in conjunction with cystoscopy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One-hundred twenty-five patients underwent TIPPB and cystoscopy. All patients received intravenous perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. No postimplant antibiotic medication was prescribed. All patients were evaluated at 1-month follow- up for symptomatic UTI. No screening (U/A, C+S) was performed for asymptomatic patients. Any UTI within 1 month of TIPPB was considered a complication and scored as an infection. RESULTS: Of 125 patients who underwent TIPPB and cystoscopy, one patient (1%) developed a symptomatic UTI. In our study, a one-time perioperative intravenous dose of cefazolin (Ancef) without additional postoperative antibiotics resulted in an overall symptomatic UTI rate of 1%. Hence, additional postoperative antibiotics may not be warranted, thus providing a cost saving (500 mg of ciprofloxacin orally, two times a day for 5 days at a cost of $44.95) and reducing the potential risk of antibiotic resistance.",

        "input": "PURPOSE: Ventricular catheter drainage holes of shunt systems used to treat hydrocephalus obstruct with tissue commonly comprising monocytes/macrophages, astrocytes, and giant cells. Despite high rates of obstruction, very few studies have manipulated drainage hole orientation, number, position, or diameter. By altering the hole diameter but maintaining a constant hole surface area, we manipulated shear stress through the holes, which we hypothesized would change the degree of macrophage and astrocyte attachment. METHODS: First, a hole fabrication method was chosen from two fabrication techniques including punched holes in catheter tubing and constructed holes using nanofabrication techniques. RESULTS: Punched holes were chosen to vary hole size from 282 to 975\u00a0\u03bcm because (1) samples were geometrically similar to commercially available ventricular catheters without significant microscopic differences in roughness values and (2) total macrophage and astrocyte adhesion on the punched holes was not significantly different from adhesion on the commercially available catheters. Overall adhesion from least to most adherent appeared to follow 975\u2009<\u2009754\u2009\u2248\u2009500\u2009<\u2009282-\u03bcm hole diameter for macrophages and 975\u2009<\u2009500\u2009<\u2009754\u2009<\u2009282 for astrocytes with an obvious dependency on catheter orientation with respect to the horizontal; a dependency to the proximity of the hole to the catheter tip was not observed.",

We hypothesized that the presence of ultrasound would affect clinical decision making as evidenced through abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scan use in blunt multiple trauma patients. METHODS: This study used a prospective randomized format in an urban county ED with Level II trauma center status (ED census, 72,000 patients per year). Participants were patients with multiple blunt injuries meeting trauma center triage criteria. Patients were randomized to receive either abdominal ultrasound or no ultrasound (control) during initial ED resuscitation. The primary outcome variable was use of abdominal CT scan in patients with and without ultrasound. RESULTS: Two hundred eight patients were enrolled. The mean age was 40 +/- 18 years, and 62% were men. Mechanism of injury was motor vehicle crash, 56%; automobile versus pedestrian, 18%; motorcycle crash, 16%; falls, 10%; and other, 10%. One hundred four ultrasound and 104 control patients were analyzed. There were no apparent differences between ultrasound and control groups in demographics, injury type, or Injury Severity Score. Fifty-four of 104 (52%) of the control group received abdominal CT scans versus 37 of 104 (36%) abdominal CT scans for the ultrasound group; mean difference in proportions was 15.9 (p<0.01; 95% confidence interval, 2.6-29.1).",

However, patients included in high-quality studies may differ from the routine population and alter external validity of recommendations. We aimed to determine to what extent non-inclusion criteria of RCTs dealing with severe sepsis and septic shock may affect application of their conclusions in routine care. METHODS: In a first step, the MEDLINE database was searched for RCTs treating severe sepsis and septic shock patients between 1992 and 2008, and non-inclusion criteria for these studies were abstracted. Two reviewers independently evaluated the articles, which were checked by a third reviewer. We extracted data on the study design, main intervention, primary endpoint, criteria for inclusion, and criteria for non-inclusion. In a second step, the distribution of the non-inclusion criteria was observed in a prospective multicenter cohort of severe sepsis and septic shock patients (Cub-Rea network, 1992 to 2008). RESULTS: We identified 96 articles out of 7,012 citations that met the screening criteria. Congestive heart failure (35%) and cancer (30%) were frequent exclusion criteria in selected studies, as well as other frequent disorders such as gastrointestinal and liver diseases and all causes of immune suppression. Of the 67,717 patients with severe sepsis and septic shock in the Cub-Rea database, 40,325 (60%) experienced at least one of the main exclusion criteria, including 11% of congestive heart failure patients and 11% of cancer patients. In addition, we observed a significant trend for increasing number of patients with these criteria along time.",

Non-smokers, and especially recent ex-smokers, have an increased risk of ulcerative colitis (UC). Conversely, concerning Crohn's disease, the risk is increased among smokers. Pouchitis is the major long-term complication of restorative proctocolectomy for UC, and seems to be pathogenetically related to this condition. The aims of this study were to test the hypothesis that smoking reduces the risk of pouchitis, and to investigate whether cessation of smoking precedes the onset of the inflammation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All living patients operated on for UC with proctocolectomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) between November 1982 and November 1996 at Sahlgren's University Hospital were included in the study (n=410). Data concerning smoking habits and pouchitis were obtained from questionnaires and from medical records. The correlation between smoking habits and incidence of pouchitis was statistically evaluated by means of a survival test and a multivariate analysis, i.e. a Poisson model. RESULTS: In all, 327 patients (80%) completed the questionnaires. Ninety-six (29%) of these patients had had at least one episode of pouchitis. Smoking habits during follow-up did not significantly influence the risk of pouchitis (p=0.29). Nor did smoking habits before and at the time of IPAA correlate with the incidence of pouchitis. Women had a decreased risk of pouchitis, compared to men (p=0.014). There was a non-significant tendency for smoking to increase the risk, which was more pronounced in women.",

For most taxa, the underlying cellular pathways and timing of the elimination process is only poorly understood. In the water frog hybrid Pelophylax esculentus (parental taxa are P. ridibundus and P. lessonae) the only described mechanism assumes that one parental genome is excluded from the germline during metamorphosis and prior to meiosis, while only second genome enters meiosis after endoreduplication. Our study of hybrids from a P. ridibundus-P. esculentus-male populations known for its production of more types of gametes shows that hybridogenetic mechanism of genome elimination is not uniform. RESULTS: Using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) on mitotic and meiotic cell stages, we identified at least two pathways of meiotic mechanisms. One type of Pelophylax esculentus males provides supporting evidence of a premeiotic elimination of one parental genome. In several other males we record the presence of both parental genomes in the late phases of meiotic prophase I (diplotene) and metaphase I.",

METHODS: Quality of life was arbitrarily considered to have improved significantly if the score decreases by more than 50% between pre-operatively and 36 months post-operatively. We investigated the pre-operative cut-off score predictive of no quality of life improvement at M36 from a prospective trial for surgical pelvic organ prolapse treatment. RESULTS: The most accurate pre-operative cut-off score predicting a failure to improve quality of life at 36 months post-operatively was 62/300 (PFDI Score). This cut-off value had a positive predictive value of 83.6% and specificity of 62.1%. No significant threshold was obtained from the PFIQ score.",

        "input": "INTRODUCTION: Decreasing mortality is an important objective of health improvement. We examined the progress in reducing overall mortality in Wisconsin over the last 2 decades in the age group spanning 45-64 years. Goals for reducing mortality and disparities in mortality by 2010 were addressed. METHODS: We examined trends in all cause mortality for Wisconsin from 1980-1999 for ages 45-64. Mortality data was also examined by subgroups (race and gender) and cause. Mortality data was abstracted from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's WONDER. RESULTS: From 1980-99, adults aged 45-64 experienced a 22% decline in mortality and, consequently, over 1720 lives were \"saved\" annually in Wisconsin in this age group between 1995-1999. Mortality in black men and women declined 8% and 10% respectively in this interval as compared to 27% for white males and 19% for white females (P<0.05 for all groups for temporal change in death rates). Significant declines in cardiovascular and cancer mortality were achieved. Deaths from injuries increased slightly. The black to white mortality ratio is projected to increase by 2010.",

METHODS: In this retrospective study, ten patients who developed vulvar ulcerations and denied any kind of sexual contact or sexual abuse were identified. Patient information was collated from detailed history, physical, and laboratory examinations including age, menarchal status, type of clothing worn, whether history of oral aphthosis or previous vulvar ulcers had occurred, symptoms at the time of presentation, description of ulcer, laboratory studies including serologies, blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and biopsy results. RESULTS: Despite multiple evaluations, no patient had a specific medical cause identified to account for their vulvar ulcerations. None were diagnosed with Behcet's syndrome. Seven had bilateral vulvar ulcerations, which we attribute to the practice of wearing tightly fitted pants or polyester underwear frequently. No recurrences were documented in 6 months follow-up.",

Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are common in severely injured patients potentially resulting in neurological impairment and permanent disability that would add to that from the musculoskeletal injuries. However, it is unclear to what degree the combination affects impairment.QUESTIONS/ PURPOSES: We therefore asked whether added upper extremity injuries or TBI worsened the functional, psychological, and vocational status in multiple trauma patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 281 patients with multiple trauma: 229 with upper extremity injuries but without TBI (Group I), 32 with concomitant upper extremity injuries and TBI (Group II), and 20 with TBI but no upper extremity injuries (Group III). We assessed patients with the Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS), Hannover Score for Polytrauma Outcome, SF-12 (Physical Component Summary Score and Mental Component Summary Score), medical aid requirements, need of psychological support, and vocational living circumstances. The minimum followup was 10 years (median, 17.5 years; range, 10-28 years). RESULTS: Additional TBI in multiple trauma patients led to reduced function (GOS: Group I: 4.9 \u00b1 0.2, Group II: 4.5 \u00b1 0.7, Group III: 4.5 \u00b1 0.8) resulting in vocational restrictions (job change: Group I: 74%, Group II: 91%, Group III: 90%).

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess various prenatal patterns in correlation with survival and the occurrence of complications of antenatally recognized gastroschisis (G). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 34 cases of G. Mortality and morbidity in the postnatal period were assessed and correlated with the prenatal presence or absence of: (1) bowel and/or stomach dilatation, (2) thickening and/or hyperechogenicity of the intestinal wall, (3) meconium peritonitis (in the abdomen) before 20 weeks of gestation, (4) asymmetrical bowel dilatation, and (5) associated malformations. Morbidity took into account the length of hospitalization and the number of surgical procedures. RESULTS: The overall survival rate was 94%. Neither bowel nor stomach dilatation was significantly correlated with mortality. However, evidence of intestinal dilatation greater than 17 mm had a positive predictive value of 67% for atresia, with a negative predictive value of 86%. Thickening and/or hyperechogenicity of the bowel wall were not significantly associated with mortality. Meconium peritonitis before 20 weeks and asymmetrical bowel dilatation were not statistically significant because of the small sample size. Twelve patients (35.3%) had postnatal complications, with a mean hospital stay of 127 days. Outcome was not modified by the mode of delivery. Associated extradigestive anomalies were present in 20.6% of cases. Chromosomal anomalies were not seen.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Many jurisdictions delivering health care, including Canada, have developed guidance for conducting economic evaluation, often in the service of larger health technology assessment (HTA) and reimbursement processes. Like any health intervention, personalized medical (PM) interventions have costs and consequences that must be considered by reimbursement authorities with limited resources. However, current approaches to economic evaluation to support decision making have been largely developed from population-based approaches to therapy-that is, evaluating the costs and consequences of single interventions across single populations. This raises the issue as to whether these methods, as they are or more refined, are adequate to address more targeted approaches to therapy, or whether a new paradigm for assessing value in PM is required. OBJECTIVES: We describe specific issues relevant to the economic evaluation of diagnostics-based PM and assess whether current guidance for economic evaluation is sufficient to support decision making for PM interventions. METHODS: Issues were identified through literature review and informal interviews with national and international experts (n = 10) in these analyses. This article elaborates on findings and discussion at a workshop held in Ottawa, Canada, in January 2012. RESULTS: Specific issues related to better guiding economic evaluation of personalized medicine interventions include: how study questions are developed, populations are characterized, comparators are defined, effectiveness is evaluated, outcomes are valued and how resources are measured. Diagnostics-based PM also highlights the need for analyses outside of economic evaluation to support decision making.",

METHODS: A retrospective, monocentric study of 148 patients admitted for acute type A aortic dissection. All patients underwent a clinical, echocardiographic and biological evaluation on admission. In 75 patients, we measured serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI). RESULTS: In hospital mortality was 25.9% and 15.6% presented with preoperative cardiac circulatory arrest (POCCA). Patients with POCCA were more likely than others to have hypotension (97+/-56 vs 144+/-24 mmHg, p<0.01) or shock (52% vs 3%, p<0.01) on admission. Pericardial effusion (65% vs 35%, p=0.01) and tamponade (61% vs 8%, p<0.01) were also significantly linked to POCCA but not the aortic ascendant diameter.

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to investigate the relationship between pre-hospital use of epinephrine and functional survival among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) who achieved successful ROSC. METHODS: We included all patients with OHCA who achieved successful ROSC admitted to a cardiac arrest center from January 2000 to August 2012. Use of epinephrine was coded as yes/no and by dose (none, 1 mg, 2 to 5 mg,>5 mg). A favorable discharge outcome was coded using a Cerebral Performance Category 1 or 2. Analyses incorporated multivariable logistic regression, propensity scoring, and matching methods.

OBJECTIVE: To observe the long-term temporal course of the height of human lumbar discs after chemonucleolysis. To document whether human lumbar discs reconstitute, thus characterizing the healing potential of central disc tissue. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Although reconstitution of disc height within some months of chemonucleolysis has been observed in animal experiments, human lumbar discs have shown no tendency to regain their initial height within 1 year of treatment. To date, there has been no report on longer follow-up periods. The different reactions of animal and human discs may be dose-related or related to differences in tissue properties, physiologic environment or in vivo loading conditions. METHODS: Using a new protocol, the heights of lumbar discs were measured from sets of lateral radiographic views of 51 patients subject to chemonucleolysis by treatment with chymopapain (doses of 4000 or 3000 picokatals [pkat]). The sets comprised a view taken before treatment, a view taken (on average) 4 months after treatment, and a view taken (on average) 81 months after treatment. In the majority of patients, untreated discs adjacent to discs treated with chemonucleolysis served as control discs. RESULTS: Shortly after injection of chymopapain, all treated discs decreased in height. The height decrease of treated discs amounted to 15.8% on average. In the subcohort treated with 4000 pkat, the loss did not reverse during the entire follow-up period; in the subcohort treated with 3000 pkat a small fraction of the lost height was regained. Untreated neighboring control discs showed a minor (3.2%) decrease in height.",

Several socio-demographic characteristics may compound this risk, but little is known about why this might be the case. Sedentary behaviors are emerging as a socio-demographically patterned risk factor for obesity. The purpose of the present study was to assess socio-demographic differences in sedentary behaviors, and to examine whether these behaviors could explain the relation between socio-demographic variables and BMI (BMI) in this risk group. METHODS: Women aged 18-46 years were recruited from 40 urban and 40 rural deprived neighborhoods in Victoria, Australia. In total, 3879 women reported socio-demographic variables (age, educational level, employment status, marital status, number of children, residential location and country of birth), sedentary behaviors (television time, computer time, total screen time and total sedentary time), physical activity, and height and weight, which were used to calculate BMI. For each socio-demographic variable, four single mediation models were conducted using two-level mixed-models regression analyses. Mediating effects were examined using the MacKinnon product-of-coefficients procedure and the Sobel test.

Preoperative localization studies are mandatory, and the use of a quick parathyroid hormone (PTH) assay is highly recommended. The aim of this study was to analyze our initial series of targeted parathyroidectomies. STUDY DESIGN: In a 2-year period, 50 patients underwent unilateral neck exploration for HPT under local anesthesia and light sedation. After biochemical diagnosis, a technetium 99m sestamibi scan was performed on all patients, and cervical ultrasonography was obtained in some patients. Frozen section analysis was used to confirm parathyroid tissue in all patients. There was no biochemical intraoperative evaluation of PTH. Demographics, surgical details, results, and complications were analyzed. RESULTS: There were 35 women and 15 men, with a mean age of 56 years (range 23 to 85 years). Mean preoperative calcium was 11.4 mg/dL (range 10.0 to 14.8 mg/dL), and PTH was 342 pg/mL (range 105 to 2,231 pg/mL). Mean surgical time was 52 minutes (range 30 to 100 minutes), and mean hospital stay was 2 days (range 1 to 7 days). Mean parathyroid weight was 1,000 mg (range 117 to 17,000 mg).

OBJECTIVES: To find a quantitative relationship between the number of receptor positive cells and markers of inflammation, and to compare the two groups of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. METHODS: A total of 36 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 17) and osteoarthritis (n = 19) were included, and receptor positive cells and cellular markers of synovial inflammation were quantified by immunohistochemistry and ELISA (interleukin 6 (IL6) and IL8). RESULTS: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis showed a higher degree of histologically determined inflammation compared with those with osteoarthritis. However, synovial density of gluco-corticoid receptor positive (GR+), androgen receptor positive (AR+), ERalpha+ and ERbeta+ cells were not different among patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. In patients with osteoarthritis, the density of GR+ cells positively correlated with the density of AR+, ERalpha+ and ERbeta+ cells (p = 0.007), which was not observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

In case of failure of such procedure though, hysterectomy will most often be proposed as a second line of treatment. The place of the repetition of an endometrial destruction procedure has not yet been evaluated. The aim of our study is to evaluate the efficiency and the satisfaction after two consecutive techniques of endometrial destruction in case of abnormal uterine bleeding or post-menopausal bleeding. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Nineteen patients presenting with recurring abnormal uterine bleeding after one procedure of endometrial destruction, underwent in our department, between 2004\u00a0and 2011, a second conservative endometrial procedure. RESULTS: No complication occurred during the repeated procedure. Sixteen of the nineteen patients (84.2\u00a0%) included answered a questionnaire.

MATERIAL: 31 patients with probable SVD (according to NINCDS-AIREN and T. Erkinjuntii's criteria) and mean age 72.3 yrs;(M--43%, F--57%) and 14 healthy control subjects with mean age of 72.3 yrs (M-57%, F-43%). According to the Mini Mental Scale Examination (MMSE) the SVD group was divided into two subgroups with mild and moderate dementia, their EEGs being recorded with a Medelec and Neuroscan 4.2 system. Visual EEG findings were classified with the use of eight-degree scale of pathological changes by the presence of slow waves. Then QEEGs were made. The following parameters were calculated: alpha/slow wave power ratios, the mean wave frequency in all and in some selected derivations. RESULTS: A significant difference was found between QEEGs in SVD subgroups with mild and moderate dementia (p<0.05), but there was no significant difference between visual EEGs.

This investigation chose to investigate one aspect of the restrictive role of gastric bypass: the pouch size. Our hypothesis was that a small pouch size with no fundus after laparoscopic RYGBP (LRYGBP) would lead to greater loss of excess weight and weight loss success. METHODS: Upper gastrointestinal radiological (UGI) studies were retrospectively reviewed by three blinded experts (2 bariatric surgeons and 1 expert radiologist), to determine pouch size and fundus size. The following grading system was utilized: Size I - smaller than average pouch, Size II - average pouch, Size III larger than average pouch, and Size IV - over 3 times the size of an average pouch. Fundus 0 - no fundus appreciated, Fundus I - slight amount of fundus barely noted, Fundus II - fundus noted, Fundus III - large amount of fundus noted, and Fundus IV - majority of the pouch was fundus. Percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) and successful weight loss (A.>50% EWL, B. within 50% of ideal body weight, C. loss of>25% of preoperative weight) were calculated.

This study sought to (i) estimate the costs of introducing pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, rotavirus vaccine and a second dose of measles vaccine in Zambia; and (ii) assess affordability of the new vaccines in relation to Gavi's co-financing and eligibility policies. METHODS: Data on 'one-time' costs of cold storage expansions, training and social mobilisation were collected from the government and development partners. A detailed economic cost study of routine immunisation based on a representative sample of 51 health facilities provided information on labour and vaccine transport costs. Gavi co-financing payments and immunisation programme costs were projected until 2022 when Zambia is expected to transition from Gavi support. The ability of Zambia to self-finance both new and traditional vaccines was assessed by comparing these with projected government health expenditures. RESULTS: 'One-time' costs of introducing the three vaccines amounted to US$ 0.28 per capita. The new vaccines increased annual immunisation programme costs by 38%, resulting in economic cost per fully immunised child of US$ 102. Co-financing payments on average increased by 10% during 2008-2017, but must increase 49% annually between 2017 and 2022. In 2014, the government spent approximately 6% of its health expenditures on immunisation. Assuming no real budget increases, immunisation would account for around 10% in 2022. Vaccine prices are competitive with other health interventions and the government is expected to be able to self-finance the new vaccines.",

Whether differences in cardiovascular disease risk factors across education or income levels have widened in the last decade remains an issue of considerable public health importance. METHODS: Analysis by mixed-regression models of trends in cardiovascular disease risk factors, in population-based samples (n = 3334 in 1980-1982, n = 4538 in 1985-1987, and n = 4517 in 1990-1992) of Minneapolis-St Paul residents 25 to 74 years old. RESULTS: Education level was inversely related to serum cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, smoking prevalence, and body mass index and positively related to leisure-time physical activity and health knowledge in both sexes. Household income was inversely associated with systolic blood pressure and body mass index in women and with smoking prevalence in both sexes. Income level was positively associated with leisure-time physical activity and health knowledge in both sexes.

The \"healthy migrant\" effect concerns the association between foreign born status per se and birth outcomes. The epidemiological paradox and healthy migrant effect were analysed for newborns in a favourable sociopolitical environment. METHODS: 98,330 live births to mothers in Montreal, Canada from 1997 to 2001 were analysed. Mothers were categorised as foreign born versus Canadian born. Outcomes were: small for gestational age (SGA) birth; low birth weight (LBW) and preterm birth (PTB). Multilevel logistic regression was used to examine the interaction between maternal education and foreign born status, adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: Not having a high school diploma was associated with LBW in Canadian (odds ratio (OR) 3.20; 95% CI 2.61 to 3.91) but not foreign born (OR 1.14; 95% CI 0.99 to 2.10) mothers and was more strongly associated with SGA birth in Canadian (OR 2.03; 95% CI 1.84 to 2.22) than in foreign born (OR 1.26; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.49) mothers.

OBJECTIVES: To determine national and state-specific population-based vaccine coverage rates among preschool children who participate in the WIC program, and to describe the strategies for promoting vaccination in WIC.DESIGN/ METHODS: Demographic data, WIC participation, and vaccination histories for children aged 24 to 35 months in 1999 were collected from parents through the National Immunization Survey. The healthcare providers for the children in the survey were contacted to verify and complete vaccination information. We defined children as up-to-date (UTD) if they had received four doses of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine (DPT), three doses of poliovirus vaccine, one dose of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR), and three doses of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (Hib) by 24 months. Description of state-level vaccination-promoting activities in WIC was collected through an annual survey completed by the state WIC and immunization program directors. RESULTS: Complete data were collected on 15,766 children, of whom 7783 (49%) participated in WIC sometime in their lives. Nationally, children who had ever participated in WIC were less well-immunized at 24 months compared to children who had not: 72.9% UTD (95% CI, 71.3-74.5) versus 80.8% UTD (95% CI, 79.5-82.1), respectively. In the 10 states with the highest WIC participation, the difference in vaccine coverage was even more pronounced: 68.2% UTD (95% CI, 66.2-70.2) versus 78.2% UTD (95% CI, 76.2-80.2). The difference in vaccine coverage between WIC participants and non-WIC participants was greatest for DPT (72.9% UTD versus 80.8% UTD, respectively), followed by MMR (72.9% UTD versus 78.2% UTD), Hib (72.9% UTD versus 76.2% UTD), and poliovirus (72.9% UTD versus 76.2% UTD). The most common reason for not being up-to-date was that the child had not received the vaccine (52.2%), followed by the parents' decision not to vaccinate (22.2%), and the child's health condition (15.6%).

Although increasingly used, we find that, in PD patients, abdominal computerized tomography (CT) is ineffective in determining significant pathology. This study was undertaken to assess the diagnostic utility of CT for the identification of intra-abdominal collections in PD patients presenting with peritonitis. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was undertaken of all patients that underwent abdominal CT scanning in the context of severe PD peritonitis in the past 2 years. All of these patients had at least one CT scan preoperatively. RESULTS: 133 patients presented with PD peritonitis; 19 patients had a contrast CT procedure (12 females, 7 males).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Time-and-motion study of resident physicians' note-writing practices using a commercial electronic health record system that includes an electronic documentation module. The study was conducted in the general medicine unit of a large academic hospital. RESULTS: During the study, 96 note-writing sessions by 11 resident physicians, resulting in close to 100 h of observations were seen. Seven of the 10 most common transitions between activities during note composition were between documenting, and gathering and reviewing patient data, and updating the plan of care. DISCUSSION: The high frequency of transitions seen in the study suggested that clinical documentation is fundamentally a synthesis activity, in which clinicians review available patient data and summarize their impressions and judgments. At the same time, most electronic health record systems are optimized to support documentation as uninterrupted composition. This mismatch leads to fragmentation in clinical work, and results in inefficiencies and workarounds. In contrast, we propose that documentation can be best supported with tools that facilitate data exploration and search for relevant information, selective reading and annotation, and composition of a note as a temporal structure.",

        "input": "OBJECTIVES: Cancer patients are at high risk for acute kidney injury (AKI), which is associated with high mortality when renal replacement therapy is required. Because physicians might be reluctant to offer dialysis to patients with malignancies, we sought to appraise outcomes in critically ill cancer patients (mainly with hematological malignancies) who received renal replacement therapy for AKI complicating cancer management. DESIGN: Cohort study including consecutive patients who received renal replacement therapy for AKI complicating cancer management, over a 42-month period. Their mortality was compared with that of non-cancer patients who received renal replacement therapy in the same center over the same study period (control group). SETTING: A 12-bed medical intensive care unit in a university hospital. RESULTS: 94 critically-ill cancer patients met the inclusion criteria. Median SAPS II was 53 (IQR 40-75) and median Logistic Organ Dysfunction score was 7 (IQR 5-10). The etiology of AKI was multiple in most patients (248 identified factors in 93 patients). Hospital mortality was 51.1%. Two variables were independently associated with hospital mortality: the severity of associated organ failures at ICU admission (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.11-1.59; per point) and renal function deterioration after ICU admission (OR, 5.42; 95% CI, 1.62-18.11). Characteristics of the malignancy were not associated with hospital mortality. The presence of cancer had no detectable influence on hospital mortality after adjustment for gender, age, acute severity as assessed by the SAPS II score, and chronic health status [OR 1.2, 95% CI 0.6-2.4].",

There has been some evidence that BNP and NT-proBNP can be used in the diagnosis of myocardial ischaemia by improving the sensitivity of exercise- stress testing. OBJECTIVE: To observe the relationship between dipyridamole- induced ischaemia and the secretion of NT-proBNP. METHODS: A total of 52 consecutive patients, referred for dipyridamole stress 99m Tc-sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) to diagnose reversible ischaemia, were enrolled. NT-proBNP was determined at rest and one hour after infusion of dipyridamole. RESULTS: Of the 52 patients, 25 had normal scans, 12 had scans with fixed defects (previous myocardial infarction with no inducible ischaemia) and 15 had reversible perfusion defects (inducible ischaemia). There was no correlation between ischaemia and resting NT-proBNP, post-stress NT-proBNP and the change in NT-proBNP.

The transcatheter closure of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), as well as other more complex pediatric interventions, have raised concerns regarding radiation exposure, particularly relevant when treating children. The purpose of this study is to show how to perform the transcatheter closure of PDA in children while giving less ionized radiation and to prove that the amount of radiation and contrast material can be reduced. STUDY DESIGN: Following appropriate device selection based on PDA morphology and diameter, transthorasic echocardiography images and control aortography findings were analyzed. The following devices were used during the procedure: Gianturco coils (10/63), an Amplatzer Duct Occluder (ADO, 31/63), Flipper coils (19/63), and an Amplatzer vascular plug (3/63). RESULTS: The scopy time, radiation dose, and contrast were 12 \u00b1 6.4 mins, 28.1 \u00b1 14.7 cmGy/cm\u00b2/kg, and 4.2 \u00b1 2.3 cc/kg, respectively. In the control aortography shortly after the procedure, residual shunt was detected at various levels in 39.7% of patients, and 9.5% demonstrated residual shunt in real-time echocardiography.

RESEARCH DESIGN: We induced PIT in the sensorimotor cortex in rats and examined the recovery of motor function using the beam-walking test. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: In 24 rats, the right sensorimotor cortex was lesioned after 2 days of training for the beam-walking test (group 1). After 10 days, PIT was induced in the left sensorimotor cortex. Eight additional rats (group 2) received 2 days training in beam walking, then underwent the beam-walking test to evaluate function. After 10 days of testing, the left sensorimotor cortex was lesioned and recovery was monitored by the beam-walking test for 8 days. MAIN OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: In group 1 animals, left hindlimb function caused by a right sensorimotor cortex lesion recovered within 10 days after the operation. Right hindlimb function caused by the left-side lesion recovered within 6 days. In group 2, right hindlimb function caused by induction of the left-side lesion after a total of 12 days of beam-walking training and testing recovered within 6 days as with the double PIT model.

Yet, some patients suffering from SAH have long-lasting cerebral vasospasm (LL-CVS, i.e., longer than 14 days). The outcome of these patients with a very long treatment is unknown. METHODS: Patients with SAH were entered into a prospectively collected database. In unconscious patients, CVS was treated until a reversal of CVS was confirmed by imaging. Outcome was assessed with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS; favorable [mRS 0-2] and unfavorable [mRS 3-6]) 6 months after SAH. Data were compared by matched pair analysis. RESULTS: Of 1126 patients, 106 had LL-CVS (9.4%). The mean of treatment was until day 20 (range, 15-42). Of these patients, more than 30% needed treatment longer than 21 days after SAH; 29% had a small intracerebral hematoma (ICH;<50 mL). Hydrocephalus that required external ventricular drainage was present in 81%. Outcomes were favorable in 60%, and 8% died. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, risk factors for an unfavorable outcome were elderly patients, poor admission status, and the presence of small ICH.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to validate any or all of the 8 clinical identifiers of early-stage primary/idiopathic adhesive capsulitis established in an earlier Delphi study. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study. METHODS: Sixty-four patients diagnosed with early-stage adhesive capsulitis by a physical therapist or medical practitioner were included in the study. Eight active and 8 passive shoulder movements and visual analog scale pain scores for each movement were recorded prior to and immediately following an intra-articular injection of corticosteroid and local anesthetic. Using the local anesthetic as the reference standard, pain relief of \u226570% for passive external rotation was deemed a positive anesthetic response (PAR). RESULTS: Sixteen participants (25%) demonstrated a PAR. Univariate logistic regression identified that of the proposed identifiers, global loss of passive range of movement (odds ratio [OR]=0.26, P=.03), pain at the end of range of all measured active movements (OR=0.06, P=.02), and global loss of passive glenohumeral movements (OR=0.23, P=.02) were associated with a PAR. Following stepwise removal of the variables, pain at the end of range of all measured active movements remained the only identifier but was associated with reduced odds of a PAR. LIMITATIONS: The lack of a recognized reference standard for diagnosing early-stage adhesive capsulitis remains problematic in all related research.",

All patients with myelomeningocele (MM) are radiographically tethered, and untethering procedures carry significant morbidity risks including worsening neurological function and wound complications. No guidelines exist as regards untethering in patients with MM prior to scoliosis correction surgery. The authors' aim in this study was to evaluate their experience in patients with MM who were not untethered before scoliosis correction. METHODS: Seventeen patients with MM were retrospectively identified and 1) had no evidence of a clinically symptomatic tethered cord, 2) had undergone spinal fusion for scoliosis correction, and 3) had not been untethered for at least 1 year prior to surgery. The minimum follow-up after fusion was 2 years. Charts and radiographs were reviewed for neurological or shunt complications in the perioperative period. RESULTS: The average age of the patients was 12.4 years, and the following neurological levels were affected: T-12 and above, 7 patients; L-1/L-2, 6 patients; L-3, 2 patients; and L-4, 2 patients. All were radiographically tethered as confirmed on MR imaging. Fourteen of the patients (82%) had a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. The mean Cobb angle was corrected from 82 degrees to 35 degrees , for a 57% correction.

Clinical demographics for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients were collected based on the Utstein style. Outcomes collected included ROSC for 20min, survival to admission, survival and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at 1 month. S100B protein was measured twice before starting CPR (first S100B) and immediately after ROSC (second S100B). We investigated the association between S100B protein levels and clinical outcomes using a multivariate logistic regression model. RESULTS: A total of 151 patients were included (age: 60.2+/-16.8 years, male: 64.2%). Of these, 60 (39.7%) had ROSC and 46 (30.5%) survived to admission.

Lack of information was a call to assess the effect of chronic consumption of Power Horse (PH) as one of the EDs, on the structure of pancreas and fundic mucosa of stomach in rats, and possible protective role of Omega-3. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty two adult male albino rats were divided equally into 4 groups; control received group which only received a standard diet, Omega-3 group, PH group which given PH and PH plus Omega-3 group received both PH plus Omega-3 for 4 weeks. Biochemical assessment of blood glucose, serum insulin, gastrin, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) was performed. The antioxidant activity and histopathological examination of both pancreatic tissue and fundic mucosa of stomach were assessed. RESULTS: Administration of PH significantly increased serum insulin and glucose levels while it significantly reduced serum gastrin level compared to control. PH also caused oxidants/antioxidants imbalance in both pancreas and fundic mucosa. The latter revealed degenerative changes and increased apoptosis which was evident by increased caspase-3 immunoexpression. Pancreas exhibited signs of \u03b2-cells overstimulation. Fundic mucosa showed reduced number of parietal cells, gastrin hormone expression compared to control group. Omega-3 administration could alleviate, to some extent, these changes.

Despite the availability of screening tools, there is a general consensus that PPD is under-diagnosed. A number of risk factors contributing to PPD have been investigated, but role of seasonal variability in PPD is unclear. Our purpose was to assess whether seasonal variation is another risk factor for PPD. METHODS: This cross-sectional pilot study was conducted at 2 family medicine clinics and an obstetrics/gynecology clinic over 24 months. During their postpartum visit, mothers who gave consent were asked to fill out a survey requesting demographic data, followed by the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS). The EPDS is a well-validated tool shown to be highly effective in detecting postnatal depression. A score>12 on the EPDS indicated a likely risk of PPD. RESULTS: Of the 556 patients approached, 530 completed the EPDS. Mean (+/-SE) patient age was 24.9 +/- 0.2 years; 71% were African Americans; 74% were single mothers; and 39% had at least some college education. On the EPDS, 17.8% scored>or =13.

        "input": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to examine the prospective annual risk of hemorrhage in patients harboring Spetzler-Martin grades IV and V arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) before and after initiation of treatment. METHODS: Medical records of 61 consecutive patients presenting with Spetzler-Martin grades IV and V AVMs were retrospectively reviewed for demographics, angiographic features, presenting symptom(s), and time of all hemorrhage events, before or after treatment initiation. Pretreatment hemorrhage rates (excluding hemorrhages at presentation) and posttreatment rates were subsequently calculated. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores before and after treatment were recorded. RESULTS: The annual pretreatment hemorrhage rate for all patients was 10.4% per year (95% CI, 2.2 to 15.4%), 13.9% (95% CI, 3.5 to 22.1%) in patients with hemorrhagic presentation and 7.3% (2.6 to 14.3%) in patients with nonhemorrhagic presentation. Posttreatment hemorrhage rates were 6.1% per year (95% CI, 2.5 to 13.2%) for all patients, 5.6% (95% CI, 2.1 to 11.8%) for patients presenting with hemorrhage and 6.4% (95% CI, 1.6 to 10.1%) in patients with nonhemorrhagic presentation. A noninferiority test showed that the posttreatment hemorrhage rate was less than or equal to the pretreatment hemorrhage rate (P<0.0001), with a 95% CI of 0.0001 to 0.0001. The mRS scores before and after treatment were 4.0 and 4.5, respectively (P<0.0001).",

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: Supported living in residential homes for the elderly is an innovative, age-appropriate residential program for older adults with chronic mental disorders. The program involves 1) accommodation in ordinary \"elder care\" homes; and 2) provision of on-site mental health care by professionals from the local psychiatric hospital. The authors asked whether the program succeeds in improving the patients' quality of life without compromising their mental stability. METHODS: Patients in 18 supported living programs (N=96) were compared with similar patients in eight psychiatric hospitals (N=78), in a cross-sectional study. Quality of life was measured with the Philadelphia Geriatric Center Morale Scale (PGCMS) and the Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life (MANSA). Mental stability was assessed in terms of rehospitalizations, adjustments in medication because of symptom exacerbation, and 6-month prevalence of psychotic symptoms. RESULTS: After adjustment for patient characteristics, the supported-living participants experienced a significantly lower quality of life than the hospital patients, as indicated by two of the three PGCMS subscales and by the MANSA. Disparities were greatest in the subgroup of patients with psychotic disorders. No significant differences in mental stability were found between the two conditions. Eleven of the 96 supported-living participants had undergone temporary rehospitalization since their entry into the program.",

Physicians chose therapy for inadequately compensated patients at their own discretion, with 4\u202f972 patients included.AIM: The study aimed at the assessment of the differences in basic anthropometric and biochemical parameters between the patient cohorts included in the PROROK project with regard to the therapy selected by the treating diabetologist. METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS: The patients treated with GLP1 receptor agonists were quite young, they have suffered from diabetes for a shorter period of time and at the same time were more obese and had the highest concentration of triacylglycerols. The patients who underwent basal insulin therapy, had the highest fasting glycemia. The patients for whom premixed insulin therapy or basal/bolus insulin regimen were chosen, manifested the highest postprandial glycemia, those with basal/bolus insulin regimen had the highest initial glycated haemoglobin. The difference between fasting and postprandial glycemia was the smallest in the cohort for which basal insulin therapy was chosen and the greatest in the cohort chosen for the therapy with premixed insulin, or with the basal/bolus insulin combination. Average improvement in glycated haemoglobin was the highest in the cohort for which GLP1 receptor agonist therapy was chosen.",

The purpose of this study was to assess the isometric (IT) and peak torque (PT) of the muscles responsible for shin rotation in patients after ACLR with an ST or with an STGR graft. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty patients with an ST graft and 20 patients with a combined STGR graft underwent a 6-month postoperative rehabilitation program after ACLR. At the end of the rehabilitation program, the IT and PT of the muscles responsible for internal (IR) and external rotation (ER) of the shin were measured. The results were compared to the results of a control group. Additionally, to determine the reliability of the dynamometer for clinical research, a test-retest assessment was performed. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the 3 groups of participants.

DESIGN: Randomized control trial. SETTING: Accredited teaching practices of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners' Training Program. SUBJECTS: Thirty-four trainees and 1,500 consecutive adult patients ages 16-65 years. METHOD: Trainees randomly allocated to the experimental group participated in a 3-day interactive workshop on disease prevention during their 13-week family medicine term. Audiotapes of consultations with adults conducted by trainees at the beginning and end of the rotation were analyzed blind to compare assessment of patients' smoking status and, for women, date of last Pap smear. A questionnaire mailed to each patient after the consultation also allowed identification of smokers and women overdue for a smear. Consultations with these patients at risk were analyzed for preventive counseling. Inter- and intrarater reliability was calculated for audiotape analysis. RESULTS: Preworkshop rates of questions about smoking were low, occurring in 22% of consultations. While trainees allocated to the experimental workshop were more likely to ask a routine question about smoking at the end of the term than those in the control group (P = 0.01), two-thirds of smokers remained undetected irrespective of trainee group and fewer than one in five were advised to stop smoking. Reminders about Pap smears did not change as a result of training and remained low in fewer than 20% of consultations. kappa values demonstrated high reliability of audiotape analysis.",

We estimated the cost-effectiveness of a 10-year federal program to promote influenza vaccine, intended to increase vaccination rates among persons>or = 65 years old. METHODS: Published estimates regarding influenza-associated mortality rates and vaccine efficacy among the US elderly were used to calculate the number needed to vaccinate (NNV) to prevent one all-cause death due to influenza, as well as the mortality reduction expected from increased vaccination rates. The costs per life-year saved were estimated for a hypothetical federal promotional campaign, patterned after a direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising program (2006-2015). The base case scenario presumed a 25-percentage-point increase in vaccination rates to 90%; in sensitivity analyses, we examined programs that increased rates by 10-20 points. RESULTS: The base case NNV was 1116 (95% CI: 993-1348). Over the 10-year DTC-style influenza vaccine promotion program, 6516 (5576-7435) elderly lives would be saved.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether pain tends to radiate into the longer or shorter leg in patients with a lumbar herniated disc. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: No previous studies have investigated the association between leg length discrepancy and side of radiating pain in patients with a herniated disc. Results of studies of low back pain with radiation and leg length discrepancy are inconsistent concerning this association. METHODS: Of 132 consecutive patients admitted to a district hospital for surgical management of a lumbar herniated disc, leg length discrepancy was assessed using the indirect method as described by Calliet. RESULTS: Seventy-three patients (55%) were men, and 59 (45%) were women. The mean age was 40 years, and 99% of all herniated discs appeared at L4-L5 (n = 60) or L5-S1 (n = 71). In 64 (62%) of the 104 patients with a leg length discrepancy of 1 mm or more, the pain radiated in the shorter leg (P = 0.02). In subgroups of patients with larger leg length discrepancies, similar results were found but because of smaller sample sizes, these findings did not each statistical significance. In 32 of the 57 men (56.1%), the pain radiated to the shorter leg (P = 0.43); this was observed in 33 of the 47 women (70.2%; P = 0.01).",

Patients were evaluated in two groups depending on the presence or absence of MetS. Age- and gender-matched 20 healthy subjects (9 males, 11 females; mean age 50+/-5 years) comprised the control group. The diagnosis of MetS was based on the presence of at least three of five MetS criteria. Hypertension was defined as arterial blood pressure exceeding 140/85 mmHg on three consecutive measurements or the use of antihypertensive drugs. Echocardiographic measurements included interventricular septal thickness, left ventricular internal diameter, posterior wall thickness, aortic diameter, left atrial diameter, relative wall thickness, and left ventricular mass. RESULTS: Metabolic syndrome was present in 32 hypertensive patients (42.7%; 18 males, 14 females). The mean number of MetS criteria was 2.6+/-1.0 in the hypertensive group. Compared to the control group, patients with or without MetS exhibited significantly increased interventricular septum and posterior wall thickness, left atrial diameter, relative wall thickness, and left ventricular mass (p<0.05).

Defining what constitutes professional behavior is the first step in this endeavor. Difficulty in teaching and evaluating professionalism may stem from generational differences between teachers and trainees in their definition of professional behavior. PURPOSE: We sought to explore the magnitude of generational differences by asking faculty and residents to evaluate behaviors along a continuum of professionalism. METHODS: A questionnaire composed of 16 vignettes describing unprofessional behaviors was distributed to a sample of internal medicine trainees and faculty. For each specific behavior described, participants were asked to rate the severity of the infraction on a 4-point scale. RESULTS: Within each group, responses were distributed across severity categories for most vignettes. There were no significant differences in the responses of trainees versus faculty for any of the vignettes except two.",

METHOD: The standard error of a difference between a statistic calculated for a subgroup and for the whole population was derived theoretically both ignoring and allowing for overlap. The ratio of these standard errors was defined as the correction factor. Cancer incidence and death data (1997-2001) for the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW) were examined to demonstrate the utility of the correction factor. RESULTS: If the overlap is ignored, significance tests are conservative and confidence intervals too wide.

At enhanced plant Zn uptake, grain Zn levels do not increase proportionally and within the grain the endosperm Zn levels remain below grain Zn levels. This study analysed the temporal dynamics of Zn concentrations in grain tissues during grain filling to find major bottlenecks. METHODS: Plants of two cultivars were grown at 1 and 5 mg Zn kg(-1) soil. Individual panicles were harvested 7, 14, 24 or 34 d after their flowering or at maturity and seeds were dissected into constituting tissues, which were analysed for Zn and other minerals. KEY RESULTS: The Zn concentration of the crease was found to increase five- to nine-fold between 7 and 34 d after anthesis, while that of the endosperm decreased by 7 and 45 % when grown at 1 or 5 mg Zn kg(-1), respectively. The Zn turnover rate (d(-1)) in the crease tissues was either independent of the Zn application level or higher at the lower Zn application level, and the Zn concentration increased in the crease tissues with time during grain filling while the turnover rate gradually decreased.",

Research teams visited each of these communities every two years since 1996 and conducted between 50 to 90 semistructured interviews. Additional information on hospital competition and strategy was gathered from secondary data. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We found that hospitals' strategic emphasis changed significantly between 1996-1997 and 2000-2001. In the mid-1990s, hospitals primarily competed on price through \"wholesale\" strategies (i.e., providing services attractive to managed care plans). By 2000-2001, nonprice competition was becoming increasingly important and hospitals were reviving \"retail\" strategies (i.e., providing services attractive to individual physicians and the patients they serve). Three major factors explain this shift in hospital strategy: less than anticipated selective contracting and capitated payment; the freeing up of hospital resources previously devoted to horizontal and vertical integration strategies; and, the emergence and growth of new competitors.",

METHODS: We analyzed the data of 2385 consecutive patients referred to our hypertension clinic for the performance of ABPM. Before ambulatory monitoring was performed, a nurse-measured BP was obtained three times using a Y-tube connecting the sphygmomanometer and the recorder. We compared the mean value of the three nurse-measured blood pressures with that of the 12h daytime ambulatory monitoring, considered as the reference. RESULTS: The difference between the nurse-measured and the ambulatory blood pressure was small but statistically significant, indicating that nurse-measured blood pressure tends to overestimate both diastolic and systolic blood pressure. The difference between the nurse blood pressure and ABPM was greater among treated hypertensive patients than untreated patients. To diagnose hypertension, defined as a blood pressure of over 140/90mmHg by ABPM, the positive predictive value of the nurse blood pressure was 0.81 and the negative predictive value 0.63. However, these predictive values could be improved with less stringent cut-off values of blood pressure. Thus, for a diastolic blood pressure above 100mmHg, the positive predictive value of nurse blood pressure was 0.55 and the negative predictive value 0.91. These figures were relatively similar for previously treated and untreated patients.",

METHODS: Based on AHI results, 22 non-OSAS and 68 OSAS cases were followed up. Among the 68 patients, 5 underwent surgery, 2 were treated with oral appliances, 33 were treated using continuous positive airway pressure and 28 were untreated. AHI, anthropometric parameters, serum and EBC levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and 8-isoprostane were measured at baseline and after a 2-month follow-up. Correlations between the AHI and the other parameters were examined. Akaike's information criterion (AIC) was used to evaluate the fit of logistic regression models, predicting improvements in the severity of the condition from the parameters.

METHODS: Between January 1995 and February 1997 a prospective randomized trial was conducted for patients without stomas who underwent anorectal reconstructive surgery. All patients were randomly assigned either to medical bowel confinement (a clear liquid diet with loperamide 4 mg by mouth three times per day and codeine phosphate 30 mg by mouth four times per day until the third postoperative day) or to a regular diet, beginning the day of surgery. All patients in both groups underwent the identical preoperative oral mechanical preparation, preoperative oral and parenteral antibiotics, and postoperative antibiotics. Wound closure and wound care were identical in both groups. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients (46 females) were prospectively, randomly assigned to medical bowel confinement (n = 27; 50 percent) or a regular diet (n = 27; 50 percent); the mean ages were 51.0 (range, 28-80) and 47.2 (range, 23-87) years, respectively. Indications for surgery were fecal incontinence in 32 patients, complicated fistulas in 17 patients, anal stenosis in 4 patients, a Whitehead deformity in 1 patient, and a chronic unhealed fissure in 1 patient.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Policymakers have proposed risk-adjusted bundled payment as the single most promising method of linking reimbursement to value rather than to quantity of service. Our objective was to assess the relationship between risk and cost to develop a model for forecasting the costs of cardiac operations under a bundled payment scheme. METHODS: All patients undergoing adult cardiac operations for which there was a Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) risk score over a 5-year period (2008 to 2013) at a tertiary care, university hospital were reviewed. Patients were stratified into five groups based on preoperative risk as a basis for negotiating risk-adjusted bundles. A multivariable regression model was developed to analyze the relationship between risk and log-transformed costs. Monte Carlo simulation was performed to validate the model by comparing predicted with actual fiscal year 2013 costs. RESULTS: Among the 2,514 patients analyzed, preoperative risk was strongly correlated with costs (p<0.001) but was able to explain only 28% (R(2) = 0.28) of the variation in costs between individual patients. The use of bundling to diffuse and adjust for risk improved prediction to only 33% (R(2) = 0.33). Actual costs in 2013 were $21.6M compared with predicted costs of $19.3M (\u00b1$350K), which is well outside the forecast's 95% confidence interval.",

Although some studies have examined the interest of inducing labor for fetuses with macrosomia suspected in utero, only a few have analyzed this suspected macrosomia according to estimated weight at each gestational age. Most studies have focused principally on neonatal rather than on maternal (and still less on perineal) outcomes. The principal aim of this study was to assess whether a policy of induction of labor for women with a constitutionally large-for-gestational-age fetus might reduce the occurrence of severe perineal tears; the secondary aims of this work were to assess whether this policy would reduce either recourse to cesarean delivery during labor or neonatal complications.

Among the pregnancies with fetuses suspected, before birth, of being large-for-gestational-age, we compared those for whom labor was induced from\u2009\u2265\u200937\u00a0weeks to\u2009\u2264\u200938\u00a0weeks+ 6 days (n\u2009=\u2009199) to those with expectant obstetrical management (n\u2009=\u20092878). In this intention-to-treat analysis, results were expressed as crude and adjusted relative risks. RESULTS: The mean birth weight was 4012\u00a0g\u2009\u00b1\u2009421\u00a0g. The rate of perineal lesions did not differ between the two groups in either primiparas (aRR: 1.06; 95% CI: 0.86-1.30) or multiparas (aRR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.82-1.28). The rate of cesarean delivery was also similar in the two groups (aRR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.82-1.28). The rate of neonatal complications was also similar in the two groups (aRR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.82-1.28).",

This mixed methods study explored gender differences in severity of emotional distress, referral paths, presenting problems and care expectations among service users upon accessing outpatient psychiatric care. METHODS: Consecutive service users (N=284, 64% women) who presented for a new or repeated episode of care in adult outpatient clinics completed questionnaires on a measure of emotional distress, treatment history and referral path. These variables were quantitatively analyzed. Also, users completed two open-ended questionnaires on reasons for seeking care and expectations from the services. These variables were qualitatively analyzed using thematic analyses. RESULTS: No significant gender differences emerged on any of the variables examined among new and repeated users. The main reasons for seeking care were psychiatric symptoms as well as non-specific psychopathology. The most frequent expectations from the services were receiving psychotherapy and specific tools to better manage life problems. LIMITATIONS: The sample of new male service users was relatively small.",

DESIGN: Retrospective data analysis examining colon resections determined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification classification performed in the United States from 2001 through 2005 using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) and the Area Resource File (2004). Patient covariates used in adjustment included age, sex, race, Charlson Index comorbidity score, and insurance status. Hospital covariates included TH status, presence of a colorectal surgery fellowship approved by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, geographical region, institutional volume, and urban vs rural location. County-specific surgeon characteristics used in adjustment included average age of surgeons and proportion of colorectal board-certified surgeons within each county. Environmental or county covariates included median income and percentage of county residents living below the federal poverty level. SETTING: A total of 1045 hospitals located in 38 states in the United States that were included in the NIS. PATIENTS: All patients older than 18 years who had colon resection and were discharged from a hospital included in the NIS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Operative mortality, length of stay (LOS), and total charges. RESULTS: A total of 115 250 patients were identified, of whom 4371 died (3.8%). The mean LOS was 10 days. Fewer patients underwent surgical resection in THs than in non-THs (46 656 vs 68 589). Teaching hospitals had a lower operative mortality rate (2.8% vs 3.2%) and a shorter LOS (9.2 days vs 10.2 days) than non-THs. After adjusting for patient and hospital covariates, TH status was not associated with operative mortality (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.92-1.07).

The use of MRI in assessing extent of disease for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is less well defined. This study assessed the value of MRI in the preoperative evaluation of DCIS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 98 patients with DCIS in 2007. Of these, 63 underwent stereotactic biopsy, followed by MRI. There were 35 who underwent stereotactic biopsy alone. Concordance between MRI and histopathology was defined as the presence or absence of residual disease. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in mastectomy rates between the MRI and non-MRI group (20.3% vs 25.7%, P = .62). In patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery (BCS), there were fewer positive margins in the MRI versus the non-MRI group (21.2% vs 30.8%, P = .41). Of the 64 cases that underwent preoperative MRI, 43 (67.2%) were concordant. Also, 15 of 43 cases (34.8%) had MRI results that accurately predicted pathologic size.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Clinical guidelines recommend offering patients options for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, but the modalities vary by frequency, accuracy, preparations, discomfort, and cost, which may cause confusion and reduce screening rates. We examined whether patients reported confusion about the options and whether confusion was associated with socio-demographic characteristics, number of options discussed, and adherence. METHODS: Patients ages 50 to 75 years who had visited a clinician within 2 years were randomly selected for a cross-sectional study (n = 6,100). A questionnaire mailed in 2007 asked the following: whether a clinician had ever discussed CRC screening options; which of four recommended tests (i.e., fecal occult blood testing, flexible sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, and barium enema) were presented; and whether the options were confusing. Analyses were restricted to respondents who reported discussing one or more screening options (n = 1,707). Weighted frequencies were calculated and multivariate logistic regression was done. RESULTS: The sample was 55.5% female, 15.6% African American, and 83.2% adherent to screening recommendations, and 56.0% had discussed two or more screening options. In adjusted analyses, nonadherent patients reported greater confusion than adherent patients (P<0.01). Adults who discussed two or more options were 1.6 times more likely to be confused than those who discussed one option [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.08-2.26]. Patients who reported being confused were 1.8 times more likely to be nonadherent to screening than those who did not (95% CI, 1.14-2.75).",

        "input": "PURPOSE: Historically, complication rates after colorectal surgery have been stratified by disease process, type of operation, or anesthesia risk derived after an intensive review of the medical record. Newer computer applications purport to shorten this process and predict the probability of postoperative complications by distinguishing them from comorbidities that are commingled on uniform discharge codes. We analyzed CaduCIS software, which uses discharge codes, to determine whether its predictions of comorbidity and complications were comparable to what was interpreted on the medical record. METHODS: Two-hundred seventy patients were analyzed according to the principal and secondary diagnoses coded on discharge. Coding inaccuracies of clinical occurrences were identified by physician review of each medical record. The actual incidences of 17 common preoperative comorbidities and 11 postoperative complications were compared with those predicted by CaduCIS. RESULTS: The CaduCIS-predicted distribution of comorbidities was similar to the actual occurrences in 15 of 17 categories. The overall incidence of complications obtained by physician (actual) review was 47 percent, compared with 46 percent predicted by CaduCIS. However, there was a statistical difference between the CaduCIS-predicted and the actual complication rates in 5 of the 11 categories. The most common preoperative comorbidity and complication was cardiopulmonary (47 percent and 28 percent, respectively).",

As most patients present with locally advanced disease, the possibility of radical surgery is limited. Consequently, radiotherapy is often needed as monotherapy or as an adjunct to surgery. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1977 and 1996, 73 patients (50 male: 23 female) with a paranasal sinus carcinoma were treated. The histology distribution was as follows: squamous cell carcinoma, 55%; adenocarcinoma, 19%; adenoid cystic carcinoma, 11%; and undifferentiated carcinoma, 15%. The clinical T classification was (UICC/TNM 1997): T2 14%, T3 27%, and T4 59%. Pathological neck nodes were found in 11% of patients. Treatment consisted of surgery only in 3, chemotherapy only in 1, radiotherapy only in 18, both surgery and radiotherapy in 50 patients. One patient did not receive any treatment at all. Three patients had concurrent chemotherapy. Median follow-up was 66 months (range, 1-213 months). RESULTS: Five-year local control (LC) was 65% with combination of radiotherapy and debulking surgery in comparison with 47% with radiotherapy alone, but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.58). However, combination treatment gave significantly better 5-year overall survival (OS) (60% vs. 9%; p = 0.001) and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) (53% vs. 6%; p<0. 0001).",

METHODS: In 4 month intervals we followed a cohort of 490 PLWHA for 12 months. We conducted hierarchical linear regression models to examine changes in safer sex self-efficacy when participants received zero, low to moderate (5-131 min) and high (132-320 min) doses of MI time. We conducted a similar analysis using number of counseling sessions as the predictor variable. RESULTS: Participants with low to moderate doses of MI counseling had 0.26 higher self-efficacy scores than participants with zero MI time (p=0.01). Also, they had 0.26 lower self-efficacy scores than participants with high amounts of MI time (p=0.04). Participants with high doses of MI had a 0.5 higher self-efficacy score than participants with zero amount of MI time (p<0.0001). Participants who received 3-4 counseling sessions had 0.41 greater self-efficacy scores than participants who did not receive any sessions (p<0.0001) but did not differ from participants receiving 1-2 sessions.",

Screening that begins with a treponemal test identifies persons with positive treponemal and negative nontreponemal test results who were missed when screening began with a nontreponemal test. The significance of these results is uncertain. We wondered if mothers with persistently negative nontreponemal test results could transmit syphilis to their newborns. METHODS: We reviewed congenital syphilis cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to identify all instances where (1) the mother had persistently negative nontreponemal test results (best evidence would be multiple negative nontreponemal test results with at least one>30 days after birth) and (2) the child had evidence of infection (best evidence a confirmed case, older child, stillbirth, or \"probable\" by the criteria of Kaufman et al.). RESULTS: A total of 23,863 patients with congenital syphilis had birthdates between 1991 and 2009. Of 106 mothers initially classified as having only negative nontreponemal test results reported, 20 were misclassified; the remaining 86 mothers had no infants with confirmed syphilis and no syphilitic stillbirths. The 23,757 other mothers had 284 (1.2%) infants with confirmed syphilis and 1271 (5.4%) syphilitic stillbirths. Twelve of the 86 mothers had negative nontreponemal test results more than 30 days after delivery; none of their children had convincing evidence of infection.

The aims of this study were to assess the requirement for subsequent cholecystectomy for gallbladder-related symptoms, and to identify the patients who develop symptoms after the endoscopic removal of CBD stones. METHODS: Of 241 patients with gallbladder in situ following endoscopic removal of stones from the CBD, 146 patients (78 men and 68 women; mean age 69 +/- 13 years, range 20-93) with a follow-up time of more than three months without elective cholecystectomy were enrolled in the study. Fifty-nine patients had gallbladder stones (single stones in 27 and multiple stones in 32) and 87 patients had gallbladder in situ without stones. The time from entry to the occurrences of death or cholecystectomy was evaluated retrospectively. Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the risk factors associated with these events. RESULTS: The mean duration of follow-up was 24.1 +/- 18.0 months (range 3-70 months). During follow-up, seven patients (4.8%) underwent cholecystectomy, on average 18.4 months after CBD stone removal, as the result of acute cholecystitis in four cases, biliary pain in two cases and acute pancreatitis in one case. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed in four patients and open cholecystectomy in three patients. Post-operative morbidity occurred in two patients, with improvement after conservative management. Nine patients (6.2%) died as the result of unrelated causes. The risk factors for cholecystectomy were gallbladder stones (hazard ratio 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2-4.0, p = 0.014), gallbladder in situ without stones (hazard ratio 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2-4.0, p = 0.014) and age (hazard ratio 1.0, 95% confidence interval 1.0-1.0, p = 0.001).",

        "input": "AIMS: Left main stenting is increasingly performed and often involves deployment of a single stent across vessels with marked disparity in diameters. Knowing stent expansion capacity is critical to ensure adequate strut apposition after post-dilatation of the stent has been performed. Coronary stents are usually manufactured in only two or three different model designs with each design having a different maximal expansion capacity. Information about the different workhorse designs and their maximal achievable diameter is not commonly provided by manufacturers but, in the absence of this critically important information, stents implanted in segments with major changes in vessel diameter have the potential to become grossly overstretched and to remain incompletely apposed. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the differences in workhorse designs of six commercially available drug-eluting stents (DES): the PROMUS Element, Taxus Libert\u00e9, XIENCE Prime, Resolute Integrity, BioMatrix Flex and Cypher Select stents. Using micro-computed tomography, we tested oversizing capabilities above nominal pressures for the different workhorse designs of the six DES using 4.0, 5.0 and 6.0 mm post-dilatation balloons inflated to 14 atmospheres. MLD could be increased significantly in all stents, only restricted by workhorse design limitations. Minimal inner lumen diameter (MLD) achieved after two successive 6.0 mm post-dilatations of the largest design (4.0 mm stent) was 5.7 mm for the Element, 5.6 mm for the XIENCE Prime, 6.0 mm for the Taxus, 5.4 mm for the Resolute Integrity, 5.9 mm for the BioMatrix and 5.8 mm for the Cypher stent. Significant deformations were observed during stent oversizing with large changes in terms of cell opening and crowns.",

It is unclear whether elderly individuals benefit from these interventions to the same extent as younger patients. We sought to determine whether the reduction in mortality or institutionalization seen with organized stroke care was similar across all age groups. METHODS: This was a case-cohort study of patients with acute ischemic stroke seen between July 2003 and March 2005 and captured in the Registry of the Canadian Stroke Network. After stratifying by age category, we assessed for evidence of effect modification by age on the reduction in stroke fatality associated with stroke unit/organized care. RESULTS: Among 3631 patients with ischemic stroke, stroke case-fatality at 30 days was lower for patients admitted to a stroke unit compared with those admitted to general medical wards (10.2% versus 14.8%; P<0.0001 with an absolute risk reduction=4.6%, number needed to treat=22). All age groups achieved a similar benefit of stroke unit care versus general medical ward care (absolute risk reduction for 30-day stroke fatality was 4.5% for<60 years; 3.4% for 60 to 69 years; 5.3% for 70 to 79 years; and 5.5% for those>80 years).

However, these techniques are unreliable with dysmorphic upper sacral segments, U-fractures, osseous compression of neural elements, and previously failed fixation. Lumbopelvic fixation can potentially address these injuries but is a technically demanding procedure requiring spinal and pelvic fixation and it is unclear whether it reliably corrects the deformity and restores function.QUESTIONS/ PURPOSES: We therefore assessed reduction quality and loss of fixation, pain related to prominent hardware, subjective dysfunction measured by the Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA), and complications. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 15 patients with unstable sacral fractures treated with lumbopelvic fixation between 2002 and 2010. Patients had radiographic monitoring regarding reduction quality and loss of fixation and clinical followup using the SMFA. The minimum followup was 12 months (mean, 23 months; range, 12-41 months). RESULTS: Posterior reduction quality was 11 of 15 with less than 5 mm persistent displacement and four of 15 with 5 to 10 mm displacement. Loss of fixation was observed in one patient as a result of a technical error. Prominent hardware resulted in greater pain.

In contrast, for humans, MNS is a Western norm and standard medical practice. However, the physiological impact of this is unknown. The physiological stress-response is orchestrated by the autonomic nervous system and heart rate variability (HRV) is a means of quantifying autonomic nervous system activity. Heart rate variability is influenced by level of arousal, which can be accurately quantified during sleep. Sleep is also essential for optimal early brain development. METHODS: To investigate the impact of MNS in humans, we measured HRV in 16 2-day-old full-term neonates sleeping in skin-to-skin contact with their mothers and sleeping alone, for 1 hour in each place, before discharge from hospital. Infant behavior was observed continuously and manually recorded according to a validated scale. Cardiac interbeat intervals and continuous electrocardiogram were recorded using two independent devices. Heart rate variability (taken only from sleep states to control for level of arousal) was analyzed in the frequency domain using a wavelet method. RESULTS: Results show a 176% increase in autonomic activity and an 86% decrease in quiet sleep duration during MNS compared with skin-to-skin contact.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: As annual crops develop, transpirational water loss increases substantially. This increase has to be matched by an increase in water uptake through the root system. The aim of this study was to assess the contributions of changes in intrinsic root hydraulic conductivity (Lp, water uptake per unit root surface area, driving force and time), driving force and root surface area to developmental increases in root water uptake. METHODS: Hydroponically grown barley plants were analysed during four windows of their vegetative stage of development, when they were 9-13, 14-18, 19-23 and 24-28 d old. Hydraulic conductivity was determined for individual roots (Lp) and for entire root systems (Lp(r)). Osmotic Lp of individual seminal and adventitious roots and osmotic Lp(r) of the root system were determined in exudation experiments. Hydrostatic Lp of individual roots was determined by root pressure probe analyses, and hydrostatic Lp(r) of the root system was derived from analyses of transpiring plants. KEY RESULTS: Although osmotic and hydrostatic Lp and Lp(r) values increased initially during development and were correlated positively with plant transpiration rate, their overall developmental increases (about 2-fold) were small compared with increases in transpirational water loss and root surface area (about 10- to 40-fold). The water potential gradient driving water uptake in transpiring plants more than doubled during development, and potentially contributed to the increases in plant water flow. Osmotic Lp(r) of entire root systems and hydrostatic Lp(r) of transpiring plants were similar, suggesting that the main radial transport path in roots was the cell-to-cell path at all developmental stages.",

METHODS: The present study included 72 patients who had been treated surgically for potentially resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma and 42 patients who had been treated surgically for palliation (bypass surgery) at our institution. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma was histologically confirmed by pathological examination of the resected specimen or, if unresected, by intraoperative biopsy. RESULTS: For resectable disease, the mean and median values of CA19-9 were significantly lower than for R1/2 or unresectable disease. The best cut-off points for CEA, CA19-9, and tumor size to predict resectability were 2.47 ng/mL, 92.77 U/mL and 11.85 cm(3), respectively. A CA19-9>or = 92.77 U/mL and both tumor markers no less than the cut-off levels predicted the possibility of R1/2 or unresectability with 90.6% and 88.6% accuracy, respectively. However, either tumor marker or both tumor markers less than the cut-off levels predicted the probability of R0 resection only with 27.1% and 40.6% accuracy, respectively. The independent contributing factors to resectability (R0 resection) by multivariate regression analysis were a CA 19-9<92.77 U/mL, a tumor size<11.85 cm(3), and a CEA<2.47 ng/mL.",

Several studies have reported that CCBs reduce the ability of clopidogrel to inhibit platelet aggregability; one suggested that CCBs reduce the efficacy of clopidogrel. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a post hoc analysis of the Clopidogrel for the Reduction of Events During Observation (CREDO) study to compare the treatment effect of clopidogrel in patients on CCBs versus not on CCBs. In CREDO, 2116 patients were randomly assigned to pretreatment with 300 mg clopidogrel 3-24 hours before a planned percutaneous coronary intervention followed by 1 year of 75 mg/d clopidogrel, versus 75 mg clopidogrel at the time of the procedure and continued for 28 days only. The primary end points were a combined end point of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke at 28 days and 1 year. Among the 580 patients (27%) on CCBs at enrollment, at 28 days, the combined end point was reached in 17 patients (6%) on clopidogrel versus 28 (9%) on placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39-1.29).

Our objectives in this study were to characterize patients \u2265 65 years old with femoral fractures (subtrochanteric/diaphyseal) considered typical and atypical and the relationship between the occurrence of atypical fractures and bisphosphonate use. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a case-control study with patients admitted in our hospital with subtrochanteric or diaphyseal femur fracture in a period of five and a half years. After applying the exclusion criteria, the 92 fractures (91 patients) were classified as typical or atypical. The determination of prior bisphosphonate treatment was obtained through consultation of the individual medical history. RESULTS: We found 11 atypical fractures (10 patients) and 81 typical fractures (81 patients). The median age of both groups was statistically different (72 years - atypical vs. 80 years - typical, p&lt; 0.01). The reason for the use of bisphosphonates was 0.60 in atypical fractures and 0.01 in typical, and an odds ratio of 101.1 was obtained (p&lt; 0.01).

We, therefore, studied 265 patients operated under regional anaesthesia to assess the incidence and the pathogenesis of per- and postoperative neurologic disorders and their relationship. METHOD: Neurologic function was adequately assessed in 261 patients during surgery. The operation was uneventful in 234 patients, while 27 suffered from transient ischaemic neurologic deficit occurring mainly during carotid artery clamping. RESULTS: Postoperative neurologic complications occurred in 6 (2.5%) of the patients who were symptom-free during surgery and in 1 (3.7%) of the patients who experienced neurologic deficit during surgery (NS). In this group, two additional patients had peroperative neurologic deficit which lasted a few hours postoperatively so that the total incidence of postoperative neurologic deficit (11.1%) was significantly higher than in the other group (P<0.05).

To the authors' knowledge, there is only limited evidence to support this belief. METHODS: For 5055 women in the Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance (ASCUS)-Low Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (LSIL) Triage Study (ALTS), the Pap interval was defined as the number of days between the referral Pap smear demonstrating ASCUS or LSIL (\"first cytology\") and the enrollment liquid-based (\"repeat\") cytology. The authors investigated the influence of the interval between Pap smears on repeat cytology by examining percentages of abnormal findings, cellularity, and test sensitivity among women diagnosed with histologic grade 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN3) during the 2-year course of the ALTS. In addition, because human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA adjunct testing is now performed, the authors evaluated HPV viral load, which was assayed using residual liquid cytology specimens, in women with CIN3. RESULTS: The Pap interval ranged from 8-30 days in 763 women, 31-60 days in 2317 women, 61-90 days in 1090 women, 91-120 days in 491 women, and 121-184 days in 394 women (mean of 61.3 days; standard deviation of 34 days). Repeat cytologic interpretations of unsatisfactory findings, ASCUS, and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) did not appear to vary among the Pap interval groups.

We present our operative results regarding mortality and morbidity after such combined surgery. As a comparison, our operative results after mitral valve repair in patients without chronic atrial fibrillation are presented. METHODS: Between April 1993 and December 1994, 39 patients with chronic atrial fibrillation underwent mitral valve repair and concomitant maze procedure (group 1) at the Iwate Medical University. During the same period, 36 patients with sinus rhythm and one patient with DDD pacemaker underwent mitral valve repair (group 2). In order to evaluate the operative risk, morbidity, and mortality of adding the maze procedure to mitral valve repair, total cardiopulmonary bypass time, aortic cross-clamp time, intraoperative blood loss, intubation period, and duration of ICU stay were compared between the groups. RESULTS: Total cardiopulmonary bypass time and aortic cross-clamp time in group 1 were longer than in group 2 (174.0 +/- 38.8 min versus 150.1 +/- 54.4 min; p = 0.032, 122.5 +/- 30.7 min versus 95.8 +/- 38.2 min; p = 0.0012).

The rule requires assessment of body composition before the competitive season to minimize unhealthy weight-loss practices. Leg-to-leg bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) has been suggested for use with wrestlers. PURPOSE: To evaluate leg-to-leg BIA against a four-component (4C) criterion to determine whether leg-to-leg BIA predicted MW within acceptable limits for the sport of wrestling. METHODS: Criterion MW was calculated by the 4C equation of Lohman (19) using independent measurement of body density (BD) by hydrostatic weighing, bone mineral content (BMC) by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and total body water (TBW) by deuterium dilution. Subjects were 57 wrestlers (mean +/- SD; age = 19.7 +/- 1.3 yr, height = 176.6 +/- 7.3 cm, weight = 77.7 +/- 12.4 kg). Hydration was confirmed by the NCAA guidelines. Accuracy, precision, and systematic bias were examined. RESULTS: Comparable mean values (72.2 +/- 9.7 vs 72.2 +/- 10.3 kg), a high correlation (r = 0.94), and a regression line similar to the line of identity were found between BIA and 4C. However, large individual differences and systematic bias were seen across the range of MW. BIA predicted MW within 3.5 kg 68% of the time and within 7.0 kg 95% of the time. MW residuals ranged from -10.4 kg to +6.9 kg. When using 2.5 kg as the cutoff for MW, BIA predicted MW within 2.5 kg 68% of the time and within 5.0 kg 95% of the time.",

Two forms (localized and multicentric) have been described. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is at the core of the disease, being responsible for most of the clinical and biological signs that may be observed. Despite the benignancy of this pre-lymphoma condition, its course is usually aggressive and of poor prognosis in regard to the multicentric form. No consensus regarding treatment has been defined. Available data on the multicentric form of the disease are to scarce to allow any conclusion about the treatment timing and type of chemotherapy best suited to this condition. We report the case of a patient in whom interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) was used as first line treatment. EXEGESIS: The case of a 52-year-old man with multicentric Castleman's disease combined with high IL-6, in whom, however, testing for human herpes virus-8 proved to be negative, is described. Interferon alpha (4.5 MU/m2 three times per week during 18 months) administered as first line treatment induced dramatic improvement in the patient's general condition and normalization of the tumoral syndrome.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Innovative strategies beyond the health system are required to reduce the prevalence of smoking. Early child development interventions are examples of interventions that can help set children on positive social and educational trajectories, which in turn may also reduce the prevalence of smoking. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of attendance at Kindergarten Union preschools on tobacco smoking in adulthood. METHODS: Kindergarten Union preschools delivered comprehensive services to children and their families, including education, parenting and health services, with a number of features consistent with contemporary ideas of high-quality service delivery. Using a retrospective cohort design with data from the North West Adelaide Health Study, this study examined different aspects of smoking behaviour in adults aged 34-67 years who attended a Kindergarten Union preschool at some stage between 1940 and 1972. Data were analysed using generalised linear model poisson regression with robust variance estimates, adjusting for both child and adult socio-economic factors and history of parental smoking. RESULTS: People who attended preschool had a reduced risk of ever smoking (prevalence ratio 0.87, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.98) and a reduced risk of current smoking in adulthood (prevalence ratio 0.77 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.00)), compared with those who did not attend preschool. There was no effect of preschool attendance on age at smoking uptake, age at quitting or the probability of quitting smoking.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the positive predictive value (PPV) of the malignancy of B3 lesions in order to establish their correct management in the setting of a multidisciplinary care pathway. METHODS: Data from all patients who had a Needle Core Biopsy (NCB) or a Vacuum-Assisted Needle Core Biopsy (VANCB) between 2005 and 2014 were retrospectively collected and analyzed. The B3 patients were discussed by the Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) deciding for surgery or for follow-up, based on a score in which clinical-instrumental factors and environmental factors were considered. The PPV of malignancy of all surgically excised B3 lesions was calculated. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-eight B3 NCBs were included in the study and Atypical Epithelial Proliferation of Ductal Type (AEDPT) was the most represented subcategory. The final histopathology report of the 128 patients operated on showed 94 benign and 34 malignant lesions. The PPV of B3 patients referred to surgery was 26.5%.",

Studies have shown the 2 procedures to have similar rates of recurrent or persistent HPT (0% to 10%). The majority of these reports are small case series and despite apparently similar outcomes; the optimal operative management for 2HPT remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there were any clinical outcome differences between these apparently comparable operations. METHODS: A meta-analysis of 53 publications on reoperative operation for 2HPT from 1983 to 2004 identified 501 patients who had undergone an operation for recurrent or persistent 2HPT. The data evaluated included the type of initial operation, the need for reoperative operation as it related to the type of initial operation, and the intraoperative findings. RESULTS: The initial operation had been a SPTX in 36% and a TPTX + AT in 64% of patients. Reoperative operation was for persistent 2HPT in 82 of 485 (17%) and for recurrent 2HPT in 403 of 485 (83%) patients. Findings at reoperation included: autograft hyperplasia (49%), supernumerary glands (20%), remnant hyperplasia (17%), a missed in situ gland (7%), and a negative exploration (5%). Supernumerary glands, missed in situ glands, and negative explorations occurred at equal rates for both operations. Reoperation determined that inadequate cervical explorations occurred in 42% of patients who had undergone a SPTX and in 34% of patients who had undergone a TPTX + AT.",

This research tested longitudinal measurement invariance of a 1-factor model of the metabolic syndrome during the course of 6 years. METHODS: Tests of longitudinal measurement invariance (configural, metric, and scalar) were conducted on 604 men and women who participated in the Spokane Heart Study from 1996 to 2006. Metabolic syndrome indicators included body mass index, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, diastolic blood pressure, and fasting glucose. RESULTS: Sequential configural and metric invariance models demonstrated adequate model fit, but the scalar invariance model led to a decrement in fit. Therefore, the theoretical framework of the syndrome and the relationships between the syndrome construct and the indicators appear to be equivalent over time. However, observed values of the metabolic syndrome indicators may differ across time when there is a constant level of the syndrome.",

RESULTS: Expression of IRX3 was higher in adipocytes compared to SVF. We found increased adipocyte-specific expression of IRX3 and IRX5 with the presence of the FTO risk haplotype in lean children, whereas it was unaffected by risk variants in obese peers. We further show that IRX3 expression was elevated in isolated adipocytes and AT of lean compared to obese children, particularly in UCP1-negative adipocytes, and inversely correlated with BMI SDS. Independent of BMI, IRX3 expression in adipocytes was significantly related to adipocyte hypertrophy, and subsequent associations with AT inflammation and HOMA-IR in the children.",

However, it remains unknown whether this relationship reflects the impact of more complex obstetric conditions or the variability in obstetric practices. We sought to quantify the independent role of the hospital as a variable that can influence the occurrence of caesarean section after induced labour. METHODS: As part of the Portuguese Generation XXI birth cohort, we evaluated 2041 consecutive women who underwent singleton pregnancies with labour induction, at five public level III obstetric units (April 2005-August 2006). The indications for induction were classified according to the guidelines of the American and the Royal Colleges of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Poisson regression models were adjusted to estimate the association between the hospital and surgical delivery after induction. Crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) and a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were computed. RESULTS: The proportion of women who were induced without formal clinical indications varied among hospitals from 20.3% to 45.5% (p<0.001). After adjusting for confounders, the risk of undergoing a caesarean section after induced labour remained significantly different between the hospitals, for the cases in which there was no evident indication for induction [the highest PR reaching 1.86 (95% CI, 1.23-2.82)]and also when at least one such indication was present [1.53 (95% CI, 1.12-2.10)].

METHODS: We studied 1,599 depressed primary care patients initiating antidepressant treatment from 63 family physicians in 4 primary care clinics of a staff-model health maintenance organization. Patients were interviewed 6 to 8 weeks after initiating antidepressant medication with a telephone structured interview that included the Structural Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Diagnoses (SCID). Automated databases of the HMO were used to examine 3 quality-of-care measures: (1) the percentage of patients who had a refill of their antidepressant by 6 weeks, (2) the percentage of patients who had a return visit by 3 weeks, and (3) the percentage of patients having a return visit by 6 weeks. The percentage of patients in each primary care physician panel who had>or =4 persistent DSM-IV depressive symptoms at 6 to 8 weeks was the main clinical outcome variable. To adjust for case-mix differences between physician panels, patient age, gender, and medical comorbidity were controlled for in the analyses. Two covariates were used to adjust for differences in patients' clinical severity: self-report of>or =2 prior depressive episodes and an SCID diagnosis of major depression during the patient's worst episode in the last 2 years. Physician age, gender, and part-time versus full-time practice were also used as covariates. RESULTS: The wide observed range of variability in quality-of-care and clinical outcome measures by physician practice decreased markedly in the statistical model that controlled for patient-level covariates and differences in the number of patients seen per provider. We did not detect differences in physician practice for the quality-of-care measures.

METHODS: We retrospectively identified 30 consecutive patients with metastatic prostate cancer who were treated with enzalutamide after docetaxel. Post-discontinuation PSA results were available for all patients and were determined at 2-weekly intervals until starting further anticancer systemic therapy. PSA withdrawal response was defined as a PSA decline by \u226550% from the last on-treatment PSA, with a confirmed decrease \u22653 weeks later. Patient characteristics were evaluated in relation to the AAWS using univariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The median (range) patient age was 70.5 (56-86) years and the median (range) follow-up was 9.0 (0.5-16) months. The most common metastatic sites were the bone (86.7%) and lymph nodes (66.7%). Most patients (70%) had previously received abiraterone and 12 patients (40%) had also received cabazitaxel. The median (range) treatment duration with enzalutamide was 3.68 (1.12-21.39) months. PSA levels after enzalutamide withdrawal were monitored for a median (range) time of 35 (10-120) days. Only one patient (3.3%) had a confirmed PSA response \u226550% after enzalutamide discontinuation. One patient (3.3%) had a confirmed PSA response of between 30 and 50% and another patient (3.3%) had an unconfirmed PSA response of between 30 and 50%. The median overall survival was 14.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 10.2-18.4).",

SUBJECTS: Consecutive patients admitted within 24 h of stroke onset to two hospitals. METHODS: A prospective study. Where possible, all patients had their ability to swallow assessed on the day of admission by both a doctor and a speech and language therapist using a standardized proforma. A videofluoroscopy examination was conducted within 3 days of admission. RESULTS: 94 patients underwent videofluoroscopy; 20 (21%) were seen to be aspirating, although this was not detected at the bedside in 10. In 18 (22%) of the patients the speech and language therapist considered the swallow to be unsafe. In the medical assessment, 39 patients (41%) had an unsafe swallow. Bedside assessment by a speech and language therapist gave a sensitivity of 47%, a specificity of 86%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 50% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 85% for the presence of aspiration. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify the optimum elements of the bedside assessments for predicting the presence of aspiration.

The objectives of this study were to compare clinical outcomes between ICSI cycles with and without oocytes affected by smooth endoplasmic reticulum aggregates and to confirm whether affected oocytes can produce healthy babies. METHODS: A prospective observational study was performed comparing 714 SERa- ICSI cycles to 112 SERa+ cycles. Among the SERa+ cycles, 518 SERa- oocytes and 213 SERa+ oocytes were analyzed. Fertilization, embryo quality, and pregnancy rates as well as neonatal outcomes were compared between SERa+ and SERa- cycles as well as between SERa+ and SERa- oocytes.

Given the increasing role of this treatment modality in the management of EOS, this study aimed to assess the psychological status of this patient population and to determine factors associated with worse scores in various psychosocial domains. METHODS: A cross-sectional assessment of 34 EOS patients was performed utilizing 2 well-established, caregiver-completed psychiatric instruments: the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire. Scores were calculated for 15 CBCL and 6 Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire domains and subdomains and grouped as \"Normal\" or \"Abnormal\" according to published normative values. The prevalence of abnormal scores was within each instrument subdomain and was compared with the national norms. Domain scores were also correlated with age at first scoliosis surgery, total number of operative procedures, and total number of growing instrumentation surgeries. RESULTS: A higher prevalence of Abnormal scores were found in multiple psychosocial domains in our cohort as compared with national normative data. Children with Abnormal CBCL \"Total Problems\" domain scores were younger at the time of first scoliosis surgery (2.50 vs. 5.52 y). Normal and Abnormal scoring groups showed significant differences in the number of (1) total surgeries; (2) total scoliosis surgeries; and (3) growing instrumentation surgeries in multiple domains on both instruments. Aggression, Rule-breaking, and Conduct were positively correlated with total number of surgeries.",

The contribution of the separate arteriolar and venular diameters to this AVR is unknown. Thus, associations between retinal arteriolar and venular diameters, and the AVR on the one hand and blood pressure, atherosclerosis, inflammation markers, and cholesterol levels on the other were examined in the Rotterdam Study. METHODS: In this cross-sectional population-based study, for one eye of each subject (>or =55 years; n = 5674), retinal arteriolar and venular diameters (in micrometers) of the blood columns were summed on digitized images. At baseline blood pressures, cholesterol levels, and markers of atherosclerosis and inflammation were also measured. RESULTS: With increasing blood and pulse pressures, retinal arteriolar and venular diameters and the AVR decreased significantly and linearly. Lower arteriolar diameters were associated with increased carotid intima-media thickness. Larger venular diameters were associated with higher carotid plaque score, more aortic calcifications, lower ankle-arm index, higher leukocyte count, higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate, higher total serum cholesterol, lower HDL, higher waist-to-hip ratio, and smoking. A lower AVR was related to increased carotid intima-media thickness, higher carotid plaque score, higher leukocyte count, lower HDL, higher body mass index, higher waist-to-hip ratio, and smoking.",

Therefore a new scale, the Motor Evaluation Scale for Upper Extremity in Stroke Patients (MESUPES), was developed, comprising 22 items pertaining to arm and hand performance. The scale was investigated for validity and unidimensionality using the Rasch measurement model, and for inter-rater reliability. SETTING: Twelve hospitals and rehabilitation centres in Belgium, Germany and Switzerland. PATIENTS: There were 396 patients (average age 63.38+/-12.89 years) in the Rasch study and 56 patients (average age 65.68+/-12.75 years) in the reliability study. MAIN MEASURES: The scale was examined on its fit to the Rasch model, thereby evaluating the scale's unidimensionality and validity. Differential item functioning was performed to test the stability of item hierarchy on several variables. Inter-rater reliability was examined with kappa values, weighted percentage agreement and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). RESULTS: Based on Rasch analysis, five items were removed. The MESUPES was divided in two tests: the MESUPES-arm test (8 items) and MESUPES-hand test (9 items). Both scales fitted the Rasch model. All items were stable among the subgroups of the sample. ICCs were 0.95 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 -0.97) and 0.97 (95% CI 0.95-0.98) for the total score on arm and hand test respectively.

METHODS: A probability sample of elderly community-dwelling adults in North Carolina was assembled in 1986 and followed for 6 years. Level of participation in private religious activities such as prayer, meditation, or Bible study was assessed by self-report at baseline, along with a wide variety of sociodemographic and health variables. The main outcome was time (days) to death or censoring. RESULTS: During a median 6.3-year follow-up period, 1,137 subjects (29.5%) died. Those reporting rarely to never participating in private religious activity had an increased relative hazard of dying over more frequent participants, but this hazard did not remain significant for the sample as a whole after adjustment for demographic and health variables. When the sample was divided into activity of daily living (ADL) impaired and unimpaired, the effect did not remain significant for the ADL impaired group after controlling for demographic variables (hazard ratio [RH] 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI]0.91-1.35). However, the increased hazard remained significant for the ADL unimpaired group even after controlling for demographic and health variables (RH 1.63, 95% CI 1.20-2.21), and this effect persisted despite controlling for numerous explanatory variables including health practices, social support, and other religious practices (RH 1.47, 95% CI 1.07-2.03).",

It remains unclear whether the clinical results of the latissimus dorsi transfer for massive posterosuperior rotator cuff tears are achieved either by active muscle contractions or by a passive tenodesis effect of the transfer. METHODS: Eight patients were evaluated preoperatively and at 1\u00a0year (SD, 0.1) after the latissimus dorsi transfer. Clinical evaluation of outcomes included active range of motion, Constant score, and visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and activities of daily living (ADL). Muscle activity was recorded with EMG during directional isometric abduction and adduction tasks. RESULTS: The external rotation in adduction improved from 23\u00b0 to 51\u00b0 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.03). The external rotation in abduction improved from 10\u00b0 to 70\u00b0 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.02). The mean Constant score improved from 39 to 62 postoperatively (P\u00a0=\u00a0.01).

The criteria for unresectability vary from one team to another. To clarify this issue, we retrospectively assessed the survival and characteristics of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients with liver-limited disease (LLD) who underwent conversion therapy. METHOD: Our criteria for resectability depended on the size of the remnant liver volume (>30 %) and expected function after removal of all metastases. Between December 2007 and September 2011, a total of 115 patients were diagnosed as having mCRC with LLD and received chemotherapy. Among them, 47 had tumors that were initially diagnosed as resectable. They underwent hepatic resection after chemotherapy (resected group). Of the 67 tumors were initially diagnosed as unresectable, 12 became resectable after chemotherapy (conversion group), leaving 55 tumors that remained unresectable after chemotherapy (unresected group). RESULTS: The median follow-up was 25.2 months. Hepatic resection was more invasive in the conversion group than in the resected group. Median disease-free survival was significantly higher in the resected group than in the conversion group (p = 0.013).

METHODS: Thirty health care providers participated in an in-hospital cardiac arrest simulation with 1 minute of continuous chest compressions. Chest compressions were performed on a manikin lying on a bed according to visual feedback from an accelerometer feedback device. The manikin and accelerometer recorded chest compression data simultaneously. The simulated patient was deemed to have survived when the chest compression data satisfied all of the preset high-quality chest compression criteria (depth \u226551 mm, rate>100 per minute, and \u226595% full recoil). Survival rates were calculated from the feedback device and manikin data.

The G2019S change in LRRK2 exon 41 has been associated with disease at varying frequencies in Asian, European, North American, and North African populations, and is particularly prevalent among Ashkenazi Jews. METHODS: We assessed the occurrence of the LRRK2 G2019S, I2012T, I2020T, and R1441G/C/H mutations in our cohort of Jewish Israeli patients with PD, and determined the LRRK2 haplotypes in 76 G2019S-carriers detected and in 50 noncarrier Ashkenazi patients, using six microsatellite markers that span the entire gene. RESULTS: Only the G2019S mutation was identified among our patients with PD, 14.8% in the Ashkenazi and 2.7% in the non-Ashkenazi patients, and in 26% and 10.6% of the Ashkenazi familial and apparently sporadic cases. The carrier frequencies in the Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi control samples were 2.4% and 0.4%.

This issue might be further complicated in the case of xenotransplantation. Zoonotic viruses could reactivate and replicate in the transplanted tissue, and interactions with homologous human viruses could take place. Since the pig is a favoured animal as donor of organs for human transplants, we analysed the possibility of interactions between porcine and human herpesviruses. Porcine lymphotropic herpesvirus 1 (PLHV-1) is a gammaherpesvirus homologous to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and to human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), is highly prevalent in pigs and is associated to lymphoproliferative disease in immunosuppressed and transplanted miniature swine. METHODS: The main viral transactivators of PLHV-1, ORF50, ORF57, ORFA6/BZLF1(h), were cloned and tested for their transactivating ability on several EBV and HHV-8 promoters using reporter assays. Also the effects of HHV-8 ORF50, ORF57 and ORFK8 and EBV BRLF1/ R-transactivator (Rta) and BZLF1/ Z-transactivator (Zta) on PLHV-1 lytic promoters were analysed. RESULTS: Porcine lymphotropic herpesvirus 1 ORF50 upregulated all HHV-8 promoters and PLHV-1 ORFA6/BZLF1(h) transactivated EBV promoters. Furthermore, transfection of PLHV-1 ORF50 into HHV-8-infected cells resulted in a decrease of HHV-8 replication.",

In addition, wine consumption has decreased whereas beer intake has risen. Consequently, it is uncertain if the Mediterranean drinking pattern (MDP; moderate alcohol intake mainly from wine and during meals) is a habitual feature of the MD today. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cross-sectional study conducted from 2008 to 2010 among 8894 individuals representative of the Spanish population aged 18-64 years. Consumption of alcoholic beverages and food was collected with a validated diet history. Accordance with the MD was defined as a score \u22658 on the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) or \u22655 in the Trichopoulou index (after excluding alcohol intake from both indices). Among individuals with MEDAS-based MD accordance, only 17.1% had a MDP. After adjustment for potential confounders, this drinking pattern showed a weak association with higher MD accordance (odds ratio (OR) 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12-1.57). Only 14.7% of those with Trichopoulou-based MD accordance had a MDP; this pattern showed an even weaker association with higher MD accordance (OR 1.17; 95% CI 1.01-1.36).

BACKGROUND DATA: In patients with lumbar spinal stenosis-like disorders, small compressions are sometimes observed in magnetic resonance images acquired in the recumbent position, leading to potential misdiagnosis. Few prospective studies have compared the diagnostic accuracy of MRI, myelography, and CTM. Therefore, it is not clear whether myelography is necessary or not. METHODS: Fifty-four patients fulfilled the criteria. All patients underwent MRI, myelography, and CTM. MRI was performed with the patient in a normal recumbent position, and CTM was performed with the patients in both a recumbent and extended positions. All patients underwent surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis. Findings from visual examinations (sagittal images of MR, axial images of MR, axial reconstruction images of CTM and myelograms) were defined as compression + or -. We analyzed the sensitivity of the different examinations for diagnosis and the relationship among the types of images. RESULTS: Sensitivity was as follows: CTM 94.4 %, myelography 87.0 %, and MRI 75.9 %. In myelography, the images of 37 patients were worsened by dynamic synthesis (Dyn+). Among patients without compression on MRI, 11 showed compression on myelography. Of these 11, 8 of these patients were Dyn+, and 2 patients showed compression on myelography, but not on CTM and were Dyn+. Thus, some compression can be revealed only with myelography. CTM was more sensitive than axial MRI and showed compression in 10 patients who were Dyn+.",

The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that consumption of amphetamine and/or cocaine in addition to cannabis would lead to an earlier age at onset of schizophrenia than that seen for cannabis consumption alone. A secondary objective was to determine what kind of effect additional substance use exerted (e.g. additive, multiplicative). METHOD: Patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia were recruited from consecutive admissions to the inpatient and outpatient services of a large psychiatric hospital in Perth, Australia and 167 participants were assessed using the Diagnostic Interview for Psychosis, which included detailed inquiry into illicit drug use in the 12 months prior to the onset of psychiatric symptoms. Participants were categorized into four groups: no illicit substance use (n = 65), cannabis use (n = 68), cannabis plus amphetamine use (n = 25), and cocaine plus cannabis/cocaine plus cannabis plus amphetamine use (n = 9). Analysis of variance was performed to detect trends, and linear regression used to analyze the consumption of each additional substance as a predictor of age at onset.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Direct to consumer (DTC) advertising, targeting the public over the physician, is an increasingly pervasive presence in medical clinics. It is trending toward a format of online interaction rather than that of traditional print and television advertising. METHODS: We analyze patient-focused Web pages from the top 5 companies supplying prostheses for total hip arthroplasties, comparing them to the top 10 independent medical websites. Quantitative comparison is performed using the Journal of American Medical Association benchmark and DISCERN criteria, and for comparative readability, we use the Flesch-Kincaid grade level, the Flesch reading ease, and the Gunning fog index. Content is analyzed for information on type of surgery and surgical approach. RESULTS: There is a statistically significant difference between the independent and DTC websites in both the mean DISCERN score (independent 74.6, standard deviation [SD]\u00a0= 4.77; DTC 32.2, SD\u00a0= 10.28; P\u00a0= .0022) and the mean Journal of American Medical Association score (Independent 3.45, SD\u00a0= 0.49; DTC 1.9, SD\u00a0= 0.74; P\u00a0= .004).

However, there is significant variability in market characteristics which affect transplant programs' donor organ acceptance practices and OPOs' ability to successfully place higher risk organs. The impact of transplant market characteristics on OPO performance metrics has not been evaluated. METHODS: The OPO performance measures were correlated annually with the Herfindahl Hirschman Index, a standard measure of market competition for centers within the OPO donor service areas from 2003 to 2011. RESULTS: More competitive donor service areas were associated with increased number of donors (P = 0.01) and eligible deaths (P<0.001). Market competition was associated with increased use of high Donor Risk Index for kidney (P = 0.03) and liver (P = 0.01) allografts. The OPOs with increased competition in liver transplant also were noted to have a higher donor conversion rate (P<0.001), more donors per million population (P<0.001), and a higher utilization rate for liver allografts (P = 0.007).",

The factors that were investigated included the use of a dry heat block versus a hot water bath to heat the (99m)Tc-sulfur colloid bulk vial, amount of (99m)TcOH4(-) added to form the sulfur colloid particles, time between the unit dose calibration and the injection of the dose, and breast quadrant in which the injection occurred. METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively and quantitatively analyzed from images and reports of 488 patients with breast cancer who had undergone SLN mapping and intraoperative SLN identification from January 1, 2008, to June 30, 2011, inclusive. The dependent variables assessed were the number of SLNs visualized during lymphoscintigraphy, number of radioactive SLNs removed during surgery, and total number of lymph nodes removed intraoperatively. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in outcomes when comparing the amount of (99m)TcOH4(-) added during the preparation process to form the sulfur colloid particles, time between the unit dose calibration time and the time that the unit doses were injected, or location in the breast tissue in which the unit dose was administered. Initially, there were observed significant differences in outcomes when the heating methods used to prepare the (99m)Tc-sulfur colloid were compared. When the increased number of patients who were administered a calibrated unit dose activity of 74 MBq in the group that was heated in a hot water bath was compared with the group that was heated in a dry heat block, there was a significant difference in the number of SLNs visualized during lymphoscintigraphy (P = .001).

A pooled regression coefficient was calculated for the entire group as well as for males and females separately. RESULTS: Data from 11 study populations were pooled (n = 2301). These populations differed with respect to geographical area, age, sex distribution, inclusion criteria and gestational age. We found a statistically significant inverse association between birth weight and circulating cortisol level: a 1 kg lower birth weight was associated with a 25.3 nmol/l (95% confidence interval (CI): 5.9-44.8) higher cortisol level. Separate results were reported for males and females in six study populations. The association in males was 20.6 nmol/l per kg (95% CI: 4.2-37.0) and in females it was 30.9 nmol/l per kg (95% CI: 7.4-54.4).",

        "input": "PURPOSE: Mossy fibers are the sole excitatory projection from dentate gyrus granule cells to the hippocampus, forming part of the trisynaptic hippocampal circuit. They undergo significant plasticity during epileptogenesis and have been implicated in seizure generation. Mossy fibers are a highly unusual projection in the mammalian brain; in addition to glutamate, they release adenosine, dynorphin, zinc, and possibly other peptides. Mossy fiber terminals also show intense immunoreactivity for the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and immunoreactivity for GAD67. The purpose of this review is to present physiologic evidence of GABA release by mossy fibers and its modulation by epileptic activity. METHODS: We used hippocampal slices from 3- to 5-week-old guinea pigs and made whole-cell voltage clamp recordings from CA3 pyramidal cells. We placed stimulating electrodes in stratum granulosum and adjusted their position in order to recruit mossy fiber to CA3 projections. RESULTS: We have shown that electrical stimuli that recruit dentate granule cells elicit monosynaptic GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic signals in CA3 pyramidal neurons. These inhibitory signals satisfy the criteria that distinguish mossy fiber-CA3 synapses: high sensitivity to metabotropic glutamate-receptor agonists, facilitation during repetitive stimulation, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-independent long-term potentiation.",

DESIGN: Controlled before and after study. SETTING: 152 commissioning organisations (primary care trusts) in England. METHODS: National surveys of commissioning managers in 2009 and 2010 to identify: the largest marginal investments made in four key conditions/services (diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic pulmonary airways disease and emergency and urgent care) in 2008/2009 and 2009/2010; the outcomes commissioners expected to achieve with these investments; and the processes commissioners used to develop these investments. Collation of routinely available data on outcomes commissioners expected from these investments over the period 2007/2008 to 2010/2011. RESULTS: 51% (77/152) of commissioners agreed to participate in the survey in 2009 and 60% (91/152) in 2010. Around half reported targeted marginal investments in each condition/service each year. Routine data on many of the outcomes they expected to achieve through these investments were not available. Also, commissioners expected some outcomes to be achieved beyond the time scale of our study. Therefore, only a limited number of outcomes of investments were tested. Outcomes included directly standardised emergency admission rates for the four conditions/services, and the percentage of patients with diabetes with glycated haemoglobin<7. There was no evidence that targeted marginal investments reduced emergency admission rates. There was evidence of an improvement in blood glucose management for diabetes for commissioners investing to improve diabetes care but this was compromised by a lack of investment in other areas.",
        "output": "The results of this study suggest that targeted marginal investments in healthcare commissioning in England are not producing the outcomes commissioners hope to achieve. This is likely to be due to a lack of investment in other areas, and the lack of routine data on outcomes commissioners expected to achieve."

        "input": "PURPOSE: To assess the ability of computed tomography (CT) to differentiate an atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma (WDLPS) from a WDLPS with a dedifferentiated component (DDLPS) within it. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-nine untreated patients with abdominal atypical lipomatous tumors/well-differentiated liposarcomas who had undergone contrast-enhanced CT were identified using an institutional database. Three radiologists who were blinded to the pathology findings evaluated all the images independently to determine whether a dedifferentiated component was present within the WDLPS. The CT images were evaluated for fat content (\u226425% or>25%); presence of ground-glass density, enhancing and/or necrotic nodules; presence of a capsule surrounding the mass; septations; and presence and pattern of calcifications. A multivariate logistic regression model with generalized estimating equations was used to correlate imaging features with pathology findings. Kappa statistics were calculated to assess agreement between the three radiologists. RESULTS: On the basis of pathological findings, 12 patients had been diagnosed with DDLPS within a WDLPS and 37 had been diagnosed with WDLPS. The presence of an enhancing or a centrally necrotic nodule within the atypical lipomatous tumor was associated with dedifferentiated liposarcoma (P = 0.02 and P = 0.0003, respectively). The three readers showed almost perfect agreement in overall diagnosis (\u03ba r = 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.67-0.99).",

PATIENTS: 31 consecutive patients with new-onset atrial fibrillation (<24 h before presentation) persisting at least 48 h, without evidence of heart failure. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Plasma NT-proBNP levels were obtained at presentation and then 6, 12, 18, and 24 h after presentation. A final sample was obtained 48 h after onset of AF. RESULTS: Mean plasma NT-proBNP levels and 95% CIs (pg/ml) during the 48-h period following onset of AF were: 0-6 h: 636 (395 to 928), 6-12 h: 1364 (951 to 1778), 12-18 h: 1747 (1412 to 2083), 18-24 h: 1901 (1549 to 2253), 24-36 h: 1744 (1423 to 2066) and 36-48 h: 1101 (829 to 1373).

        "input": "PURPOSE: Surveys of cancer patients are an important means of collecting data necessary to improve cancer prevention and control. However, health surveys generally are characterized by declining response rates, with incentives often employed to encourage participation. While successful, magnitude of effect is partially dependent upon situational characteristics of respondents, including health status. Given the health challenges experienced by cancer patients, it is unclear to what extent incentives can improve survey participation. In this study, we examine the effectiveness of monetary and non-monetary incentives in improving response to cancer patient surveys. METHODS: We reviewed the available experimental literature regarding efforts to improve response rates among cancer patients/survivors via incentives. Relevant studies were identified through searches of the MEDLINE, PubMed, and PsychINFO databases from 1975 to 2012. Seed sources (e.g., Cancer Causes&Control, Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers&Prevention, and BMC Medical Research Methodology) were also referenced extensively in order to establish a comprehensive set of studies. RESULTS: Although limited, evidence does suggest that token incentives may be less effective for improving survey participation among cancer patients, relative to other population groups. These results are contrary to well-established evidence regarding the efficacy of incentives in improving survey participation generally. Potential reasons why incentives may be less effective in this population are explored.",

By reducing doses of CsA or FK, we expected that renal function would improve. METHOD AND MATERIAL: Twenty-one patients with CAN had sirolimus added as an immunosuppressive agent. We evaluated the creatinine (Cr) level 3 months after addition. The doses of CsA and FK were decreased gradually and then eliminated over a course of 4 to 6 weeks. If the Cr level rose rapidly or other prominent signs of rejection occurred; low-dose CsA or FK would be added per protocol. We evaluated the duration of engraftment before sirolimus and the Cr level when it was added. RESULTS: Renal function improved in 13 of 21 cases.

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: To understand the impact of cytoreductive nephrectomy on the ability to receive systemic therapy in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Causes of delayed eligibility and effect on overall survival (OS) were investigated. METHODS: Patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who underwent cytoreductive nephrectomy between 2002 and 2010 were identified. Those ineligible to receive systemic therapy>2 months after surgery were considered delayed. Reasons for delay and effect on OS were investigated, including a thorough analysis of surgical morbidity. RESULTS: Of 65 patients identified, 28% experienced delayed eligibility for systemic therapy. Reasons for delay were related to surgery in 33%, disease progression in 56%, and both in 11%. Of the entire cohort, pT4 and sarcomatoid disease predicted poor outcomes with median OS of 9.8 and 7.6 months, respectively. Comparison of the delay vs no delay groups revealed more intraoperative complications (P=.01), a trend toward more high-grade postoperative complications (17% vs 4%, P=.09), and a median OS of 4.8 vs 18.9 months.

Recent studies suggest that computed tomography (CT)-generated images have higher diagnostic accuracy than plain films for the classification of acetabular fractures. However, similar studies have not been performed for pelvic ring injuries. The purpose of this study was to compare CT-generated and plain radiographs in terms of the ability of surgeons at different experience levels to identify pelvic injury type. METHODS: CT-generated and plain radiograph image sets were created from 15 pelvic ring injury patients with known classification morphology. Three groups, each consisting of three orthopaedic surgeons representing different levels of expertise, viewed these image sets and recorded their diagnoses. These diagnoses were compared to the gold standard findings of the treating physician and to each other. RESULTS: Overall, there was a significantly improved ability to correctly classify pelvic ring injury type by CT-generated radiographs as compared to plain radiographs (p<0.01).

METHODS: Between February 2009 and February 2012, a total of 384 patients who suffered Stanford type A aortic dissection involving aortic arch underwent total aortic arch replacement with frozen elephant trunk. Of these patients, 36 patients had PCS. Logistic regression was used to identify if the previous cardiac surgery was the risk factor for in-hospital mortality. Propensity score-matching (1:1 match) was used to yield patients from the primary surgery group who matched PCS group with respect to pre-operative clinical characteristics and post-operative complications. Survival analysis and differences between the two groups were performed by the Kaplan-Meier estimate and the log-rank test. RESULTS: The overall in-hospital mortality was 8%. Logistic multiple regression identified that cardiopulmonary bypass time\u2265 300minutes (OR=12.05, p<0.001) and surgical period from symptom onset shorter than one week (OR=2.43, p=0.04) were final risk factors for in-hospital mortality and PCS was not the final risk factor.

OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine: (1) whether diskectomy resulted in greater improvement in back pain than nonoperative treatment, and (2) whether herniation location and morphology affected back pain outcomes. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Previous studies have reported that lumbar diskectomy is less successful for relief of back pain than leg pain and patients with central disc herniations or protrusions have worse outcomes. METHODS: Patients underwent diskectomy or received \"usual\" nonoperative care. Data from the randomized cohort and observational cohort were combined in an as-treated analysis. Low back pain was recorded on a 0 to 6 point scale, and changes in low back pain were compared between the surgical and nonoperative treatment groups. The effects of herniation location and morphology on back pain outcomes were determined. RESULTS: The combined analysis included 1191 patients with 775 undergoing surgery within 2 years, whereas 416 remained nonoperative. Overall, leg pain improved more than back pain in both treatment groups. Back pain improved in both surgical and nonoperative patients, but surgical patients improved significantly more (treatment effect favoring surgery -0.9 at 3 months, -0.5 at 2 years, P<0.001). Patients who underwent surgery were more likely to report no back pain than nonoperative patients at each follow-up period (28.0% vs. 12.0% at 3 months, P<0.001, 25.5% vs. 17.6% at 2 years, P = 0.009).

METHODS: We analysed data from 567,049 respondents to the 2011/2012 English General Practice Patient Survey who reported at least one in-hours primary care consultation in the preceding 6\u2005months. Of those respondents, 7% also reported using out-of-hours primary care. We used logistic regression to explore associations between use of out-of-hours primary care and five measures of in-hours access (ease of getting through on the telephone, ability to see a preferred general practitioner, ability to get an urgent or routine appointment and convenience of opening hours). We illustrated the potential for reduction in use of out-of-hours primary care in a model where access to in-hours care was made optimal. RESULTS: Worse in-hours access was associated with greater use of out-of-hours primary care for each access factor. In multivariable analysis adjusting for access and patient characteristic variables, worse access was independently associated with increased out-of-hours use for all measures except ease of telephone access. Assuming these associations were causal, we estimated that an 11% relative reduction in use of out-of-hours primary care services in England could be achievable if access to in-hours care were optimal.",

This study compared the preference values for EQ-5D-5L health states between mainland Chinese and Singaporean Chinese. METHODS: The preference values for ten EQ-5D-5L health states were elicited from general population samples of mainland Chinese and Singaporeans. In computer-assisted self-interviews, each participant completed five time trade-off (TTO) tasks to value five different EQ-5D-5L health states. The difference in TTO values between mainland Chinese and Singaporean Chinese was examined using random-effects linear regression and logistic regression models. RESULTS: A total of 194 eligible mainland Chinese and 145 eligible Singaporean Chinese provided data for this study. All ten health states considered, the mean TTO value was 0.18 for Singaporean Chinese and 0.35 for mainland Chinese, with the unadjusted and adjusted difference [95% confidence interval (CI)] being -0.17 (-0.28, -0.07) and -0.16 (-0.27, -0.05). Singaporean Chinese had substantially lower TTO values than mainland Chinese for states with severe or extreme problems, with the adjusted difference being -0.30 (95% CI -0.42, -0.17). On the other hand, Singaporean Chinese and mainland Chinese had similar TTO values for states with mild or moderate problems, with the adjusted (95% CI) difference being 0.04 (-0.07, 0.15). Logistic regression analysis showed that Singaporean Chinese were more likely to rate health states with severe or extreme problems as worse than death compared to mainland Chinese.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: As access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) has grown in Africa, attention has turned to evaluating the socio-economic impacts of ART. One key issue is the extent to which improvements in health resulting from ART allows individuals to return to work and earn income. Improvements in health from ART may also be associated with reduced impaired presenteeism, which is the loss of productivity when an ill or disabled individual attends work but accomplishes less at his or her usual tasks or shifts to other, possibly less valuable, tasks. METHODS: Longitudinal data for this analysis come from company payroll records for 97 HIV-infected tea estate workers (the index group, 56 women, 41 men) and a comparison group of all workers assigned to the same work teams (n = 2485, 1691 men, 794 women) for a 37-month period covering two years before and one year after initiating ART. We used nearest neighbour matching methods to estimate the impacts of HIV/AIDS and ART on three monthly employment outcomes for tea estate workers in Kenya--days plucking tea, days assigned to non-plucking assignments, and kilograms harvested when plucking. RESULTS: The female index group worked 30% fewer days plucking tea monthly than the matched female comparison group during the final 9 months pre-ART. They also worked 87% more days on non-plucking assignments. While the monthly gap between the two groups narrowed after beginning ART, the female index group worked 30% fewer days plucking tea and about 100% more days on non-plucking tasks than the comparison group after one year on ART. The male index group was able to maintain a similar pattern of work as their comparison group except during the initial five months on therapy.",

Given the controversy of prophylactic central neck dissection (pCND) in clinically nodal-negative (cN0) PTC, our study evaluated whether preoperative NLR predicted disease-free survival (DFS) and occult central nodal metastasis (CNM) in cN0 PTC. METHODS: A total of 191 patients who underwent pCND were analyzed. Complete blood counts with differential counts were taken before operation. NLR was calculated by dividing preoperative neutrophil count with lymphocyte count. Patients were categorized into NLR tertiles: first (NLR<1.93; n = 63), second (NLR = 1.93-2.79; n = 64), and third tertile (NLR>2.79; n = 64). Four other patient types, namely, benign nodular goiter, clinically nodal-positive (cN1) PTC, poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma, and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), were used as references. RESULTS: Age at operation (p<0.001) and tumor size (p = 0.037) significantly increased with higher NLR.

METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database from 1988 to 2007 was queried for cases of resected Grades II (atypical) and III (malignant) meningioma. Disease-specific survival outcomes were determined using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the likelihood of receiving EBRT for Grade II versus Grade III. Because atypical and malignant meningiomas underwent WHO reclassification in 2000, the authors carried out an additional analysis of outcomes of these tumors from 2000 to 2008. RESULTS: There were 657 patients included in the analysis; of these, 244 received adjuvant radiation. Compared with patients with Grade II meningioma, patients with Grade III disease were 41.9% more likely to receive EBRT after gross-total resection and 36.7% more likely to receive it after subtotal resection (95% CI 0.58-3.26). Controlling for grade, extent of resection, size and anatomical location of the tumor, year of diagnosis, race, age, and sex, adjuvant EBRT did not impart a survival benefit (HR 1.492; 95% CI 0.827-2.692).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A renal artery revascularization database (1987-2007) was reviewed to identify patients who underwent renal intervention during EVAR and those who had an intervention in the absence of EVAR. Outcomes were analyzed with respect to patient comorbidities, renal anatomy and function, procedural events, and postoperative complications. RESULTS: A total of 413 patients (239 men; 58%) underwent 589 renal artery revascularizations (51 with EVAR and 362 without). Mean age was 70 years +/- 10. Mean follow-up was 3.5 years (range, 1-13 y). Primary indications for renal intervention were hypertension (63%) and elevated creatinine level (27%). The EVAR group was more likely to incur an increased creatinine level at 1 month after intervention (33% vs 18%; P = .007). Freedom from restenosis was similar (P = .501), but arterial occlusion rate was higher in the EVAR group (96% +/- 3% vs 100% +/- 10% cumulative patency at 3 y; P = .005).

The post-MI health disparities experienced by black older adults may be attributable to the social and health correlates of race. We explored patterns of change in functional status in a community-based sample of 243 older white and black persons hospitalized for an incident MI. METHODS: The study sample was drawn from the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE). All older adults hospitalized for an incident MI between the first two waves of data collection were followed up yearly for two additional years. Nonlinear quadratic trajectories of functional status, as measured by disability in activities of daily living (ADL) and functional limitation (FL), were fit using mixed-effects models. RESULTS: Although there were no nonlinear differences in ADL trajectories, there was a faster nonlinear rate of change in FL in older blacks compared to whites, independent of other social and health factors. The baseline white-black gap in FL widened after the MI by the first follow-up, continued to widen at a less accelerated pace until the second follow-up, and narrowed by the third follow-up.",

This syndrome is linked to acute intra-alveolar haemorrhage related to early tumour necrosis, which in turn, can be complicated by pulmonary infection promoted by neutropenia. The management of these patients was modified at Institut Gustave Roussy in 1997 to try to avoid this complication. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data concerning all patients with lung metastases from NSGCT and dyspnoea or a partial pressure of oxygen (pO(2))<80 mmHg treated from 1980 to 2006 in our institution were collected. Patients were treated in a specialised intensive care unit. From 1980 to 1997, the first chemotherapy cycle consisted in a full-dose regimen. After 1997, a 3-day reduced induction regimen of EP (cisplatin 20 mg/m(2)/day and etoposide 100 mg/m(2)/day) was used, with bleomycin and two additional days of EP being postponed to day 15, with the regular BEP regimen being started at day 21. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients with poor-risk disseminated NSGCT according to the International Germ Cell Consensus Classification Group had extensive lung metastases plus dyspnoea at presentation (n = 6), a pO(2)<80 mmHg (n = 14) or both (n = 7). The median age was 34 years (range, 18-52 years). The median number of metastases was 10 (range, 2-20). The median number of cycles of chemotherapy was 3 (range, 1-10).

All women delivered preterm neonates who had neurosonograms on the 3rd and 7th days of life. The results of the neurosonograms were used to divide the study population first into normal and abnormal groups, then into normal, minor, and major brain lesion groups. The groups were compared for the median neuron-specific enolase, proportion with values of 6 microg/L or more, and other demographic characteristics. RESULTS: There were no differences between the groups' maternal and neonatal characteristics. However, the abnormal group had significantly higher median value of neuron-specific enolase than the normal group (9.5 microg/L and 2.0 microg/L, respectively; P<.001).

This is despite the fact that continuing education is an embedded feature of quality assurance in general practice. There are a variety of clinical practice education methods available for dissemination of new evidence. Recent systematic reviews indicate that the effectiveness of these different strategies is extremely variable. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine whether a peer-led small group education pilot programme used to promote rational GP prescribing is an effective tool in changing practice when added to prescribing audit and feedback, academic detailing and educational bulletins, and to determine whether any effect seen decays over time. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a controlled trial of a small group education strategy with 24 month follow-up was carried out. The setting was an independent GPs association (IPA) of 230 GPs in the Christchurch New Zealand urban area. All intervention and control group GPs were already receiving prescribing audit and feedback, academic detailing and educational bulletins. The intervention group were the first 52 GPs to respond to an invitation to pilot the project. Two control groups were used, one group who joined the pilot later and a second group which included all other GPs in the IPA. The main outcome measures were targeted prescribing data for 12 months before and 24 months after each of four education sessions. RESULTS: An effect in the expected direction was seen in six of the eight key messages studied. This effect was statistically significant for five of the eight messages studied.

OBJECTIVE: To determine if sedimentation sign on magnetic resonance image can help with LSS treatment decisions. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: LSS is one of the most common reasons for surgery in the US elderly, but there is a dearth of reliable diagnostic tools that give a clear indication for surgery. Recent studies have suggested that positive sedimentation sign on magnetic resonance image may be a possible prognostic indicator. METHODS: All patients with LSS in both the randomized and observational cohorts had imaging-confirmed stenosis, were surgical candidates, and had neurogenic claudication for at least 12 weeks prior to enrollment. Patients were categorized as \"mild,\" \"moderate,\" or \"severe\" according to stenosis severity. Of the 654 patients with LSS enrolled in Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial, complete T2-weighted axial and sagittal digitized images of 115 patients were available for retrospective review. An independent orthopedic spine surgeon evaluated these deidentified Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine files for the sedimentation sign. RESULTS: Sixty-six percent (76/115) of patients were found to have a positive sedimentation sign. Those with a positive sedimentation sign were more likely to have stenosis at L2-L3 (33% vs. 10% P=0.016) or L3-L4 76% vs. 51%, P=0.012), and to have severe (72% vs. 33%, P=0.001) or moderate (64% vs. 33%, P=0.001) stenosis. Patients with a positive sedimentation sign were more likely to have a positive surgical outcome (76% vs. 51%, P=0.001).",
        "output": "The presence of a positive sedimentation sign on magnetic resonance image is associated with more severe stenosis and a higher likelihood of a positive surgical outcome."

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) containing neuroactive drugs is associated with better neuropsychological performance in patients with human immunodeficiency virus disease. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Tertiary referral hospital outpatient clinics. PATIENTS: The study population consisted of 97 individuals positive for human immunodeficiency virus (stage C3, 1993 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classification) whose condition had been stable on their current HAART regimen for a mean +/- SD of 18.5 +/- 16.5 months and who were aged 48.14 +/- 9.38 years. The patient groups were analyzed according to whether their regimen contained 3 or more neuroactive drugs (neuroHAART group; n = 41) or not (HAART group; n = 56). Thirty seronegative men matched for age and education were recruited as controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Neuropsychological performance on 7 cognitive domains. RESULTS: The neuroHAART and HAART groups did not differ from one another on neuropsychological performance, but both patient groups were impaired compared with controls. Impaired patients in each treatment group were compared, and the neuroHAART group showed significantly better memory performance, unrelated to plasma viral load, than the HAART group.",

        "input": "INTRODUCTION: Previous studies reported that the radiation exposure to the hands of orthopaedic surgeons was far below the acceptable limit. However, the risk could have been underestimated as some factors were overlooked, namely monitoring trainees during average workload, placing dosimeters over the most susceptible locations, measuring the cumulative dosage of radiation and considering the dose limit for non-classified workers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective study in two centres to estimate the radiation dose to the hands of two consultant trauma surgeons and two trainees (one assisting and one operating) while performing 47 fluoroscopy-assisted procedures. We used validated thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) rings and fingerstalls for monitoring the cumulative dosage. RESULTS: Trainees were at higher risk while performing intramedullary nailing and during assistance. Higher radiation doses were recorded from dominant index fingers and particularly fingertips.",

We aimed to analyze the relationship between concentrations of four novel biomarkers and neurological symptoms: Neopterin, PTX3, sCD163, and sTREM-1. In addition, we analyzed the relationship between these markers and the presence of coronary (CAD) and peripheral (PAD) artery disease. DESIGN AND METHODS: Serum biomarker levels were determined in 100 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy; 33 for stroke, 32 for transient ischemic attack, and 23 for amaurosis fugax. 12 Patients were asymptomatic. Risk factors for atherosclerotic disease and history of CAD and PAD were also assessed. RESULTS: Symptomatic patients did not show significantly elevated biomarker levels compared to asymptomatic patients and levels did not differ among symptomatic subgroups.

However, longer stems are more difficult to insert and reduce femoral bone stock for future revisions.QUESTIONS/ PURPOSES: We investigated (1) how frequently a short (\u2264 160-mm or primary-length) fully porous-coated stem could be utilized for Paprosky Type I to IIIA femoral defects, (2) how often the tip of the old stem or cement mantle was bypassed by the revision implant, (3) Harris hip scores, radiographic signs of osseointegration, and revision frequency, and (4) complications associated with these reconstructions. METHODS: Two surgeons performed 277 femoral revisions graded as Paprosky Types I to IIIA between 2004 and 2009. When femoral canal diameter was less than 18 mm, these surgeons generally used the shortest stem capable of achieving a minimum of 4 cm of scratch fit in the femoral isthmus. Patients were evaluated clinically using the Harris hip score and radiographically for component loosening and to determine whether the revision component bypassed the prior stem tip or cement mantle. RESULTS: A short stem was utilized in 144 of the 277 revisions (52%). In 113 (78%), the revision femoral component did not bypass the tip of the prior stem or cement mantle. The Harris hip score improved (p<0.001) from 36 preoperatively to 76 at a mean of 4 years (range, 2-8 years). Twelve stems required repeat revision including six (4.9%) for failed ingrowth.

Eigendecomposition and signal reconstruction of district temperature and humidity were performed to establish any cyclic variation. Average temperatures and humidity values were calculated at time periods of 15, 30, 45 and 60 days preceding each renal colic. RESULTS: Patients were allocated to groups every 30 days, since eigendeanalysis suggested that intervals of this duration have homogeneous climatic features. With an average time period of 15 days preceding each renal colic, a positive correlation coefficient of temperature (r = +0.75 with CI 0.31-0.93, p<0.005) and a cubic relationship at the regression analysis (R = 82.4%, p = 0.015) were found with the onset of colics.

However, given high rates of empiric treatment amongst hospitalised patients in high-burden settings (\u2248 50%) it is unclear whether LAM can add any value to clinical decision making, or identify a subset of patients with unfavourable outcomes that would otherwise have been missed by empiric treatment. METHODS: 281 HIV-infected hospitalised patients with suspected TB received urine LAM strip testing, and were categorised as definite (culture-positive), probable-, or non-TB. Both the proportion and morbidity of TB cases identified by LAM testing, early empiric treatment (initiated prior to test result availability) and a set of clinical predictors were compared across groups. RESULTS: 187/281 patients had either definite- (n = 116) or probable-TB (n = 71). As a rule-in test for definite and probable-TB, LAM identified a similar proportion of TB cases compared to early empiric treatment (85/187 vs. 93/187, p = 0.4), but a greater proportion than classified by a set of clinical predictors alone (19/187; p<0.001). Thirty-nine of the 187 (21%) LAM-positive patients who had either definite- or probable-TB were missed by early empiric treatment, and of these 25/39 (64%) would also have been missed by smear microscopy.

A more differentiated approach at determining the co-occurrence of physical activity and media use behaviors within subjects may be warranted. The aim of this study was to determine the co-occurrence of physical activity and media use by identifying clusters of adolescents with specific behavior patterns including physical activity in various settings (school, sports club, leisure time) and different types of media use (watching TV, playing console games, using PC / Internet). METHODS: Cross-sectional data of 2,083 adolescents (11-17 years) from all over Germany were collected between 2009 and 2012 in the Motorik-Modul Study. Physical activity and media use were self-reported. Cluster analyses (Ward's method and K-means analysis) were used to identify behavior patterns of boys and girls separately. RESULTS: Eight clusters were identified for boys and seven for girls. The clusters demonstrated that a high proportion of boys (33%) as well as girls (42%) show low engagement in both physical activity and media use, irrespective of setting or type of media. Other adolescents are engaged in both behaviors, but either physical activity (35% of boys, 27% of girls) or media use (31% of boys and girls) predominates. These adolescents belong to different clusters, whereat in most clusters either one specific setting of physical activity or a specific combination of different types of media predominates.",

However, there is a paucity of research based on representative data investigating the effects of area-level health services on mortality. This study examines the extent to which municipal health services account for municipal variation in all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. We hypothesise that unfavourable municipal features (eg, fewer available places for rehabilitation) are associated with higher risk of mortality after accounting for patients' characteristics. DESIGN: Population data from Norwegian national/municipal registrars are analysed using multilevel logistic regression in this prospective cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The analytic sample (9412 patients aged 18+ from 336 municipalities) constitutes 87.7% of the nationwide population of Norwegian adults who were hospitalised for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in 2009 and discharged alive.

BACKGROUND: Liver resection offers the only chance of cure for patients with CRLM. Several clinical and pathologic factors have been reported as determinants of poor outcome after hepatectomy for CRLM. A controversial issue is that hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury from HPC may adversely affect long-term outcome by accelerating the outgrowth of residual hepatic micrometastases. METHODS: Patients undergoing liver resection for CRLM in 2 tertiary referral centers, between 1992 and 2008, were included. Disease-free survival and specific liver-free survival were analyzed according to the use, type, and duration of HPC. RESULTS: Five hundred forty-three patients had primary hepatectomy for CRLM.

Hepatic pedicle clamping had a highly significant impact in reducing the risk of blood transfusions and was not correlated with significantly higher postoperative morbidity. Liver recurrence rate was not significantly different according to the use, type, and duration of HPC, in patients resected after preoperative chemotherapy as well. On univariate analysis, HPC did not significantly affect overall and disease-free survival. These results were confirmed on the multivariate analysis where blood transfusions, primary tumor nodal involvement, and the use of preoperative chemotherapy were identified as independent prognostic factors for overall and disease-free survival.",

However, the higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Mexican-origin populations might be related, in part, not to Native American genetic admixture but to Spanish genetic admixture. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Four population-based epidemiological surveys conducted with Mexican-origin and European-origin samples provided data relevant to this question. In all four surveys, type 2 diabetes was defined as fasting plasma glucose>or =7.0 mmol/l or 2-h glucose>or =11.1 mmol/l or use of antidiabetic agents. RESULTS: A comparison of the two Mexican-origin populations showed that the age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of type 2 diabetes was lower in Mexico than in SA-MA (15.1 vs. 17.9%, P = 0.032). Between the two European-origin populations, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes was lower in SA-NHW than in Spain (6.2 vs. 9.1%, P<0.0001), but differences were attenuated by adjustment for BMI or after stratification by education. In logistic regression analyses, type 2 diabetes was associated with Mexican ethnic origin after adjusting for age, education, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio.",

We also explored the role of feelings of insecurity in explaining this relationship. METHODS: Questionnaires were administered to 1104 students (52% boys) from five high schools from the Montreal area (Quebec, Canada) at the beginning, middle, and end of seventh grade. Self report measures included sociodemographic characteristics, victimization, witnessing violence, feelings of insecurity, internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, and measures of engagement, achievement, and truancy as indicators of school adjustment. RESULTS: Witnessing school violence was a comparatively better predictor of subsequent externalizing problems and school adjustment than actual victimization. Conversely, relative to having experienced violence as a witness, actual victimization more reliably estimated later internalizing problems. Feelings of insecurity partially explained the development of school engagement and truancy.",

The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors involved in developing air leaks and the consequences of PAL. METHODS: All patients undergoing lung resection between January 2002 and December 2007 in our hospital were studied retrospectively. Univariate analysis to predict risk factors for developing post-operative air leaks included patient demographics, smoking status, pulmonary function tests, disease aetiology (benign, malignant), neoadjuvant therapy (pre-operative radiotherapy/chemotherapy), extent and type of resection, and different consultant surgeons' practice. A logistic regression model was used for multivariate analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1,911 lung resections were performed over the 6-year study period. An air leak lasting more than 6 days post-operatively was present in 129 patients (6.7%). This included 100 out of the 1,250 patients (8%) from the lobectomy group and 29 out of the 661 patients (4.4%) from the wedge/segmentectomy group. Using the multivariate analysis, the risk factors for developing an air leak included a low predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (pFEV(1)) (p<0.001), performing an upper lobectomy (p=0.002) and different consultant practice (p=0.02).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-eight patients who underwent polysomnography (PSG) between December 2010 and November 2012 consecutively were recruited and they completed the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) questionnaires. Based on the apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI), patients were classified as primary snorers (AHI<5), suffering from mild (5 \u226415), moderate (15 \u226430) or severe OSA (\u226530). RESULTS: Seventy-nine male and 9 female patients with a mean age of 41 years were recruited. OSA patients scored significantly lower on 7 domains of SF-36 compared to the population. As AHI increased, only Physical Function (PF) and Physical Component Summary (PCS) but not ESS scores significantly worsened. PSG parameters correlated poorly with all QOL measures except PF, PCS and ESS. After adjusting for age, sex and body mass index (BMI), multiple linear regression revealed that only the oxygen desaturation parameters, but not sleep architecture indices or AHI were significant predictors of PF and ESS. For every fall in the lowest oxygen saturation (LSAT) by 1%, there was a decrease in PF by 0.59 points, and an increase in ESS by 0.13 points.",

Outcomes considered are monthly professional, outpatient, and inpatient utilization. STUDY DESIGN: We apply an intent-to-treat, instrumental variables analysis using the staggered geographic implementation of MMC to create treatment and control groups of children. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The implementation of MMC reduced monthly professional visits by a smaller degree for non-whites than whites (3.8 percentage points vs. 6.2 percentage points), thereby helping to equalize the initial racial/ethnic disparity in utilization. The Passport MMC program in the Louisville-centered region statistically significantly reduced disparities for professional visits (closing the gap by 8.0 percentage points), while the Kentucky Health Select MMC program in the Lexington-centered region did not.

In addition, tumour volume might be of value in substaging of pathologic tumour stage (pT2) prostate cancer (PCa). OBJECTIVE: To assess the prognostic value of PCa tumour volume. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The cohort consisted of 344 participants in the European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC), Rotterdam section, whose PCa was treated with RP. Mean time of follow-up was 96.2 mo. MEASUREMENTS: Tumour volume was measured in totally embedded RP specimens with a morphometric, computer-assisted method and assessed as a continuous variable, as relative tumour volume (tumour volume divided by prostate volume), and in a binary fashion (\u2265 0.5 ml or<0.5 ml). These variables were related to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression, local recurrence, or distant metastasis and PCa-related mortality using univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses. The analyses were repeated in the subgroup with pT2 tumours. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Tumour volume was related to tumour stage, Gleason score, seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), and surgical margin status. In univariate analyses, tumour volume and relative tumour volume were predictive for all outcome variables. In multivariable analyses, including age, tumour stage, Gleason score, SVI, and surgical margin status, neither tumour volume nor relative volume were independent predictors of progression or mortality. Tumour volume \u2265 0.5 ml was predictive for PSA recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 1.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-2.92) and distant metastasis (HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.02-2.92).",

METHODS: Six cutaneous anthrax patients (mean age: 33.3, SD: 18.1) and six healthy control subjects (mean age: 33.7, SS: 19.6) were examined at the acute phase of the infection with diffusion weighted imaging on 1.5 T scanner. ADC values were measured from five different cerebral locations. T-tests, logistic regression and ROC curves were used. RESULTS: Anthrax patients were significantly different than controls regarding cortical ADC values (p<0.05). Logistic regression model accurately classified five out of the six anthrax cases (83.3%). A cut-off value of 574 mm2/s x 10(-3) was found by using ROC curve coordinates. A sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 67% were attained by means of this value.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to verify if gait speed can be an incremental predictor for mortality and/or major morbidity in combination with EuroSCORE II. METHODS: A single center prospective study cohort of 150 patients aged 70 years or older and undergoing cardiac surgery between August 2012 and April 2013. Slow gait speed was defined as a time taken to walk 5 meters of \u22656 second. The logistic EuroSCORE and EuroSCORE II were used for risk stratification. RESULTS: The studied group had a mean age of 77.7\u00b15.2 years and mean gait speed was 4.9\u00b11.01 (3.0-8.6) seconds. Slow gait speed was recorded in 21 patients (14%), indicated as frail, the other 129 patients (86%) as active. The logistic EuroSCORE risk (P=0.528), was not significantly different between the two groups. The EuroSCORE II risk, however, was significantly higher (P=0.023) for the frail group. There was no mortality and no statistically significant difference in percentage of major morbidity between the frail (28.6%) versus 17.1% for the active group (P=0.209) and slow gait speed could not be identified as independent predictor. Nevertheless frailty demonstrated an incremental value to improve performance of the logistic EuroSCORE model to predict early mortality and/or major morbidity in this elderly patient population. This was not so for EuroSCORE II.",

METHODS: From 1968 to 1985, 117 patients with Stage T3N0 rectal cancer underwent resection with curative intent. No patient received neoadjuvant or adjuvant irradiation or chemotherapy. Surgical specimens were assessed for maximum depth of tumor invasion into perirectal fat, lymphatic or venous involvement, and tumor grade. After surgery the clinical course of these patients was assessed for local control, distant metastases, and survival rate. RESULTS: For 25 patients with tumors exhibiting favorable histologic features (well-differentiated or moderately well-differentiated carcinomas invading less than 2 mm into perirectal fat, without lymphatic or venous vessel involvement), the ten-year actuarial rates of local control and recurrence-free survival were 95 and 87 percent, respectively. In contrast, the ten-year actuarial rates of local control and recurrence-free survival were inferior (71 and 55 percent, respectively) for 88 patients with tumors exhibiting moderate to deep perirectal fat invasion, vessel involvement, or poor differentiation.",

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: PLT concentrates stored for 1 (n = 8) or 8 (n = 7) days were transfused in vitro by means of a pressure inducer (300 mmHg). Samples before and after transfusion were measured for PLT concentration and expression of CD62P, CD63, and PAC-1. These activation markers were measured by flow cytometry on resting PLTs as well as PLTs stimulated with thrombin receptor-activating peptide. Clot generation and strength was examined by TEG by measuring the angle (degree) and maximum amplitude (mm), values that are highly dependent on the PLT function.

Nevertheless, the rate of pancreatic fistula following pancreatic tail resection does not differ between various techniques, still reaching up to 30% in prospective multicentric studies. Taking into account contradictory results concerning the usefulness of covering resection margins after distal pancreatectomy, we sought to perform a systematic, retrospective analysis of patients that underwent distal pancreatectomy at our center. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed the data of 74 patients that underwent distal pancreatectomy between 2001 and 2011 at the community hospital in Neuss. Demographic factors, indications, postoperative complications, surgical or interventional revisions, and length of hospital stay were registered to compare the outcome of patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy with coverage of the resection margins vs. patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy without coverage of the resection margins. Differences between groups were calculated using Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Main indications for pancreatic surgery were insulinoma (n=18, 24%), ductal adenocarcinoma (n=9, 12%), non-single-insulinoma-pancreatogenic-hypoglycemia-syndrome (NSIPHS) (n=8, 11%), and pancreatic cysts with pancreatitis (n=8, 11%). In 39 of 74 (53%) patients no postoperative complications were noted. In detail we found that 23/42 (55%) patients with coverage vs. 16/32 (50%) without coverage of the resection margins had no postoperative complications. The most common complications were pancreatic fistula (n=12, 16%) and pancreatic abscess (n=11, 15%). The mean length of hospital stay was 11.2 days in patients with coverage of the resection margins and 10.2 days in patients without coverage of the resection margins (p=0.001).",

These patients are frequently limited by severe dyspnoea and exertional desaturation. Available guidelines suggest two ISWT are needed; however, this is time consuming and it has not been reported whether a practice ISWT is necessary in ILD. We aimed to investigate if a practice ISWT is needed for patients with ILD referred to PR. METHODS: Patients with ILD who attended a PR assessment performed two ISWT as per standard protocol. Hospital notes were retrieved and relevant data extracted and validated. Endurance shuttle walk test (ESWT) level was calculated at 85% VO2 peak as estimated from the first ISWT (ISWT 1) and second ISWT (ISWT 2). RESULTS: Forty-three patients were included (18 with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis). There was a mean change of 28.84 (31.71) m between the two ISWT (P<0.001) with 72.1% of patients walking further on ISWT 2. A Bland-Altman plot showed good agreement between the ISWTs; however, the limits of agreement were wide. There was a significant difference in ESWT levels (P<0.001) when calculated from ISWT 1 and ISWT 2. ISWT 1 distance, post-ISWT 1 heart rate and baseline Borg breathlessness score were significant variables (P<0.05) in linear regression, but this only explained 42.6% of the variance (R(2) 0.426).",

We assessed the clinical value and need for this procedure. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of pacemaker data and CXRs following permanent pacemaker insertion between December 2002 and February 2004. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Post-procedural CXRs were available in 125/126 consecutive patients after either first endocardial pacemaker implantation or insertion of at least one new lead. Subclavian vein puncture was used for venous access in all cases. CXRs were examined to establish the incidence of pneumothorax and assess pacing lead positions. The clinical records were examined in all patients who had subsequent CXRs or a further pacemaker procedure to identify the indication for these and to establish whether CXR had influenced patient management. RESULTS: In total, 192 post-procedural CXRs were performed, either postero-anterior (PA) and/or lateral views. Ventricular and/or atrial pacing lead contour and electrode position was considered radiographically appropriate in 86% CXRs. Fourteen per cent of post-procedural radiographs were considered to have radiologically sub-optimal pacemaker lead positioning. None of the patients with these \"abnormal\" radiographs experienced subsequent pacemaker complications or had further radiographs recorded at a later date. Later repeat CXRs were performed in 16 patients (13%) but only 3 patients (2%) had pacing abnormalities as the primary indication.

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a common cardiac problem in neonates and infants, but determination of its hemodynamic significance can be challenging. We hypothesized that combined left (LA) and right atrial (RA) volumes physiologically best reflect hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (HSPDA), and utilized two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) derived atrial volumes to test this hypothesis. METHODS: 2DE examinations with good-quality images in 138 neonates<3 months corrected gestational age with PDA, and 50 normal neonates without PDA were selected. Measurements of LA, RA, and combined atrial volumes were performed, in addition to transductal diameters, left atrial to aortic dimension (LA:Ao), and left ventricular end-diastolic to aortic dimension ratios. An experienced cardiologist, blinded to 2DE images of atria and ventricles and to the above measurements, independently assessed HSPDA based only on images and Doppler data of the ductus itself, thus identifying each PDA as of low hemodynamic significance or HSPDA. RESULTS: Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves showed indexed LA volumes and LA/RA volume ratios to have moderate power to discriminate HSPDA from low hemodynamic burden PDA. Classic LA:Ao ratio, combined atrial volumes, and RA volumes yielded ROC areas that appeared less promising as discriminators for HSPDA.",

We tested the feasibility of this policy and determined the prevalence and incidence of maternal depression at well-child visits during the first 6 months of life. METHODS: Providers in an adolescent-oriented maternity program were cued electronically, when they opened the electronic medical records of 0- to 6-month-old infants to conduct well-child visits, to ask the mothers to complete the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale. Incident cases represented mothers who crossed the referral threshold (score of>or =10) after the first screening. RESULTS: Mothers usually brought their infants to the clinic, and none refused screening. Providers could act on 99% of the 418 screening cues; they administered the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale 98% of the time and always referred mothers with scores of>or =10. Overall, 20% of the mothers scored>or =10. Scores were unstable at<or =3 postpartum weeks (kappa = 0.2). Thereafter, the prevalence and incidence of scores of>or =10 decreased from 16.5% at 2 months to 10.3% and 5.7%, respectively, at 4 months.

The following anatomical sites were identified: lip, tongue, and floor of the mouth (simple ranulas), as well as plunging ranulas. The age and gender data of the patients with oral mucoceles were recorded. The HIV status of the patients and other information were reviewed. RESULTS: There were 30 (26.5%) males and 83 (73.5%) females. Most patients were below 30 years of age, with the peak frequency in the first and second decade.

The PRIMA (Can PRo-brain-natriuretic peptide guided therapy of chronic heart failure IMprove heart fAilure morbidity and mortality?) study is, to our knowledge, the first large, prospective randomized study to address whether management of HF guided by an individualized target NT-proBNP level improves outcome. METHODS: A total of 345 patients hospitalized for decompensated, symptomatic HF with elevated NT-proBNP levels at admission were included. After discharge, patients were randomized to either clinically-guided outpatient management (n = 171), or management guided by an individually set NT-proBNP (n = 174) defined by the lowest level at discharge or 2 weeks thereafter. The primary end point was defined as number of days alive outside the hospital after index admission. RESULTS: HF management guided by this individualized NT-proBNP target increased the use of HF medication (p = 0.006), and 64% of HF-related events were preceded by an increase in NT-proBNP.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In the Leukocyte Antibody Prevalence Study (LAPS), 7920 volunteer blood donors were screened for anti-HLA and surveyed about prior pregnancies and transfusions. A secondary analysis of the LAPS database was performed. RESULTS: D- women not more than 40 years old (presumed to have received antenatal with or without postpartum RhIG in all pregnancies) had a significantly lower HLA sensitization rate than D+ women (relative risk, 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40-0.83). When stratified by deliveries (one, two, three, or four or more), D- women not older than 40 were HLA sensitized less often than D+ women in every case. In contrast, a clear relationship between D type and HLA sensitization was not seen in older previously pregnant women whose childbearing years are presumed to have preceded the use of routine RhIG prophylaxis. In a multivariable logistic regression model, D- women not more than 40 years old remained significantly less likely to be HLA sensitized compared with D+ women after adjusting for parity, time from last pregnancy, lost pregnancies, and transfusions (odds ratio [OR], 0.55; 95% CI, 0.34-0.88).",

RESULTS: Of the 302 fourth-year students enrolled at Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Mass, in 1996 and 1997, 223 (74%) completed surveys. Among fourth-year students, 52% rated themselves as unskilled in skin cancer examinations. Twenty-eight percent of fourth-year students had never observed a skin cancer examination, 40% had received no training, and 35% had never practiced the examination. However, fourth-year students reporting at least 1 opportunity to observe, train, or practice an examination were 3 times as likely to report themselves as moderately to very skilled as students without such opportunities.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 1978 to 1987, 292 patients underwent AXRT in the absence of axillary dissection; 126 underwent AXRT following LD. The median dose to the axilla was 46 Gy. The median dose to the supraclavicular fossa was 45 Gy. Among patients found to have positive nodes on LD, adjuvant chemotherapy and tamoxifen were administered to 81% and 7% of subjects, respectively. All patients had potential 8-year follow-up. RESULTS: Six of the 418 patients (1. 4%) developed RNF as a first site of failure within 8 years. Among these 6 patients (1.4%) with RNF as the first site of failure, 4 had simultaneous distant and regional recurrences; and 2 had isolated axillary failures. Three of the 292 patients (1%) with no axillary dissection, none of 84 patients with pathologically negative nodes and 3 of 42 patients (7%) with pathologically involved nodes had RNF as a first site of failure. Radiation pneumonitis developed in 5 patients (1.2%), brachial plexopathy in 5 (1.2%) and arm edema in 4 (1.2%). In all cases, radiation pneumonitis and brachial plexopathy were transient.",

METHODS: In a cross-sectional study of general-population residents in Kilimanjaro, North Tanzania, tea drinking temperatures and times were measured. Using linear regression models, we compared drinking temperatures to those in previous studies, by socio-demographic factors and tea type (\"milky tea\" which can be 50 % or more milk and water boiled together vs \"black tea\" which has no milk). RESULTS: Participants started drinking at a mean of 70.6 \u00b0C (standard deviation 3.9, n = 188), which exceeds that in all previous studies (p \u2264 0.01 for each). Tea type, gender and age were associated with drinking temperatures. After mutual adjustment for each other, milky tea drinkers drank their tea 1.9 \u00b0C (95 % confidence interval: 0.9, 2.9) hotter than drinkers of black tea, largely because black tea cooled twice as fast as milky tea. Men commenced drinking tea 0.9 \u00b0C (-0.2, 2.1) hotter than women did and finished their cups 30 (-9, 69) seconds faster. 70 % and 39 % of milky and black tea drinkers, respectively, reported a history of tongue burning.",

METHODS: We used the data from the 2010 National Survey of Residential Care Facilities conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The outcome was whether an RCF adopted EHR or not, and the predictors were the organizational service innovations including provision of skilled nursing care and medication review. We also added facility characteristics as control variables. Weighted multivariate logistic regressions were used to estimate the relationship between service innovation factors and EHR adoption in the RCFs. RESULTS: In 2010, about 17.4% of the RCFs were estimated to use EHR. Multivariate analysis showed that RCFs employing service innovations were more likely to adopt EHR. The residential care facilities that provide skilled nursing services to their residents are more likely (OR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.09-1.87) to adopt EHR. Similarly, RCFs with a provision of medication review were also more likely to adopt EHR (OR: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.00-1.95).

This study evaluates the association of FVH with infarct morphology, clinical stroke severity and infarct growth in patients with symptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) or middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. METHODS: MR images of 84 patients [median age 73 years (IQR 65-80), 56.0% male, median NIHSS 7 (IQR 3-13)] with acute stroke due to symptomatic ICA or MCA occlusion or stenosis were reviewed. Vessel occlusions were identified by MRA time of flight and graded with the TIMI score. Diffusion and perfusion deficit volumes on admission and FLAIR lesion volumes on discharge were assessed. The presence and number of FVH were evaluated according to MCA-ASPECT areas, and associations with MR volumes, morphology of infarction, recanalization status, presence of white matter disease and hemorrhagical transformation as well as with stroke severity (NIHSS), stroke etiology and thrombolysis rate were analyzed.

PATIENTS: One group of 6 patients with clinical severe ultrafiltration loss and a group of 10 stable CAPD patients without ultrafiltration problems. INTERVENTION: In all patients, two peritoneal permeability tests were done within one week, using glucose 1.36% dialysate on one day and glucose 3.86% on the other day. Dextran 70 was used as a volume marker. RESULTS: The difference in net ultrafiltration between 3.86% glucose and 1.36% glucose dialysate was 569 +/- 51 mL (control) and 153 +/- 103 mL (poor ultrafiltration group; p<0.005). The dialysate/plasma (D/P) concentration ratios increased in both groups with glucose 1.36%. When using 3.86% glucose, the D/P ratio decreased in the control group with a median minimum value one hour after completion of inflow. It is possible that sieving of sodium was due to transcellular water transport by crystalloid osmosis during the hypertonic dwell, as a dissociation between the transport of water and sodium is unlikely to occur in transport through the much larger intercellular pores. The D/P sodium ratio after one hour was related to the mass transfer area coefficient (MTC) of creatinine and the percentage of glucose absorption in the control group. No decrease in D/P ratio was found in the poor ultrafiltration group.",

        "input": "PURPOSE: Prominent hypointense cerebral vessels on susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) and the hyperintense vessel sign (HVS) on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging are considered as markers of compromised tissue perfusion in cerebral ischemia. In this study, we aimed to identify the correlation between HVS on FLAIR and hypointense vessels on SWI, and to determine whether these imaging features provide independent prognostic information in patients with ischemic stroke. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed consecutive ischemic stroke patients with proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion who underwent SWI and FLAIR within 24 h of symptom onset. The presence of hypointense vessels on SWI and hyperintense vessels on FLAIR in>4 of 10 slices encompassing the MCA territory were considered to represent prominent hypoperfusion. RESULTS: Among 50 patients, 62% had a prominent HVS on FLAIR and 68% had prominent hypointense vessels on SWI. There was a moderate but significant correlation between the number of slices with HVS on FLAIR and prominent hypointense vessels on SWI (r=0.425, P = 0.002). In multivariate analyses, the prominence of hypointense vessels on SWI, but not HVS on FLAIR, was significantly associated with a higher discharge NIHSS score (P = 0.027), mRS score (P = 0.021), and lesion growth (P = 0.050).",
        "output": "Prominent hypointense vessels on SWI and HVS on FLAIR are both associated with a higher discharge NIHSS score, mRS score, and lesion growth. However, the presence of prominent hypointense vessels on SWI is a more powerful predictor of poor outcome."

        "input": "BACKGROUND: In Canada and the United States, research has shown that injured patients initially treated at smaller emergency departments before transfer to larger regional facilities are more likely to require longer stays in hospital or suffer greater mortality. It remains unknown whether transport status is an independent predictor of adverse health events among persons requiring care from provincial burn centres. METHODS: We obtained case records from the British Columbia Trauma Registry for adult patients (age \u2265 18 yr) referred or transported directly to the Vancouver General Hospital and Royal Jubilee Hospital burn centres between Jan. 1, 2001, and Mar. 31, 2006. Prehospital and in-transit deaths and deaths in other facilities were identified using the provincial Coroner Service database. Place of injury was identified through data linkage with census records. We performed bivariate analysis for continuous and discrete variables. Relative risk (RR) of prehospital and in-hospital mortality and hospital stay by transport status were analyzed using a Poisson regression model. RESULTS: After controlling for patient and injury characteristics, indirect referral did not influence RR of in-facility death (RR 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54- 3.22) or hospital stay (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.65-1.42). Rural populations experienced an increased risk of total mortality (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.00-1.48).",

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether waiting time in accident and emergency (A&E) departments is shortened when experienced nurses request peripheral limb radiographs before a patient is assessed by a doctor. DESIGN: Simultaneous prospective trial in four A&E departments in the United Kingdom with doctors and nurses requesting radiographs; 2000 patients were randomly allocated to either a \"Nurse First\" or \"Doctor First\" category. SUBJECTS: Patients older than 5 years presenting with recent peripheral limb injuries. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Timing of the various stages of a patient's passage through the A&E department comparing the orthodox route with a group of patients in whom an experienced A&E nurse had the option of requesting a radiograph before a medical assessment. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in the time spent in A&E when no radiograph was requested (P<<0.001). The mean time saved in the \"Doctor First\" (DF) group was 51 min, and in the \"Nurse First\" (NF) group 36 min. For those who were sent for an x ray 14 min was saved by getting the patient to see the nurse first. However, because the overall referral rate for x rays was greater in the NF group, (78% of patients compared with 74% of the DF group, a significant 4% increase (P = 0.05) this potential benefit was largely lost. Overall the average waiting time in the DF group of 92.5 min (95% confidence interval: 89.2 to 96.1 min) was reduced to 88.5 min (95% CI:85.2 to 91.8 min) in the NF group, a non-significant saving of 4 min. There was no overall difference between the proportion of relevant abnormalities reported by the radiologists for the two groups.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether use of 5-ASA was associated with a reduced risk of CRC in these patients. METHODS: We extracted from our population-based University of Manitoba Inflammatory Bowel Disease Epidemiology Database the number of patients with a new diagnosis of CRC between the years 1997 and 2000. From within our Inflammatory Bowel Disease Epidemiology Database we extracted a control group of IBD patients who did not develop CRC matched to the case group who did develop CRC by age, sex, diagnosis, year of diagnosis, and geographic area of residence. We linked cases and controls with Manitoba Health's Drug Program Information Network to study 5-ASA use within 2 yr before CRC diagnosis. The Drug Program Information Network database is a population-based database that was established in 1995 and that records all prescription drugs. RESULTS: There were 25 cases of IBD identified as having CRC. These were matched with 348 cases of IBD who did not develop CRC. CRC cases were more likely to be exposed to 5-ASA (odds ratio = 1.46; 95% CI = 0.58-3.73) but this result was not statistically significant. The mean total days of use was 400.9 days +/- 185.9 among CRC cases versus 420.2 days +/- 241.7 among non-CRC cases (p = 0.92).

OBJECTIVE: To review 29 years of the postgraduate programs in cardiology at the Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo and to analyze master and doctorate graduates' characteristics regarding their origin, publications and subsequent career. METHODS: We developed a questionnaire to evaluate 168 postgraduates who produced 196 theses (116 master's and 80 doctorate) over the period 1975-2004 and contacted 95.9% of them. Information on publications were obtained through the usual science databases. RESULTS: 30% of graduates came from the North-Northeast-Central West regions and only 50% returned to their original area. Mean age at admission was 32.5 and 34.9 years old for master and doctorate students, respectively; average program duration was, respectively, 39.0 and 43.2 months and approximately 50% went through it without any grants.

METHODS: We studied a 50-year-old man with X-linked PHK deficiency using ischemic forearm and cycle ergometry exercise tests to define the derangement of muscle metabolism. We compared our findings with those in patients with McArdle disease and in healthy subjects. RESULTS: Sequencing of PHKA1 showed a novel pathogenic mutation (c.831G>A) in exon 7. There was a normal increase of plasma lactate during forearm ischemic exercise, but lactate did not change during dynamic, submaximal exercise in contrast to the fourfold increase in healthy subjects. Constant workload elicited a second wind in all patients with McArdle disease, but not in the patient with PHK deficiency. IV glucose administration appeared to improve exercise tolerance in the patient with PHK deficiency, but not to the same extent as in the patients with McArdle disease. Lipolysis was higher in the patient with PHK deficiency than in controls.",

We tested the hypothesis that people who believe genetics influence chronic disease risk are less likely to believe lifestyles play a role. METHODS: Open-ended questions about cancer and heart disease risk factors were included in a population-based survey of 1,747 British adults. Responses were coded for causal beliefs about genetics and lifestyle (smoking, diet, alcohol, exercise). RESULTS: One third of the respondents identified genetic factors as influencing cancer (35%) and heart disease (36%) risk. Identifying genetic risk was associated with female gender, older age and education for both diseases, as well as with family history for heart disease. Individuals identifying genetic influences on cancer risk were more likely to identify diet (p<0.001) and exercise (p<0.05), and mentioned more lifestyle factors overall (p<0.05), independent of demographics and family history.

METHODS: Two hundred consecutive patients who underwent stress echocardiography imaging were studied in either fundamental (n = 52) or NTHI mode (n = 148) with an Acuson Sequoia echocardiographic system. Contrast agent (Optison) was administered (0.5 to 1 mL) for enhancement of endocardial borders. Two- and 4-chamber views were analyzed before and after administration of contrast at peak stress for grading of 5 endocardial border segments. Scores from 0 to 5 were assigned to each study for all the images both before and after contrast (0 = 0 segments completely visualized; 5 = 5 segments completely visualized). RESULTS: The use of Optison contrast significantly enhanced border definition when imaging was performed in either fundamental or NTHI mode. Addition of contrast resulted in better endocardial border definition in fundamental mode (4.1 + or - 1.0 versus 2.3 + or - 1.3, P<.001). However, in NTHI mode, the presence of contrast resulted in enhanced definition of endocardial border compared with its absence (4.8 + or - 0.5 versus 3.3 + or - 1.1, P<.001).

It remains unknown whether global supply of FV is sufficient to meet current and growing population needs. We sought to determine whether supply of FV is sufficient to meet current and growing population needs, globally and in individual countries. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used global data on agricultural production and population size to compare supply of FV in 2009 with population need, globally and in individual countries. We found that the global supply of FV falls, on average, 22% short of population need according to nutrition recommendations (supply:need ratio: 0.78 [Range: 0.05-2.01]). This ratio varies widely by country income level, with a median supply:need ratio of 0.42 and 1.02 in low-income and high-income countries, respectively. A sensitivity analysis accounting for need-side food wastage showed similar insufficiency, to a slightly greater extent (global supply:need ratio: 0.66, varying from 0.37 [low-income countries]to 0.77 [high-income countries]). Using agricultural production and population projections, we also estimated supply and need forFV for 2025 and 2050. Assuming medium fertility and projected growth in agricultural production, the global supply:need ratio for FV increases slightly to 0.81 by 2025 and to 0.88 by 2050, with similar patterns seen across country income levels. In a sensitivity analysis assuming no change from current levels of FV production, the global supply:need ratio for FV decreases to 0.66 by 2025 and to 0.57 by 2050.",
        "output": "Global supply of FV falls short of current and projected population need, and this gap is likely to widen in the future. To meet current and future population needs, global FV production must increase substantially."

The incidence of this event has decreased over the years. However, the morbidity, mortality, and causes of UGIB, particularly the etiologic role of Helicobacter pylori infection, are still controversial. Therefore, we prospectively assessed the incidence of UGIB in the intensive care unit (ICU) and evaluated the role of H. pylori infection. DESIGN: A prospective observational study followed by a case-control study. SETTING: Seven ICUs in the Paris area, five of them located in teaching hospitals. PATIENTS: All patients admitted consecutively to seven ICUs during a 1-year period were monitored for signs of clinically relevant UGIB. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Only cases of endoscopically confirmed UGIB were analyzed. Patients whose hemorrhage originated from the stomach and/or duodenum were tested for H. pylori infection, by means of serology, histologic examination, and stool antigen detection. The possible association between H. pylori and UGIB was examined in a case-control study. Twenty-nine of the 4,341 patients admitted to the seven ICUs during the study period had clinically relevant, endoscopically confirmed UGIB (incidence, 0.67%; 95% confidence interval, 0.56%-0.77%). Ulcers were most frequently observed endoscopically. Patients who bled had a higher Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II) at admission (mean +/- sd, 47 +/- 14 vs. 36 +/- 28; P = 0.001) and a higher prevalence of H. pylori infection (71% vs. 44%; P = 0.001). The risk of UGIB was significantly higher in patients with H. pylori infection (odds ratio, 11.3; 95% confidence interval, 2.2-52.2).",

The influence of norepinephrine on cerebral oxygenation is not clear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the infusion of norepinephrine on cerebral oxygenation in healthy subjects. METHODS: Three doses of norepinephrine (0.05, 0.1, and 0.15 microg kg(-1) min(-1) for 20 min each) were infused in nine healthy subjects [six males; 26 (6) yr, mean (SD)]. MAP, cerebral oxygenation characterized by frontal lobe oxygenation (Sc(O2)) and internal jugular venous oxygen saturation (Sjv(O2)), middle cerebral artery mean flow velocity (MCA Vmean), cardiac output (CO), and arterial partial pressure for carbon dioxide (Pa(CO2)) were evaluated. RESULTS: MAP increased from 88 (79-101) [median (range)] to 115 (98-128) mm Hg with increasing doses of norepinephrine (P<0.05), reflecting an increase in total peripheral resistance [20.3 (12.2-25.8) to 25.2 (16.4-28.5) mm Hg min litre(-1); P<0.05] since CO remained at baseline values.

Several tables and nomograms for predicting disease recurrence after definitive therapy provide little or no discrimination between biopsy Gleason sums 4, 5, and 6. We sought to examine the significance of biopsy Gleason sum for predicting biochemical failure following radical prostatectomy (RP) for men with biopsy Gleason sums of 4, 5, and 6. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined data from 988 men treated with RP between 1988 and 2002 who had biopsy Gleason sums of 4-6. Clinical and pathological variables as well as outcome information were compared between men with biopsy Gleason sums of 4-6. The log-rank and Cox proportional hazards analysis were used to determine whether biopsy Gleason sum provided unique prognostic information for men with low biopsy Gleason sums undergoing RP. RESULTS: There was statistically significant, but overall weak correlation between biopsy Gleason sum and Gleason sum of the RP specimen (Spearman's r=0.277, P<0.001). As biopsy Gleason sum increased from 4 to 5 to 6, there was a steady rise (HR=1.31 for each one point increase in Gleason sum, Cox's model) in the risk of PSA failure (P=0.025, log-rank). On multivariate analysis comparing biopsy Gleason sum, preoperative PSA, clinical stage, year of surgery, percent of biopsy cores positive, and age for their ability to predict time to biochemical recurrence, only PSA and biopsy Gleason sum were significant (PSA, HR=1.29, P=0.001; biopsy Gleason sum, HR=1.31, P=0.001).",

        "input": "PURPOSE: This is a retrospective cohort comparison of combined chemotherapy and radiation versus esophagectomy in nonmetastatic esophageal cancers. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1984 and 1994, 82 patients received concurrent chemotherapy and radiation as their primary treatment. Their treatment consisted of 50-60 Gy of radiation in 20-30 fractions over 4-6 weeks, concurrent with bolus mitomycin C (8 mg/m2) on day 1, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) infusion (20 mg/kg/day) +/- leucovorin (20 mg/m2/day) on days 1-4 and 22-25. This group was compared to another cohort of 81 patients who had esophagectomy. Both groups were restaged according to the 1983 AJCC clinical staging system and there was more clinical Stage III disease in the chemoradiation group, 30% versus 16%. RESULTS: The complete response rate was 68% after chemoradiation (by clinical assessment) and 83% for esophagectomy (by pathological assessment). At 5 years, the local relapse rate was 59% for chemoradiation and 51% for esophagectomy. The 5-year disease-free rate and survival were 23% and 25% for chemoradiation, and 21% and 23% for esophagectomy respectively. There was no significant difference in the disease control and survival between the two treatments. The pretreatment AJCC clinical stage was a strong prognosticator of outcome. The 5-year survival was 55% for Stage I, 16% for Stage II, 12% for Stage III, and 11% for Stage IV.",

In Study 2, 44 patients with acute myocardial infarction who randomly received an initial lower dose of either valsartan or losartan after stenting were evaluated. The late loss and decrease in %diameter stenosis in the valsartan group were significantly lower than those in the losartan group as assessed by quantitative coronary angiography after 6 months. In addition, the valsartan group showed a significantly lower expression of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 and L-selectin.",

METHODS: Every patient in a defined geographical area with a potential diagnosis of lung cancer was interviewed at first consultation and after a definitive treatment has been given. Quality of life was assessed using three standard measures: the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), the EORTC quality of life questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and its lung cancer supplementary questionnaire (QLQ-LC13). Comparison was made in quality of life scores between patients who knew their cancer diagnosis and those who did not. RESULTS: In all, 129 lung cancer patients were interviewed. Of these, 30 patients (23%) knew and 99 (78%) did not know their cancer diagnosis at the time of baseline assessment. The patient groups were similar in their characteristics except for age (P = 0.04) and cell type (P<0.0001). Overall, there were no significant differences between these two groups with regard to their scores on the three instruments used. A major finding was that both group scored almost the same on emotional reactions (P = 0.8) and social isolation (P = 1.0) as measured by the NHP, and emotional (P = 0.7) and social functioning (P = 1.0) as measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30.

        "input": "INTRODUCTION: Elderly patients constitute the majority of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The median age of newly diagnosed patients with lung cancer in the United States is approximately 70 years. Despite this, the elderly are significantly underrepresented in clinical trials. This has led to increasing uncertainty as to their optimal treatment. Here, we seek to determine the proportion of elderly patients in key phase III clinical trials in advanced NSCLC. METHODS: A literature search for all phase III trials of systemic therapy for advanced NSCLC between 1980 and 2010 was performed using PubMed. The 100 most highly cited trials were then determined using the \"Web of Science\" application. The inclusion criteria and results of each of these studies were examined for the exclusion of elderly patients, median patient age, and age range. RESULTS: A total of 248 trials were reviewed. Among the 100 most cited trials, 33% specifically excluded elderly patients in their trial design (age exclusion ranged from>65 to>75 years of age). The average-reported patient median age in these trials was 60.9 years. The average age for trials that did not exclude elderly patients was not significantly different at 61.0 (p = 0.97). The average median age of patients was 61 years (95% confidence interval (CI): 60.4-61.6) in all trials.",
        "output": "The majority of phase III clinical trials in advanced NSCLC do not include elderly patients. This is despite the fact that the median age of patients with lung cancer in the United States is approximately 70 years. This is likely due to the fact that the majority of trials are funded by the National Cancer Institute, which has a policy of excluding patients >75 years of age from trials. This policy is not based on any scientific evidence and is not consistent with the current understanding of the biology of lung cancer."

Data regarding patient selection, demographics and mortality rates were extracted. RESULTS: Published international 5-year survival for patients with lung cancer varies from 5% to 16%. The survival figures quoted in the literature are based on data which varies widely in its collection and statistical analysis and this information is not always in the public domain. Data from the US suggests an overall 5-year survival rate of up to 16% although this figure covers only a quarter of the general population and excludes patients without histological confirmation. Many European countries report higher mortality rates although in most, data includes patients without proven histology. European datasets have variable population coverage.",

Our study examined the relationship between two different systems employed to assess academic performance and the levels of stress among students at two different medical schools in Karachi, Pakistan. METHODS: A sample consisting of 387 medical students enrolled in pre-clinical years was taken from two universities, one employing the semester examination system with grade point average (GPA) scores (a tiered system) and the other employing an annual examination system with only pass/fail grading. A pre-designed, self-administered questionnaire was distributed. Test anxiety levels were assessed by The Westside Test Anxiety Scale (WTAS). Overall stress was evaluated using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). RESULTS: There were 82 males and 301 females while four did not respond to the gender question. The mean age of the entire cohort was 19.7 \u00b1 1.0 years. A total of 98 participants were from the pass/fail assessment system while 289 were from the GPA system. There was a higher proportion of females in the GPA system (85% vs. 59%; p<0.01). Students in the pass/fail assessment system had a lower score on the WTAS (2.4 \u00b1 0.8 vs. 2.8 \u00b1 0.7; p = 0.01) and the PSS (17.0 \u00b1 6.7 vs. 20.3 \u00b1 6.8; p<0.01), indicating lower levels of test anxiety and overall stress than in students enrolled in the GPA assessment system.

METHODS: From January, 1995, to August, 1999, 98 cases of pancreatic cystic lesions were evaluated by EUS; all of these were originally imaged by cross-sectional modalities that were not diagnostic. Among these, surgical/pathological correlation was available in 48 patients. The original endosonographic images were reviewed by two endosonographers who were blinded to each other's interpretation and to the surgical and pathological interpretation. The EUS images were assessed for the presence or absence of the following characteristics: 1) wall, 2) solid component, 3) septae, 4) lymphadenopathy, and 5) number of cysts. These characteristics were then correlated with the surgical and pathological findings and were assessed to determine if any were predictors of the lesion being benign or malignant. RESULTS: For reviewer A, the presence of a solid component by EUS was the only statistically significant predictor of malignancy (odds ratio = 4.73, 95% CI = 1.13-19.68, p = 0.03). However, 61% of patients with benign lesions were also interpreted by EUS to have a solid component. For reviewer B, none of the features were found to be significant predictors of a malignant lesion.

There are large gender differences in alcohol-related mortality rates in Scotland and in other countries, but the reasons for these differences are not clearly understood. In this paper, we aimed to address calls in the literature for further research on gender differences in the causes, contexts and consequences of alcohol-related harm. Our primary research question was whether the kind of social environment which tends to produce higher or lower rates of alcohol-related mortality is the same for both men and women across Scotland. METHODS: Cross-sectional, ecological design. A comparison was made between spatial variation in men's and women's age-standardised alcohol-related mortality rates in Scotland using maps, Moran's Index, linear regression and spatial analyses of residuals. Directly standardised mortality rates were derived from individual level records of death registration, 2000-2005 (n = 8685). RESULTS: As expected, men's alcohol-related mortality rate substantially exceeded women's and there was substantial spatial variation in these rates for both men and women within Scotland. However, there was little spatial variation in the relationship between men's and women's alcohol-mortality rates (r2 = 0.73); areas with relatively high rates of alcohol-related mortality for men tended also to have relatively high rates for women. In a small number of areas (8 out of 144) the relationship between men's and women's alcohol-related mortality rates was significantly different.",

Erosion into the gastric wall by these devices remains a problem. A soft resiliant prosthesis of animal origin, constituted by a network of non-absorbable collagen fibres, may be a solution to this problem. This study assessed, in a porcine model, the histological reaction of the gastric wall following apposition of a band of porcine collagen (Pelvicol, Bard). METHODS: 15 female pigs weighing on average 21 kg underwent vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG). Stoma control was achieved with a band of porcine collagen (2 cm wide, 7 cm long and 2 mm thick). The pigs were sacrificed 1 month after VBG, and histological analysis was performed at a macroscopic and microscopic level. RESULTS: There was no peri-operative death, although 2 pigs died in the postoperative period (the first case developed a bowel fistula and sepsis, and the second pig died of unrelated causes). There were 2 additional morbidities (gastric fistula on the linear staple-line away from the Pelvicol band) that led to an early euthanasia of 2 pigs. Post-mortem macroscopic analyses in the remaining 11 pigs did not reveal migration of the device, and there was no tissue reaction on postoperative microscopic analyses. 10 of the pigs had lost weight at 1 month, averaging 3.42 kg.",

In the last years it has become a fact that tumor growth is angiogenesis-dependent. Therefore, inhibitors of angiogenesis are a new class of antineoplastic substances with a novel mechanism of action that might be a powerful complement to conventional cytostatic therapy. SUBSTANCES AND CLINICAL TRIALS: Inhibitors of tumor-angiogenesis which have entered clinical trials, with their results published until December 1998 are discussed here. Most results originate from phase-I or phase-II clinical trials. They are discussed and compared in respect to toxicity and response. Also some substances with high therapeutic potential which are still in preclinical testing are discussed. RESULTS: Many of the investigated angiogenesis inhibitors demonstrated anti-tumor effects in phase-I or phase-II clinical trials. The commonest manifestation was stable disease, followed by partial remissions. In a few cases, complete remissions were observed. The toxicities of these substances differ both in type and degree of side effects.",

Recently, lymph node ratio (LNR) has been described as a predictor of survival in patients with HNSCC. The purpose of this study was to evaluate to which degree LNR could be used as a more accurate predictor than TNM staging? METHODS: A total of 291 patients, with a follow-up of at least 3\u00a0years, were analyzed using log-rank statistic, univariate and multivariate data analyzes, and p values, for prediction of lymph node ratio on overall and recurrence-free survival. RESULTS: Survival differed significantly if patients were stratified for LNR. Impact of LNR on survival was significantly different even in patients with extracapsular spread. Patients with pN0 had no survival benefit compared with patients with pN1 or higher with a LNR lower than 6\u00a0%.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: A recent meta-analysis based on data from>7,000 pregnancies reported an association between prenatal polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-153 exposure and reduced birth weight. Gestational weight gain, which is associated negatively with PCB levels in maternal and cord blood, and positively with birth weight, could substantially confound this association. OBJECTIVE: We sought to estimate the influence of gestational weight gain on the association between PCB-153 exposure and birth weight using a pharmacokinetic model. METHODS: We modified a recently published pharmacokinetic model and ran Monte Carlo simulations accounting for variability in physiologic parameters and their correlations. We evaluated the pharmacokinetic model by comparing simulated plasma PCB-153 levels during pregnancy to serial measurements in 10 pregnant women from another study population. We estimated the association between simulated plasma PCB-153 levels and birth weight using linear regression models. RESULTS: The plasma PCB-153 level profiles generated with the pharmacokinetic model were comparable to measured levels in 10 pregnant women. We estimated a 118-g decrease in birth weight (95% CI: -129, -106 g) for each 1-\u03bcg/L increase in simulated cord plasma PCB-153, compared with the 150-g decrease estimated based on the previous meta-analysis. The estimated decrease in birth weight was reduced to -6 g (95% CI: -18, 6 g) when adjusted for simulated gestational weight gain.",

We hypothesized that stimulus-induced rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) could be classified as ictal and interictal using single-photon emission computerized tomographic (SPECT) imaging to help guide aggressive or deescalate anticonvulsant management. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all cases of ICU patients at a single center, tertiary care academic center for evidence of SIRPIDs with concomitant SPECT imaging over a one year period. RESULTS: From 2011 to 2012, we retrospectively identified 2 of 235 intensive care unit EEGs-completed patients (both 20 minutes and continuous EEG), who had SIRPIDs who subsequently underwent SPECT imaging. Both patients were female, one aged 63 years who had aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and large intraparenchymal hematoma and the other aged 67 years who sustained a cardiac arrest. Continuous EEG in both demonstrated stimulation-provoked SIRPIDs within 6 to 8 days of hospitalization. A SPECT scan using technetium-hexamethylporpyleneamineoxime (HMPAO) performed during stimulation induced SIRPIDs on EEG, followed by a SPECT scan without SIRPIDs on EEG. In both patients, regional cerebral hyperperfusion was not present between the two SPECT scans. The absence of hyperperfusion on either scan and subtracted SPECT imaging helped reduce aggressive anticonvulsant use, infusion of propofol, or ventilator settings.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: DVT was induced in both hind limbs of five pigs. Thirty minutes later, bilateral thrombolysis was performed by using infusion guidewires placed coaxially through occlusion balloon catheters. A temporary venous filter was then placed in the inferior vena cava. The balloon catheters and infusion wire were removed, a 14-F sheath was placed on the right side, and aspiration of residual thrombi was attempted with 8- and 6-F catheters. At autopsy, the mass of any thrombus in the iliofemoral veins was measured, and residual thrombosis in the venous tributaries was graded at four sites. Thromboemboli in the inferior vena cava and the pulmonary circulation were also collected and weighed. RESULTS: With aspiration and lysis, the iliofemoral veins were cleared of thrombus in three of five limbs; from the remaining two, only 0.09 and 0.15 g of thrombus were harvested. Except for the deep femoral vein in two legs, tributaries were free of thrombus. After thrombolysis alone, thrombi ranged in mass from 0.54 to 1.14 g (median, 0.70 g). Some thrombi were observed in most tributaries. One or two small emboli were found trapped by the caval filter and in the pulmonary circulation in four and three pigs, respectively.",

However, little is known about potential patients' preferences for surgical care provision. The aim of this study was to investigate the general public's preferences towards location and other attributes of surgical treatment. METHODS: An economic evaluation technique, discrete choice analysis, was administered in a survey to a sample of a German general public Internet panel, representative in terms of age, gender and education. Responders were asked to choose their preferred provider of surgical care in a series of pairwise choices, defined by five attributes. Regression analysis was used to quantify preferences towards characteristics of care and to calculate utilities of treatment scenarios. The strength of preferences and the rate at which participants were willing to trade among attributes were estimated. RESULTS: The response rate was 76% (n=1134). 'Specialization and experience of provider' was the single most important attribute, followed by 'waiting times' and 'staff continuity'. Subjects traded a 4-week waiting time to obtain surgery at a highly specialized institution. Responders favoured outpatient clinics over office-based and inpatient surgery, but 'location of care' preferences were only weak.

There were concerns that this perverse incentive was a key cause of irrational medicine use. China's new Essential Medicines Program (EMP) was launched in 2009 as part of the national health sector reform initiatives. One of its core policies was to eliminate primary care providers' economic incentives to overprescribe or prescribe unnecessarily expensive drugs, which were regarded as consequences of China's traditional financing system for health institutions. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to measure changes in prescribing patterns in primary healthcare facilities after the removal of the economic incentives for physicians to overprescribe as a result of the implementation of the EMP. METHODS: A comparison design was applied to 8,258 prescriptions in 2007 and 8,278 prescriptions in 2010, from 83 primary healthcare facilities nationwide. Indicators were adopted to evaluate medicine utilization, which included overall number of medicines, average number of Western and traditional Chinese medicines, pharmaceutical expenditure per outpatient prescription, and proportion of prescriptions that contained two or more antibiotics. We further assessed the use of medicines (antibiotics, infusion, hormones, and intravenous injection) per disease-specific prescription for hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery heart disease, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and gastritis. A difference-in-difference analysis was employed to evaluate the net policy effect. RESULTS: Overall changes in indicators were not found to be statistically significant between the 2 years. The results varied for different diseases. The number of Western drugs per outpatient prescription decreased while that of traditional Chinese medicines increased. The proportion of prescriptions containing two or more antibiotics decreased significantly. The use of antibiotics, infusion, hormones, and intravenous injection per disease-specific prescription decreased significantly.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cardiac computed tomography imaging was performed on a 40-row MDCT scanner. Myocardial attenuation was assessed in 50 men during 20 cardiac phases. Ninety myocardial regions of interest were placed in the distribution of the right, left anterior descending, and left circumflex coronary arteries on contrast-enhanced MDCT. In 26 patients, myocardial attenuation was also assessed on non-contrast-enhanced MDCT. Myocardial attenuation was analyzed on isopycnic graphs. Attenuation changes due to myocardial contraction were evaluated on non-contrast-enhanced MDCT. The impact of cyclic perfusion on myocardial enhancement was determined on contrast-enhanced MDCT. Student t test and Pearson correlation were used. The influence of dominant coronary perfusion type, supplying coronary artery, and cardiac phase were evaluated using univariate general linear model analysis. RESULTS: Isopycnic graphs revealed that myocardial contraction during systole led to significant increase in myocardial attenuation on non-contrast-enhanced MDCT [ HU systole = 33.2 vs HU diastole = 29.1, P<0.001]. Reduction in myocardial perfusion during systole led to decrease in myocardial attenuation on contrast-enhanced MDCT [ HU systole = 32.2 vs HU diastole = 34.2, P<0.001].

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the timing of causative drug withdrawal is related to the prognosis of patients with toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) or Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS). DESIGN: A 10-year observational study (January 1, 1987, through October 30, 1997) of patients admitted to a dermatological intensive care unit, using binary logistic regression analysis. SETTING: A single referral unit in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Consecutive sample of 203 patients with TEN or SJS. Exclusion criteria included causative drug undetermined, lack of information on disease evolution, the date of causative drug(s) withdrawal, or the date when the first definite sign of TEN or SJS appeared. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Death before hospital discharge. RESULTS: One hundred thirteen patients were included; 74 had TEN and 39 had SJS; 20 died. The drug causing TEN or SJS was withdrawn early in 64 patients and late (after the first definite sign of TEN or SJS) in 49 patients. After adjustment for confounding variables (age, maximum extent of detachment, admission year, human immunodeficiency virus status), our model showed that the earlier the causative drug was withdrawn, the better the prognosis (odds ratio, 0.69 for each day; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-0.89).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From July 1992 to March 1999, DCIS without invasion was diagnosed by means of SCNB in 59 patients. Seventeen (29%) were found to have invasive disease after surgery. The underestimation rate for SCNB was compared with that obtained by means of open surgical biopsy. Mammographic and histologic features of cases with and those without invasion were compared. RESULTS: All patients had calcifications on mammograms. There was no significant difference (P: =.26) between the underestimation rate for SCNB with the 11-gauge vacuum-assisted device and that for open surgical biopsy. No statistically significant differences between cases with and those without invasion were seen in patient age, mean number of core specimens, level of suspicion, size of lesion, distribution and morphology of the calcifications, presence of an associated mass or density, subtype of DCIS, nuclear grade, or presence of necrosis or desmoplasia.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Mesenteric ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) is a common problem in critically ill patients and is frequently associated with myocardial dysfunction. Several potential mechanisms have been proposed to be involved in the myocardial dysfunction associated with mesenteric I/R, including nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappaB)-mediated tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) release leading to cardiodepression. Thus, we sought to investigate the effect of NF kappaB inhibition on mesenteric I/R-associated myocardial dysfunction in a large animal model (dog). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 21 mongrel dogs were anesthetized and mechanically ventilated. Animals were instrumented with a Swan-Ganz Catheter, left ventricle (LV) pressure manometer, and ultrasonic crystals. Mesenteric I/R consisted of 60 min of ischemia followed by 180 min of reperfusion. Seven animals received pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC, 100 mg/kg) prior to mesenteric I/R (I/R PDTC). Another group of animals (n = 7) without mesenteric ischemia received PDTC following baseline measurements and served as control for the effect of PDTC alone (PDTC). Preload recruitable stroke work, +/-dp/dt(max), isovolumic relaxation (tau), and cardiac output were measured. Myocardial tissue was analyzed for NF kappaB activity, TNF-alpha production, and myocardial apoptosis. RESULTS: Mesenteric I/R impaired both LV systolic and diastolic function. Administration of PDTC worsened the LV dysfunction associated with mesenteric I/R. PDTC did not affect the baseline LV function. NF kappaB activity was increased in the mesenteric I/R group compared with the control group. TNF-alpha production was increased in the mesenteric I/R group compared with the control group. Myocardial apoptosis was increased in the mesenteric I/R group compared with the control group.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data for this analysis came from 2 phase III trials: the TARGIT (Targeted Intraoperative Radiotherapy) trial and the ELIOT (Electron Intraoperative Radiotherapy) trial. Cost analyses included a cost-minimization analysis and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio analysis including a quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) analysis. Cost analyses were performed comparing IORT with WBI delivered using 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), APBI 3D-CRT, APBI delivered with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), APBI single-lumen (SL), APBI multilumen (ML), and APBI interstitial (I). RESULTS: Per 1000 patients treated, the cost savings with IORT were $3.6-$4.3 million, $1.6-$2.4 million, $3.6-$4.4 million, $7.5-$8.2 million, and $2.8-$3.6 million compared with WBI 3D-CRT, APBI IMRT, APBI SL, APBI ML, and APBI I, respectively, with a cost decrement of $1.6-$2.4 million compared with APBI 3D-CRT based on data from the TARGIT trial.

Factors predicting durable fixation are not clearly understood, but we presumed bone ingrowth could be enhanced by the quantity of host bone and application of autograft bone chips.QUESTIONS/ PURPOSES: We asked: (1) Did the amount of bone ingrowth exceed the amount of periprosthetic and host bone with the addition of autograft bone chips? (2) Did the amount of bone ingrowth increase with implantation time? And (3) did osteolysis along the porous-coated interface and screw tracts progress with implantation time? METHODS: We measured the amount of bone in the porous-coated, periprosthetic, and host bone regions in 19 postmortem retrieved cementless primary total knee implants. The amount of bone in apposition to the implant surface, and alternatively lysed bone, was analyzed radiographically to assess the progression of osteolysis. RESULTS: While bone ingrowth tended to be less than periprosthetic and host bone in all three components, it was only significantly less in the patellar component. Bone ingrowth increased in all three components over time, but progression of osteolysis did not.",

Radical trachelectomy in combination with pelvic lymph node dissection (RVT + LPL) has emerged as an alternative to radical hysterectomy (RH) for these patients who desire preservation of fertility. However, there are limited data to support its efficacy and safety. METHODS: All patient information was collected prospectively and was subsequently extracted from the cervical cancer surgery database of the Division of Gynecologic Oncology at the University of Toronto. Patients treated by RVT + LPL for fertility preservation were compared with two groups of patients treated by RH. One control group was matched for age, tumor size, histology, depth of invasion, presence of capillary lymphatic space involvement, lymph node metastases, and use of adjuvant radiation. The other control group consisted of patients with tumor sizes</=2 cm, negative pelvic lymph nodes who had not received adjuvant radiation therapy. RESULTS: Thirty of 32 patients treated by RVT + LPL between March 1994 and November 1998 were matched. The only statistically significant difference in prognostic factors between the patients who underwent RVT + LPL and unmatched controls (556 patients) was the median depth of invasion in the adenocarcinomas (2. 0 mm vs. 4.0 mm, respectively; P<0.02). The 2-year actuarial recurrence free survival was 95%, 100%, and 97% for the patients who underwent RVT + LPL, matched controls, and unmatched controls, respectively.

However, it is not known whether even occasional victimization has similar negative consequences and whether protective factors such as social support may prevent those harmful developments. The present study therefore focuses on the nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidal behavior (SB) in victims of bullying and the potentially moderating effect of parental monitoring. METHODS: In all, a cross-sectional sample of 647 adolescents (mean age 12.8 years) were surveyed concerning bullying experiences, NSSI and SB, and parental monitoring. RESULTS: A total of 14.4% of respondents reported being a victim of frequent bullying in the past few months (with verbal and social bullying playing the most important role), which increased the risks of both NSSI (OR\u2009=\u200911.75) and SB (OR\u2009=\u20096.08). This relationship could also be shown for occasional victims of bullying (35.6%), although to a lesser extent.

However, a less invasive procedure, such as ultrasound (US) -guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), would be preferred. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of US-guided FNAC and compare the results with histology after SN surgery was performed in all patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred consecutive patients who underwent lymphoscintigraphy subsequently underwent a US examination before the SN procedure. When the US examination showed a suspicious or malignant pattern, patients underwent an FNAC. Median Breslow thickness was 1.8 mm; mean follow-up was 42 months (range, 4 to 82 months). We considered the US-guided FNAC positive if either US and/or FNAC were positive. If US was suggestive of abnormality, but FNAC was negative, the US-guided FNAC was considered negative. RESULTS: US-guided FNAC identified 51 (65%) of 79 SN metastases. Specificity was 99% (317 of 321), with a positive predictive value of 93% and negative predictive value of 92%. SN-positive identification rate by US-guided FNAC increased from 40% in stage pT1a/b disease to 79% in stage pT4a/b disease.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified all renal masses resected at our institution between 1 December 1999, and 1 October 2005. The size of tumour, patient age and gender were compared between those with and without malignancy on final pathology. The influence of these variables in predicting malignancy, high grade, and high stage were assessed by univariate and multivariate analysis using logistic regression models, with a significance level of P<0.05. Subsets were analysed for the groups of patients with tumours of \u2264 3 or>3 cm and those aged \u2264 75 or>75 years. RESULTS: Among 466 of 501 patients with evaluable data, univariate analysis showed that both male gender and increasing size positively predicted malignancy (odds ratio 1.13 and 1.40, respectively), but age, treated as a continuous variable, did not. On multivariate analysis both remained independent predictors of malignancy (odds ratio 1.13 and 1.40, respectively). Size was the only independent predictor of high-stage and high-grade disease on both univariate and multivariate analysis. Among 156 patients with tumours of \u2264 3 cm, on multivariate analysis, male gender was only weakly associated with the risk of malignancy, whereas size remained strongly predictive (odds ratio 1.98, P = 0.076; and 2.16, P = 0.015, respectively).

Prior to viewing the videotape, participants were randomly allocated to one of three conditions and were given the following information about the patient: (a) general background information; (b) additional descriptive information about behaviour corresponding to BPD; and (c) additional descriptive information about behaviour corresponding to BPD, but explicitly adding BPD as a possible comorbid diagnostic label. All participants were then asked to note things they had seen in the videotape that made them feel optimistic or pessimistic about treatment outcome. RESULTS: Participants in the group that were explicitly informed that the patient had a BPD diagnostic label reported significantly fewer reasons to be optimistic than the other two groups.",

METHODS: Prescription pattern of elderly (65-79\u2009years) and very elderly (>79\u2009years) patients in three different health-care settings [hospitals, general practitioners, and long-term care facilities (LTCFs)] was assessed in March 2014, and PIPs were assessed according to the Beers criteria. Other situations at potentially high risk were checked. RESULTS: A total of 1582 patients (hospital, n\u2009=\u2009528; outpatients, n\u2009=\u2009527; nursing homes, n\u2009=\u2009527) were included. Very elderly were more represented in hospitals (60.4%) and LTCFs (77.1%) than among general practitioners (37.6%). Polypharmacy and hyperpolypharmacy rates ranged 57.7-73.7% and 9.7-15.6%, respectively. The most frequently prescribed drugs were the proton pump inhibitors, whereas the most common PIPs resulted the benzodiazepines. Multinomial regression analysis showed that female sex, age\u2009>\u200979\u2009years, hyperpolypharmacy, and chronic kidney disease were associated with the risk of having \u22652 PIPs. Two situations at high risk of PIPs were identified: the use of proton pump inhibitors and the use of benzodiazepines in combination with other hypnotics.",

Our aim was to evaluate in patients with acute pancreatitis the effect of enteral nutrition by a semi-elemental formula compared with a polymeric formula. METHODS: A randomized prospective pilot study, stratified according to severity, was performed in 30 consecutive patients with acute pancreatitis requiring jejunal nutrition. The semi-elemental group received 35 kcal/kg/d of Peptamen (n = 15), and the polymeric group received the same quantity of Sondalis-Iso (n = 15). Tolerance was evaluated after 7 days of enteral nutrition (D7) on visual analog scale (VAS), stool frequency, and 24-hour steatorrhea/creatorrhea. Outcome was evaluated by weight loss, length of hospital stay, and infection rate. RESULTS: Results were calculated as mean +/- SEM, t-test, or chi2. Patients of the 2 groups were comparable in terms of age, gender, and severity. Tolerance was good in both groups (semi-elemental vs polymeric: VAS, 7.4 +/- 0.6 vs 7.1 +/- 0.6, not significant (NS); number of stools per 24 hours, 1.7 +/- 0.4 vs 1.8 +/- 0.4, NS).

METHODS: Seventy patients undergoing RBA for cataract surgery were enrolled in a prospective, double-blind trial. They were allocated randomly to receive 5 ml either warm (37 degrees C) or cold (20 degrees C) anesthetic solution for RBA. Additionally, O'Brien's method was used to create an akinesia of the orbicularis oculi muscle. The following data were collected before and 20 minutes after retrobulbar injection: pain of injection, eye motility (Kestenbaum test), and corneal sensitivity (0: no sensitivity; 1: sensitivity remaining) at four different sites. The pain of injection was registered using an ordinal analogous scale before and immediately after the injection. Furthermore, data acquisition included any possible side effects and the bulbar length, measured with ultrasound.

More information is needed about whether they are true risk factors and independently predict the development of suicidal ideation. METHOD: A sample of the general population from Eastern Finland (n = 1,339) was followed-up for three-years with baseline and two follow-up assessments using postal questionnaires. The main adverse life events and changes in lifestyles were screened at baseline and on one- and three-year follow-up. The Beck Depression Inventory was used to assess the level of depression and the presence of suicidal ideation. RESULTS: Suicidal ideation was common in the sample (annual incidence 4.3%). At baseline it associated with a cluster of adverse life events and lifestyles, as well as depression. Nevertheless, only the Beck Depression Inventory score on 3-year follow-up (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.22-1.45) and the onset of daily smoking during the follow-up period (OR 5.38, 95% CI 1.41-20.62) independently predicted the presence of suicidal ideation on 3-year follow-up among those who had been non-suicidal at baseline and on 1-year follow-up.",

METHODS: Obesity was induced in 24 3-week-old Sprague Dawley pups fed a high-energy diet (HED). Three groups (n = 8/group) were studied: RYGB, sham-operated pair-fed, and sham-operated ad libitum HED. Controls were nonobese rats fed chow (n = 6). Rats were killed 10 days after operation, and blood was collected to measure corticosterone and SAF and mesenteric fat to measure IL-6, TNF-alpha, and corticosterone.

A number of different therapies are prescribed to control the disease. This survey-based study was carried out to assess patients' and physicians' perceptions of GERD and its treatment. METHODS: Randomly selected general practitioners (GPs) from five countries (USA, UK, Japan, Germany and France) took part in a faceto-face interview, using a standard questionnaire, concerning the last four GERD patients (those taking GERD medication) who had consulted them and who consented to be interviewed. Those patients were then interviewed via telephone, also using a standard questionnaire. RESULTS: Completed questionnaires were available for 927 of the 1044 patients who were identified. The mean length of time that patients suffered GERD symptoms prior to consultation was more than 1.5 years, with 52.3% of those consulting a GP stating the reason they sought medical attention was that 'symptoms were too uncomfortable to bear'. Only 36% of patients receiving prescription therapy reported that they were currently asymptomatic; 20.5% of patients were also taking at least one over-the-counter (OTC) medication.",

        "input": "OBJECTIVES: This work aims to test the hypothesis that the funniest comedians are most at risk of a premature death and reduced longevity compared to their relatively less funny counterparts. METHODS: A retrospective longitudinal cohort study with a nested case-control analysis of longevity of 53 male British comedians born between 1900 and 1954 was conducted. All comedians were given a subjective score from 1 (relatively funny) to 10 (hilariously funny) by the study investigators. The survival profile of all comedians was then examined adjusting for decade of birth, whether they worked in a comedy team and their comedy score. A nested case-control analysis examined the longevity of those comedians working in teams according to their pre-specified status within the team (straight/less funny versus funny team member). RESULTS: On an adjusted basis, there was no correlation between the decade of birth (HR 0.94, 95% 0.65 to 1.38 per incremental decade; p=0.763) and comedy team status (HR 1.13, 95% 0.51 to 2.48 versus independent comedian; p=0.761) with longevity. However, an increasingly funny comedy score was associated with increased mortality (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.44 per unit funny score; p=0.006). Of the 23 comedians adjudged to be very funny (score 8-10), 18 (78%) had died versus 12 (40%) of the rest; mean age at death 63.3\u00b112.2 versus 72.3\u00b114.7 (p=0.079). Within comedy teams, those identified as the funnier member(s) of the partnership had a significantly reduced survival profile (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.70; p=0.039).",

In countries such as the USA, the economic impact of COPD exceeds that of many chronic conditions. There is a paucity of data on the economic burden of COPD in Japan. METHODOLOGY: Based upon publicly available information, a prevalence-based approach was used to construct a deterministic model to estimate the total direct and indirect costs of care for COPD in Japan. Data sources included a spirometry-based epidemiological study, the peer-reviewed literature, and governmental and industrial surveys. The most current data that addressed direct and indirect costs of care were utilized. RESULTS: In Japan, the estimated total cost of COPD is 805.5 billion yen (US 6.8 billion dollars) per year; 645.1 billion yen (US 5.5 billion dollars) in direct costs and 160.4 billion yen (US 1.4 billion dollars) in indirect costs. In direct costs, inpatient care accounted for 244.1 billion yen (US 2.1 billion dollars), outpatient care 299.3 billion yen (US 2.5 billion dollars), and home oxygen therapy 101.7 billion yen (US 0.9 billion dollars). The average annual total cost per patient for moderate/severe COPD is estimated to be 435,876 yen (US 3694 dollars); 349,080 yen (US 2958 dollars) per COPD patient in direct costs and 86,797 yen (US 795 dollars) in indirect costs.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the predictive value of peri- and intra-operative factors, and more specifically of the pre-operative American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score on functional outcome in these patients. METHODS: A questionnaire designed to assess pre-fracture functional and health status was administered to surgically treated hip fracture patients. Post-fracture functional and health status was further ascertained by in-home interview one year after the operation. Among 140 consecutive eligible patients older than 65 years, 10 either refused subsequent interviews or could not be contacted; an additional 16 patients died during the year of follow-up, leaving 114 patients available for this study. RESULTS: The average age of the patients was 82.4 years. Almost two-thirds of them suffered from severe systemic disease, whether or not incapacitating (ASA grades III-IV). Subjects classified in these categories presented more frequently with cardiovascular disorders, were more frequently disoriented, and already had some pre-fracture difficulty with ambulation. The mortality at one year was almost nine times higher in severely impaired patients (grades III-IV) than in healthy or mildly affected patients (grades I-II). Functional outcome and/or ambulatory ability assessed at one year did not reveal any statistically significant difference between the ASA I-II and III-IV groups. The most pronounced difference was noticed for the functional independence measured by the ADL score (p = 0.236). Better prognoses were consistently recorded for patients with an ASA score of 2 or 3.",

Nevertheless, the relationship between ICAS and procedure-related stroke in isolated aortic valve replacement is unclear. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients with artery stenosis who underwent ICAS screening before surgical (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) between January 2007 and August 2014. Logistic regression models were used to determine the relation between post-procedure stroke and total (sum of left and right ICAS) and maximal unilateral ICAS. Age, sex, history of atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular disease and diabetes, left ventricular ejection fraction, and procedure type were considered as covariates. Two-subgroup analyses were performed in patients who underwent TAVR and SAVR, adjusting for procedure specific details. RESULTS: A total of 996 patients underwent ICAS screening before TAVR (n\u00a0= 467) or SAVR (n\u00a0= 529). The prevalence of at least \u226570% ICAS was 5.2% (n\u00a0= 52) and incidence of 30-day stroke was 3.4% (n\u00a0= 34).

DESIGN: Cross-section survey. SETTING: Sydney, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: 269 regular illicit psychostimulant users. MEASUREMENTS: Structured interview assessing demographics, drug use and treatment history, psychostimulant dependence and self-reported symptoms consistent with adult ADHD. FINDINGS: Almost half (45%) screened positive for adult ADHD (ADHD+). Symptoms of inattention (90%) were more prevalent than symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity (57%). Of those who screened positive for adult ADHD, only 17% had received a prior diagnosis of ADHD. The ADHD+ group differed from other participants in several respects: an earlier initiation of substance use and injecting drug use; more extensive polydrug use; a higher frequency of recent stimulant use and injecting drug use; a greater likelihood of stimulant dependence; and a greater likelihood of having received treatment for drug dependence. After controlling for other factors, screening positive for ADHD was associated independently with fewer years of education, earlier initiation of regular tobacco use and more extensive life-time polydrug use.",

We discuss the validity of conservative therapy for thrombosed type A dissection and examine the relationship between the morphology of the dissecting aorta and its operative indications. METHODS: Subjects were 28 patients with acute type A aortic dissection in which the false lumen was totally thrombosed who were transferred to our hospital in the acute phase between 1990 and 2002. We performed medical therapy on all of them at first. We calculated the ratio of the false lumen and the true lumen (F/T) by enhanced computed tomography scan at the onset. The maximum aneurysmal size was measured approximately every week. RESULTS: Fifteen of them needed surgical repair; six in the acute phase and nine in chronic. One-year and 5-year survival rate for the operative and the non-operative group are 93.3, 80.0 and 92.3, 92.3% respectively.

OBJECTIVE: To assess retraction pressure and the exposure of pharyngeal/esophageal (P/E) wall to the medial retractor blade to clarify whether medial retraction causes direct pressure transmission to the P/E wall. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Retraction pressure on P/E walls has been used to explain the relation between the retraction pressure and dysphagia or the efficacies of new retractor blades. However, it is doubtful whether the measured pressure represent real retraction pressure on the P/E wall because exposure of the P/E in the surgical field could be reduced by the shielding effect of thyroid cartilage. METHODS: Epi- and endoesophageal pressures were serially measured using online pressure transducers 15 minutes before retraction, immediately after retraction, and 30 minutes after retraction. To measure the extent of P/E wall exposure to pressure transducer, we used posterior border of thyroid cartilage as a landmark. Intraoperative radiograph was used to mark the position of the posterior border of thyroid cartilage. We checked out the marked location on retractors by measuring the distance from distal retractor tip. RESULTS: The mean epiesophageal pressure significantly increased after retraction (0 mmHg: 88.7 \u00b1 19.6 mmHg: 81.9 \u00b1 15.3 mmHg). The mean endoesophageal pressure minimally changed after retraction (9.0 \u00b1 6.6 mmHg: 15.7 \u00b1 13.8 mmHg: 17.0 \u00b1 14.3 mmHg). The mean location of the posterior border of thyroid cartilage was 1.2 \u00b1 0.4 cm from the distal retractor tip.",

Although public schools strive to meet the needs of parents who, as taxpayers, fund the educational system, little is known about parental desires regarding sexuality education in states with mandated abstinence education. The objective of this study was to assess parental opinion about sexuality education in public schools in North Carolina, a state with mandated abstinence education. METHODS: Computer-assisted, anonymous, cross-sectional telephone surveys were conducted among 1306 parents of North Carolina public school students in grades K-12. Parental support for sexuality education in public schools and 20 sexuality education topics was measured. We defined comprehensive sexuality education as education that includes a discussion of how to use and talk about contraception with partners. RESULTS: Parents in North Carolina overwhelmingly support sexuality education in public schools (91%). Of these respondents, the majority (89%) support comprehensive sexuality education. Less than a quarter of parents oppose teaching any specific topic, including those typically viewed as more controversial, such as discussions about sexual orientation, oral sex, and anal sex. Parents' level of education was inversely related to support for specific sexuality education topics and comprehensive education, although these differences were small in magnitude. More than 90% of respondents felt that parents and public health professionals should determine sexuality education content and opposed the involvement of politicians.",

OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to study the value of adding ultrasound lymph node examination (7.5 MHz) to the routine clinical examination recommended by French guidelines in melanoma follow-up. METHODS: A cohort of melanoma patients was enrolled between 1 July 1995 and 1 July 2000 in a follow-up protocol including clinical examination performed four times a year for thick melanomas (Breslow index>or = 1.5 mm) and twice a year for thin melanomas (Breslow index<1.5 mm) according to French guidelines, and ultrasound lymph node examination performed every 6 months for thick melanomas and every year for thin melanomas. Follow-up was continued up to 1 July 2003. When clinical or ultrasound examination indicated signs of node recurrence, surgical biopsy of the involved node was performed. When ultrasound examination was only suspicious, another ultrasound examination was performed within the following 3 months. The results of both clinical and ultrasound examinations were compared with histopathology examination when node biopsy was performed. RESULTS: Ultrasound follow-up was performed for 373 patients (213 females and 160 males). Mean age at diagnosis of melanoma was 59 years (range 14-90, SD 15). In total, 1909 ultrasound examinations combined with clinical examination were analysed. Node biopsy was performed in 65 patients and demonstrated melanoma metastases in 54. Sensitivity of clinical examination was 88.4% (95% CI 84.2-92.2%) and of ultrasound examination 92.3% (95% CI 88.2-96.4%).

The aim of our project was to assess the discrepancies between methods of dynamic autoregulation testing based on CPP or ABP, and study possible differences in their prognostic value. METHOD: Intermittent recordings of intracranial pressure (ICP), ABP and middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (FV) waveforms were made in 151 anaesthetised and ventilated adult head injured patients as part of their required care. Indices of dynamic autoregulation were calculated as a moving correlation coefficient of 60 samples (total time 3 min) of 6 s mean values of FV and ABP (Mxa) or FV and CPP (Mx). Values of Mx and Mxa were averaged over multiple recordings in each patient and correlated with outcome at 6 months post injury.

        "input": "METHODS: from January 2005 to December 2007 102 consecutive patients (mean age 76.36+/-7.54 years) with severe highly-calcified de novo lesions of carotid artery undergoing CAS were prospectively observed and randomized in two groups: group 1 (N=50) underwent standard CAS, group 2 (N=52) underwent CAS with CBA. Patients with prior ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy (CEA), betablockers therapy or arrhytmias were excluded. HD was defined as periprocedural hypotension (systolic blood pressure<90 mmHg) or bradycardia (heart rate<60 beats/min). CBA angioplasty was carried out using CB coronary device, 0.014 inch compatible, from 3 to 4 mm or CB peripheral device, 0.018 inch compatible, from 5 to 6 mm in diameter, inflated at a mean-maximum value of 8.6 atmospheres; the average number of cuts per lesion was 2.7. RESULTS: Demographic and clinical characteristic of both groups at the basal conditions were comparable. HD occurred in 18/50 (36%) procedures in group 1, and in 3/52 (5.76%) in group 2. The difference between the two groups concerning HD incidence was statistically significant (P<0.001). There was a strong (P<0.001) association between HD and CBA and the OR=0.109 (95%CI 0.019-0.425) confirmed the protective role of CBA.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional design was employed to assess correlations among study variables. METHODS: Participants were 104 counselling-centre clients at a mid-size, Southwestern US university. Participant volunteers filled out the Psychological Mindedness Scale, life orientation test-revised (LOT-R), and the expectations-about-counselling questionnaire. RESULTS: Clients who reported higher levels of psychological mindedness (PM) reported greater expectations of self-involvement in counselling and greater expectations of positive outcome. In contrast, PM was not significantly related to clients' expectations about their counsellors' in-session behaviour or to expectations about their counsellors' general personality style. Dispositional optimism (LOT-R) did not play a major role in the relationship between PM and expectations about counselling.",

        "input": "BACKGROUND: Ultraviolet (UV) radiation (UVR) interacts with chromophores in cutaneous cells with consequent antigenicity. The normal response to this is a downregulation of immune responsiveness. Failure of the immune system to downregulate and to ignore transient photoantigens in human skin results in polymorphic light eruption (PLE), the commonest of the photodermatoses. UVR initiates and promotes skin cancer (SC): UV-induced immunosuppression permits the expansion of UV-mutated clones of cells which ultimately lead to SC. OBJECTIVES: Because there is increased immune surveillance and resistance to immune suppression following UVR exposure in PLE one might expect a protective effect of PLE against SC and, conversely, a reduced risk of PLE among patients with SC. METHODS: We therefore constructed a prospective case-control study to see if this were the case. Two groups were studied: a group comprising 214 patients with SC and 210 gender- and aged-matched controls, and a group comprising 100 patients with PLE and 155 gender- and aged-matched controls. Each participant answered a questionnaire aimed at establishing personal and family history of SC and photodermatoses. Skin type and exposure to UVR were also documented. RESULTS: The prevalence of PLE in people with SC was 7.5%, compared with 21.4% for controls (P<0.001). The prevalence of SC in patients with PLE was 4% compared with 7.1% for controls.",

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to critically review a nonpediatric hospital-based call center with the aim of identifying the algorithms responsible for the majority of nonessential referrals. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study performed at a tertiary medical care facility over 1 year. Telephone triage forms of children and adolescents younger than 18 years, exclusively referred by triage nurses using the Barton Schmitt protocols, were reviewed, and their ED course was evaluated by consulting the electronic medical record. \"Essential\" referrals to the ED were classified as presentations warranting immediate evaluation or referrals requiring \"essential interventions\" such as serum laboratory tests, imaging, complex procedures, intravenous medications, subspecialty consultation, or admission. RESULTS: A total of 220 patients were included in this study. Of these, 73 (33%) were classified as nonessential, whereas 147 (67%) were classified as essential.

However, antidepressant discontinuation may increase the risk of a new episode of major depressive disorder. We sought to estimate differences in the risk of developing a new major depressive episode among pregnant and postpartum women with recurrent illness who either did or did not use antidepressants. METHODS: Participants were recruited from obstetrical settings; we analyzed a subgroup of 778 women with a history of a depressive disorder. Diagnoses were determined by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview administered twice in pregnancy and once after delivery.

METHODS: The study evaluated the endometrial features of 441 naturally conceived and asymptomatic first trimester (99 tubal ectopic, 138 failing and 264 normal intrauterine) with maternal serum beta HCG levels<or=1,000 mIU/mL and indeterminate sonographic findings. RESULTS: Tubal ectopic, failing intrauterine and normal intrauterine pregnancies are statistically similar in aspect of endometrial thickness. However, trilaminar endometrial pattern was significantly less frequent in failing and normal intrauterine pregnancies but significantly more frequent in ruptured tubal pregnancies. Also the relative risk of tubal rupture is significantly higher in case of trilaminar endometrial pattern. Trilaminar endometrial pattern has a sensitivity of 21.2%, specificity of 93.9%, positive predictive value of 50.0% and negative predictive value of 80.5% for distinguishing tubal ectopic pregnancy.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Southeast Nigeria, where there is a moderate to high level of malaria resistance to chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine formulations. WTP was elicited from respondents using the bidding game (BG) and the structured haggling technique (SH). A socio-economic status (SES) index was used to examine the level of inequity in the key variables. In the benefit/cost ratios, the average cost of CT in Nigeria and price of Coartem were, respectively, used as the cost inputs while the mean WTP was the measure of benefit.

        "input": "OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess the occurrence of pediatric emergencies in the offices of family physicians and pediatricians, the preparedness to respond, and the perceived importance of being prepared. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a cross-sectional random mail survey of physicians. POPULATION: Surveys were sent to 187 family physicians and 129 pediatricians practicing in North Carolina with 75% and 86% response rates, respectively. The 169 total respondents were in community practices regularly treating children and were included for analysis. OUTCOMES MEASURED: We measured the incidence of 8 types of pediatric emergencies, the availability of 11 items for resuscitation and stabilization, whether the physician had Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) training in the previous 2 years, whether the office ever conducted a mock emergency, and beliefs about the importance of preparing for and providing emergency care to children. RESULTS: Six types of pediatric emergencies were seen in one third or more of all practices during the year. The average practice saw 4 or more pediatric emergencies in a year (family physicians = 3.8 vs pediatricians = 4.9, P<.001). Family physicians had fewer resuscitation and stabilization items than pediatricians (5.7 vs 8.6 items, P<.001) and were less prepared in terms of PALS training (19% vs 51%, P<.001). Those with PALS training were more likely to have an intraosseous needle and Broselow tape and to have conducted a mock code. Family physicians considered it is less important than pediatricians to provide such care or to be prepared to do so.",

However, the diagnosis of MEN2B is often delayed beyond childhood, at which time medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) may be regionally advanced or metastatic. We examined the extent of this delay and its impact on the treatment of MTC. METHODS: Patients in the MEN database were retrospectively analyzed to determine the age at first presentation for a MEN2B-related complaint and the subsequent time to correct diagnosis. Operative and pathology reports were reviewed to determine the extent of thyroidectomy and cervical lymphadenectomy during the initial and subsequent neck operations. RESULTS: We identified 22 patients with MEN2B, 20 were de novo cases and a M918T RET gene mutation was confirmed in 18 of the 22 patients. Median age at diagnosis of MTC was 13 years (range 6-25 years). The median delay in diagnosis was 26 months (range 0-18 years). Persistent local-regional MTC was present following the initial cervical operation in 12 of 22 patients (55%); including 4 of 13 with MEN2B diagnosed prior to initial surgery and 8 of 9 with MEN2B diagnosed after initial surgery.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients who underwent URS, laser lithotripsy, and stent placement for the management of stones from 2004/2005 (group 1) and 2009/2010 (group 2). We excluded all patients with preoperative positive cultures, preoperative antibiotics, urinary diversion, who underwent concomitant percutaneous nephrolithotomy, or had strings attached to the stents. All patients received a first-generation intravenous cephalosporin or fluoroquinolone at the time of initial intervention and had ureteral stents placed intraoperatively. Group 1 received an oral fluoroquinolone for 1 week postoperatively. Group 2 received an oral first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic peri-stent removal only. Antibiotics were appropriately changed according to the local resistance patterns. All stents were removed within 5 to 7 days. Our primary end point was symptomatic UTI. RESULTS: After the exclusion criteria, group 1 had 48 patients, group 2 had 49. There was no statistical difference in the incidence of symptomatic UTI between the two groups; each group had one UTI (2% risk) (P=0.988).

METHODS: Frequency volume charts and serum testosterone levels of patients visiting the outpatient clinic for lower urinary tract symptoms were collected and analyzed. Age, prostate volume, body mass index and the presence of comorbidities were accounted for. Frequency volume charts were analyzed for pathophysiological components of nocturnal polyuria, global polyuria, decreased nocturnal bladder capacity and increased frequency to identify associated risks. Frequency volume charts were also used to chart 8-h changes of volume, frequency and capacity to identify time diurnal interactions with risk factors based on serum testosterone levels. RESULTS: A total of 2180 patients were enrolled in the study. Multivariate analysis showed testosterone decreased 0.142\u2009ng/mL for every increase in nocturia, independent of other factors. Logistic regression analysis showed a significant difference between pathophysiological components. Decreased testosterone was shown to carry a significant independent risk for overall nocturia (odds ratio 1.60, 95% confidence interval 1.013-2.527, P\u2009=\u20090.044), and particularly nocturnal polyuria (odds ratio 1.934, 95% confidence interval 1.001-3.737, P\u2009=\u20090.027).

We studied flush flow velocities during intermittent arterial line purging using a flow regulating device with an infusion bag pump and a syringe pump system. MEASUREMENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: In this in vitro experiment we simulated flushing of a 24- and a 22-G cannula against a mean arterial pressure of 45 mmHg. Fluid flow velocities were gravimetrically measured during flushing from an infusion bag system pressurized to 100, 200, and 300 mmHg and from a syringe pump flush system after initialization of boluses of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 ml. The flow regulating device was opened for 1, 2, and 5 s. RESULTS: Both flush systems tested allowed delivery of flush flow velocities exceeding 0.5 ml/s (e.g., 22-G cannula; bag system, pressure 300 mmHg up to 0.64+/-0.08 ml/s; syringe pump, 2 ml bolus up to 0.74+/-0.05 ml/s).

STUDY DESIGN: The medical records of 290 consecutively born infants<or=30 weeks' gestational age (GA) were reviewed to identify the escalating need for vasopressors to maintain mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) at or above a level equal to the GA in completed weeks. Refractory hypotension was defined as MABP unresponsive to fluid boluses and high-dose vasopressors (dopamine and dobutamine at doses 20 microg/kg/min each and/or epinephrine) prompting the use of HC. RESULTS: Eighty-nine (30.7%) of 290 infants had refractory hypotension between postnatal days 2 and 7. Infants with refractory hypotension were more likely to have a lower birth weight and GA (P<0.001), been treated with surfactant (P=0.004) and received indomethacin for a symptomatic PDA (P<0.001). To identify the etiologic factors, a univariate analysis revealed that the use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, presence of air leaks, PDA, sepsis, hyperkalemia and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) were significantly associated with refractory hypotension.

The threat value of pain might be a decisive variable, which is not influenced alone by stimulus duration. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at comparing startle responses to tonic heat pain stimulation with varying degrees of threat. We hypothesized that the expectation of unpredictable temperature increases would evoke higher threat and thereby potentiate startle compared with the expectation of constant stimulation. METHODS: Healthy, pain-free subjects (n = 40) underwent painful stimulation in two conditions (low/high threat) in balanced order. The only difference between the two conditions was that in the high-threat condition 50% of the trials were announced to include a short further noxious temperature increase at the end. Startle tones were presented prior to this temperature increase still in the phase of anticipation. RESULTS: We observed startle potentiation in the high-threat compared with the low-threat condition, but only in those participants who took part first in the high-threat condition. Habituation could not account for these findings, as we detected no significant decline of startle responses in the course of both conditions.",
